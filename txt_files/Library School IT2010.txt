It specifically investigated men's knowledge and their level of spousal communication in relation to the use of contraceptives, their involvement in the use of condoms as a means of family planning or as a prevention of STDs especially HIV/AIDS, and their attitude to safer sex. bearing in mind the risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including HIV/AIDS.The data used were collected through interview schedule in which 300 respondents 220 men aged 20 years and above, and 80 women of reproductive age (15-49) were randomly selected and interviewed. Data were analysed in three stages i.e. Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate. The logistic regression model was used to establish the relationship between response variables and explanatory variables.The study found that knowledge of contraceptive methods was relatively high while usage was relatively low. Majority used contraceptive methods for birth spacing and for the prevention of STDs. Monogamously married men were more likely to be knowledgeable about contraceptive methods and their usage than men who were in other unions. They were also more likely to have discussed desired family size and when to stop childbearing with their partners.Awareness of STDs and its mode of transmission were relatively high while the use of condom was relatively low. Unmarried men were found to be more likely to use condom for STDs than married men. Men who were not staying with their families were more likely to have used condom for the prevention of STDs than men who were staying with their families. It was also found that the number of male respondents who had ever contracted STDs was relatively low in the study area. Polygamously married men were more likely to have contracted and treated for STDs than men who were in polygynous union. However, men who had contracted and treated for STDs 12 months prior to the survey were more likely to have changed their sexual behaviour in preventing HIV/AIDS by stopping the use of unsterilized instruments/needles rather than the use of condom and/or stick to one sexual partner than men who were not.Based on the findings, it was observed that failure of respondents to use condom or stick to one sexual partner would have great implications for the spread of STDs including HIV/AIDS. This implied that the awareness of HIV/AIDS was yet to have any positive impact on male sexual behaviour in the study area.|Theses collection|Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Contraceptives, HIV/AIDS, Family planning*||||||Adenrele Adebayo Kafayat

The ph was monitored with a ph meter, while titratable acidity was evaluated by titrating samples against naoh solution, and was calculated as % lactic acid (w/v). Tannin content was determined by modified vanillin  hydrochloric acid method. Sample extraction was done with iicl/ methanol solution and the filtrate was made to react with vanillin-hci reagent. Varying catechin concentrations were prepared to obtain a standard curve. Tannin concentrations of samples were then obtained from the catechin curve. Total viable and lactic acid bacteria (lab) counts were carried out on nutrient agar and man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) agar respectively. Lab were isolated and identified using cultural and colonial morphology complemented with biochemical tests. The isolates were screened for bacteriocin production by the deferred antagonism plate assay against escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus. Cell-free supernatants of the isolates were tested for bacteriocin activities using spot-on-lawn and agar well diffusion assays.The results showed that the ph of fermenting sorghum grains decreased while the titratable acidity increased in both varieties. Tannin contents in raw grains were 2l mg/g catechin equivalent (c.e) and 3.5mg/g c.e for red and white sorghum, respectively. These values decreased to 4.2mg/g c.e and 0.6 mglg c.e in r/ogi and w/ogi, respectively at the end of 96 hour fermentation. Total viable count increase from 1.8 x 04 cfu/ml in both varieties to 1.9 x 108 cfulml in rlogi and 3.0 x 108 in w/ogi at the end of the 96 hour fermentation. Lactic acid bacteria (lab) count increased from 3.1 x 10 cfulml to 7.9 x 07 cfu/ml in rlogi while it increased from3.5 x 10 cfulml to 3.2 x 108cfu/ml in w/ogi at the end of the fermentation period. The bacteria identified were enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, pediococcus acidilactici, lactobacillus confusus, leuconostoc paramesenteroides and streptococcus bovis. The final stage of fermentation was dominated by pediococcus pentosaceus and enterococcus faecium, accounting for 80% of total bacterial isolates. Lactobacillus confusus, leuconostoc paramesenteoides and streptococcus bovis were isolated only in r/ogi between 0 and 48 hours. The six lab identified produced inhibition against bacillus cereus ncib 6349, escherichia coli ncib 86 and staphylococcus aureus ncib 8588.In conclusion, lab were found to be important in sorghum fermentation and the isolates were capable of inhibiting the growth of enteropathogenic bacteria.|theses collection|sorghum fermentation/ogi preparation/E.coli/B.cereus/S.aureus/lactic acid bacteria/bacteriocin production/biopreservation.*||||||Adebolajo Samuel Oluwole|M|Attitude Of Male Elite In Ile-Ife   towards Male Contraception||||||Ph.D|A.I.

It also examined the knowledge base of the elites about male and female contraception with a view to employing the insight gained to design a proposal for an appropriate integrated family planning programme for Nigeria.Primary data were collected for this study using both structured and open-ended questionnaires. The respondents were selected using multistage cluster sampling technique from the mixed aggregates of clusters of elites and non-elites in OAU campus, Fajuyi and Ikoyi quarters, Ajanaku, Omole and Moremi estates. These clusters constituted the primary sampling units. The second stage involved the listing out of housing units in each of the clusters, The sampling frame comprised 844 housing units. One thousand and forty three households were obtained from the housing units. From these, 1000 men were selected using the lottery sampling method. The data were analyzed using the SPSS Computer Software package.The  study     s howed   the  age   of   the   respondent     to   range     f    rom     26-63 years    with     a    mean    of   46.  .02 years    for     the n on-    elite, a range       o f     15-   60   y ears    and      a    mean    of     44.  .37 years    for     the    elite. The median age for the two groups was 45 years. The predominant occupation was public civil service with 61.27 percent elites and 51.78 percent non-elites. Businessmen constituted 14.25 percent non-elites while 8.25 percent were elites. The professionals were 7.90 percent non-elites compared with 25.40 percent elites.The study also found that the high value placed on children and the preferential gender biased sex composition of children born into the family were major determinants of the ideal family size and fertility aspirations. Other factors included parental educational level, socio-cultural background, religious affiliation and early childhood experience, personality traits, demographic characteristics, subjective perception of norms and the prevailing value consensus of the social environment. The disparity observed between elites and non elites with regards to these variables was a reflection of the differentials in the magnitude of these factors.|theses collection|family planning/contraception/multistage cluster sampling/lottery sampling/childhood experience/personality traits/subjective perspection.*||||||Abiona Olatunde Olusesan

This \\as done to determine which host or application is generating the most traffic with a view to managing limited network resources efficiently.The software aspect of the network traffic monitoring system consisted of a wrapper script written in Perl language and other open source programs such as IPTraf, Multi Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG) and Webalizer. The wrapper script started the IPTraf program with suitable argument and sorted the output of IPTraf based on Internet Protocol (IP) address and protocol. The program was designed to restart every 30 minutes in order to ensure effective data gathering, maintain system stability, and minimize memory leaks. The traffic management was based on a cyclic multicast proxy server which was simulated using OPNET IT GURU Academic Edition version 9.1. During the simulation the following performance parameters: delay, response time and ethernet load were used to provide performance analysis between the proposed cyclic multicast proxy server and the caching proxy server.The results of the traffic analysis showed that over 80% of the traffic was Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP), 10% Domain Name Service (DNS), 5% Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) and about 3% File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Subsequently, MRTG produced a graphical overview of the traffic pattern while Webalizer produced a detailed analysis of the traffic pattern. The results of the simulation showed that in both single and multiple traffic types the global Ethernet delay experienced by the cyclic multicast server was about 20% lower than that of the existing caching server. Similarly, HTTP page response time was over 10% lower for cyclic multicast than for the cachingserver. The Ethernet load for single traffic was about 7% lower for cyclic multicast than for the caching proxy server and about 13% lower for multiple traffic.In conclusion, the cyclic multicast proxy server was found to provide a superior performance and scale better at higher traffic loads.|theses collection|wide area network/multi router traffic grafher/webalizer/hypertext transfer  protocol/file transfer protocol/proxy server*||||||Aderibigbe, Alade Fatai|M|Development Of Hydrolytic Procedures For Cassava Starch||||||M.

These included the effect of temperature on acid hydrolysis using , 0.1M- 0.5M HCI; Acid /Enzyme hydrolysis using 0.1M HCI in conjunction with fungalmyl-amyloglucosidase enzyme system and also O.1M HC1 in conjunction with Termamyl-amyloglucosidase enzyme system as well as the two enzyme systems alone. Based on the Enzyme/Enzyme starch hydrolysis theory, a mathematical model was developed and solved by fourth order Runge-Kuta numerical method using Matlab programme. A hydrolyzer was subsequently designed and constructed and its performance profile was studied.The results obtained from the studies showed that increased reaction temperature and acid concentration favoured reducing sugar production during acid hydrolysis of' cassava flour. With the optimum temperature of 70°C 0.1 M HCI an increase in percentage cassava flour slurry resulted in increased reducing sugar production. Optimum reducing sugar concentration was obtained after 10 hours at 70°C and 0.5M acid concentration in acid hydrolysis. The mean rate of hydrolysis decreased gradually with time in Acid, Acid / Enzyme and Enzyme/ Enzyme hydrolysis. The reduction in the mean rate of hydrolysis could be attributed to product inhibition. The best procedure for the production of fermentable sugar from cassava starch was achieved in Termamyl/Amyloglucosidase hydrolysis of 30% cassava flour slurry at 72°C/60°C after 85hours when a 71% Dextrose Equivalent (DE) was realised. This is comparable withresults obtained from the solution to the developed model, which revealed that at hydrolysis time of 100hours an average of 86.4% DE was achieved for Termamyl/Amyloglucosidase and 83% for Fungalmyl/amyloglucosidase at amylose and amylopectin mole fractions of 0.2 and 0.8 respectively. Kinetic study of the enzyme hydrolysis revealed a non-adherence with simple Michaelis-Menten Kinetics with or without product inhibition.The study concluded that the Enzyme/Enzyme process involving the amylase (termamyl and amyloglucoisdase) was more effective than the Acid/Enzyme processes.

It identified the different forms of thank you as a discourse marker in conversations, described the functions and frequency of thank you or its variants in conversations, and explored the factors (social and situational) affecting the different uses of thank you and its variants.Oral conversations involving the use of thank you were recorded mainly surreptitiously from eighty-eight English as Second Language discussants in four Local Government Areas: lfe Central Local Government (lfe). Boripe Local Government (Iree), Olorunnda Local Government (Osogbo) and Ilesa West Local Government (Ilesa) all in Osun State, Nigeria. In each of these locations, ten conversational texts were randomly selected, transcribed and analysed using the Pragmatic Theory and Linguistic approach employed by Aijmer (1996). In all, forty texts in which there were sixty-three occurrences of thank you and its variants in use were analysed.The findings showed that thank you had more functions than the discussants attributed to it. The study discovered that thank you could be used for seven things, namely (1) to express gratitude for a major or minor favour. (2) to express phatic feeling between two speakers, (3) to depict irony, sarcasm and brusqueness in conversations, (4) to function as a discourse marker in conversations (5) to accept a service, (6) to dismiss a person or service and (7) to express politeness in conversations. It was also observed that thank you as a variant of thanking strategies featured in use more than the other variants like thanks, i appieciate it, etcetera. The expression thank you had material and immaterial benefactions in view. Immaterial benefaction (which had to do with prayers, wishes, greetings, etcetera) attracted the higher number of thank you (i e 33=52.38%) than the material benefaction (e.g. gifts and services), which had thirty (47.62%).

Physical properties such as density, refractive index, surface tension, and viscosity of the oil samples were determined using official methods. Studies on the required Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance (HLB) of the oils were determined using blends of non-ionic emulsifying agents of known HLB values. The required HLB of liquid paraffin, whose value is documented, was also determined to validate the methods used. The effect of the emulsifier type on the stability of the essential oil emulsions was evaluated using non-ionic [sorbates (Spans; polysorbates (Tweens®)] and ionic [anionic (sodium lauryl sulphate); cationic (cetrimide)] emulsifiers. The stability of the emulsions with respect to phase volume ratio was also studied. Droplet size analysis, creaming rate as well as turbidimetry measurements were parameters used to determine the stability of the emulsions, while centrifugation was used as an accelerated stability test.The result showed that the required 1-1LB values of peppermint oil were 12.98 and 13.30, using Span 85/Tween 20 and Span 80/Tween 80 blends, respectively. The required HLB value of ocimum oil was, however, not obtained in this study as only the emulsion prepared at the highest HLB value (16.70) of the emulsifier blends was temporarily stable for a day and, subsequently, cracked within a week.

Questionnaires and interviews were the instruments used for collecting primary data. The questionnaires were administered on purposively selected political functionaries of the three selected states (Oyo, Osun and Ekiti) of Southwestern Nigeria. The questionnaires assessed participants' opinions and perceptions of evolution and development of inter-governmental fiscal relations in Nigeria, the linkage between centralisation of power and inter-governmental fiscal relations as well as the effects of such linkage on the policy actions (formulation and implementation) of the lower levels of government in Nigeria. Of the two hundred and ninety-three questionnaires administered, one hundred and ninety-two (65.5 per cent) were retrieved. To complement the data collected from questionnaires, interviews were also conducted to seek information from the three (3) commissioners of the National Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (NRMAFC) representing the selected states. The interviews focused on the appropriateness of the revenue sharing principles; the vertical sharing of the central pool account, and the distribution of tax jurisdiction. Secondary data were obtained from relevant textbooks and official documents, especially the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) publications. Data generated from the survey were subjected to both descriptive and inferential statistical analyses using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 11.0. The hypotheses formulated for the study were tested at 0.05 level of significance. The results showed that the evolution and development of inter-governmental fiscal relations in Nigeria had been largely determined by the nature and scope of her federal structure (x2 =45.95; df=3; P<0.001). It was also revealed that there existed significant relationship between centralisation of power and inter-governmental fiscal relations in Nigeria as derived from the nature of her federalism (x2 =637.69; df=4;P<0.001) (x2=421.71; df=3; P<0.001). Furthermore, the study showed that the policy actions (formulation and implementation) of the lower levels of government in Nigeria were determined by the nature of the linkage between her centralisation of power and inter-governmental fiscal relations (x2 =468.86; df 15; P<0.001).

It also analysed the factors determining staffing situation in selected Nigerian universities and assessed the human resource planning ces in the universities with the aim of drawing out the implications of the findings for ive human resource planning in the universities.The study used primary and secondary data. The secondary data were obtained frompublished documents of the National Universities Commission (NUC), the National Manpower (NMB) and the Abstract of Statistics of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). A survey research design was adopted for the primary data using a multi-stage sampling procedure. Eight universities were purposely selected, namely, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, University of PortHarcourt, PortHarcourt, University of Jos, Jos, Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, Enugu State University of Science and Technology, Enugu, and Federal University of Technology, Akure. The choice of universities reflected geographical spread, ownership, type and the generation to which the universities belong. A total of 495 copies of the questionnaires were administered to principal officers, deans and heads of departments in the selected eight universities.The analytical techniques were both descriptive and quantitative. Data were expressed in percentages, ratios, and tables for the descriptive analyses. The quantitative aspect of the study used multiple regression analysis of time    series data on students' enrolment, funding and staffing. The study showed that about two-third of the respondents indicated that stakeholders such as the regulatory authorities, staff, students and the host communities had considerable influence in the way the universities were managed.	More than 60% of the respondents indicated that the socio-political and economic situations in try meant that the universities had to adopt various measures to cope with these ns. These measures included increase in fees and extra charges; cutting of students' on, embargo on employment, mounting of revenue generating programmes and on of capital projects.In the regression analysis, the t-value (2.0203) was found to be significant for the university staff at 5% level, while the coefficient (-0.4712) was negative, suggesting that as enrolment was increasing the staffing situation was depleting. The R-Squared (0.3978) and F-'cs (1.5413) showed the explanatory power of the model. The Granger causality test that the direction of causality was from enrolment to staffing; suggesting that pressures from increased students' intake determined the level of staff recruitment.

The best results obtained from the two algorithms were found to be similar to the published results by earlier workers.It was concluded that using moi to select design weights for il approach was easier and faster than using the existing approach. Also, algorithm 2 was found to be computationally economical since the effort required in the I. approach in selecting design weights was conserved here.
