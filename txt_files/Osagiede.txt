A total of twenty-four growing pigs (Large white X Hampshire) with an initial mean body weight of 20.89 ± 0.08kg were raised on three experimental diets, to determine the effects of inclusion of WCPM (unpeeled cassava tuber and leaves with tender stems) in the diets of growing pigs on the performance, serum metabolites, haematological indices and economics of production.The study lasted 56 days. Diet 1 (control) was maize based, Diet 2 had 50% of maize in Diet 1 replaced with WCPM, while Diet 3 had 100% replacement of maize with WCPM. The WCPM contained about 9.8% crude protein. Data obtained were analyzed using analysis of variance and means were compared using Duncan's Multiple Range Test at 5% level of significant.Results showed that the daily feed intake for pigs fed with Diet 2 and 3 (0.94kg/pig) was higher than those fed with Diet 1(0.89kg/pig). Weight gains and feed conversion ratio were not significantly (P>0.05) affected by the diets. The average daily weight gain was, however, not significantly different among pigs on Diets 1, 2 and 3. Replacing maize with WCPM completely resulted in reduced cost of feed as well as reduced cost/kg weight gain of the growing pigs, with Diet 3 having the lowest unit cost of #64.60k and the control Diet, having #68.28k. The results of serum metabolites also revealed no dietary effects on serum total protein, albumin, globulin, urea, creatinine and cholesterol values of the growing pigs. The haematological indices measured also showed no dietary effect on packed cell volume, red and white blood cells, haemoglobin, and neutrophils. However, there were significant differences (P<0.05) in the lymphocytes of pigs fed the control diet, recording the highest value of 67.70% and those fed with Diet 2 with the lowest value of 50.67%. Also, pigs fed with Diet 2 recorded the highest eosinophil values 9.67%, while those on the control diet had the lowest value of 3.0%. It was concluded that WCPM can be used to replace maize completely in the diet of growing pigs without any negative effects on the performance, serum metabolites and haematological indices.|Thesis collection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |serum metabolites/X Hampshire /haematological indices/Manihotesculenta (L) Crantz/lymphocytes/creatinine     *||||||Adedigba, Jonathan Olufemi|M|A Study of Errors in the use of Tenses in the Written English of Senior Secondary School III Pupils in Selected Schools in Atisbo Local Gorvernment Area. ||||||M.A.( English as a second language)|Salami, L.

A survey of ten Secondary Schools in ATISBO Local Government Area of Oyo State was carried out using simple random sampling technique.The data for the study were collected from the pupils' written essays. In ten secondary schools in. ATISBO Local Government Area of Oyo state, Nigeria. From the essays, some errors were identified. They include the incorrect use of tense and aspect, concord errors, errors in the use of modal auxiliaries and error of pluralization.The errors were analysed and classified into major tense errors and errors related to modal auxiliaries in English. It is observed from the study that among the errors, the incorrect use of tense and aspect constituted the highest number of errors (915 occurrences or 29.62%), while the wrong use of modal auxiliaries occurred with 156 cases or 5.05% of the total number of errors committed by the pupils. The study showed that the pupils' poor performance in the use of tenses in English was a result of the interference of their mother tongue-Yoruba. It was also noted that apart from the mother tongue interference, certain factors such as the poor mastery of different structural patterns of English (e.g. subject -verb concord) were also contributing to the pupils' poor performance. The study concluded that in order to improve the pupils' mastery of English tenses and their usage, efforts should be made to lay a sound foundation for the learning of English language in the senior secondary school because English language is the pivot on which other subjects revolve. Therefore, we suggested that teachers should employ appropriate teaching methods for proper understanding of the teaching and learning processes because teachers' utterances are taken as the gospel truth by the pupils. Finally, we recommended that results of educational resea rches should be incorporated into the curriculum by planners and policy makers in education.|Thesis collection|concord errors/modal auxiliaries/mother tongue-Yoruba/ structural patterns .*||||||Agorzie, Claudius Jamike|M|A study of  the application of operations research methodology in corporate decision-making in selected manufacturing firms in Nigeria   ||||||Ph.D.Business Administration|Nassar, M.

Several others argue that suchdecision-making technique is irrelevarit to the business operations of the developing countries, and thus are not used there. This study examined the levelof application and relevance of OR in the manufacturing sector of the Nigerian economy. The influence of such application on corporate performance was alsodetermined.Random sampling technique implemented by random number process was used to select a sample of 43 public limited companies (plcs) using the list of quoted companies in the 2001 Annual Reports and Accounts of the Securities and Exchange Commission as sampling frame. The purposive sampling technique was used to select six (6) managers from the six key areas of each of those sampled firms to give a total of 258 that served as respondents.The key areas of the firms used were OR unit, operations, production/factory, R & D, management information systems and marketing/finance. A questionnaire study was conducted on those selected managers to provide the primary data. The Stock Exchange and Annual Reports and Audited Accounts of responding firms were some of the sources of secondary data.Descriptive statistics such as cross tabulation, the arithmetic mean and percentages were used in analyzing the data. Non-parametric statistics (Pearson's chi-square and Mann-Whitney rank-sum U test) techniques were used to test the nondirectional hypotheses of the study. The result showed that there is a low level of awareness, appreciation of and familiarity with OR in the manufacturing sector. Informally, OR models were used by the firms, but they were predominantly of the judgment-orientated type. However, the OR philosophy and methodology were clearly evident in the decision-making procedure of the corporations. Of the firms that reported frequent/extensive application of OR techniques, 75% were of the indigenous/foreign ownership while 25% were indigenous ones. The Chemical/Pharmaceuticals subsector had the highest number of   frequent users of  OR and they exhibited more consistent superior corporate performance. Firms that applied operations research techniques in their business management had higher average profitability and efliciency financial ratios. Among the firms using operations research, 80% exhibited more superior average corporate performance than their nonuser counterparts.The study concludes that the level of application of operations research in the manufacturing sector of the Nigerian economy is still at the informal and rudimentary stages. Low level of awareness, appreciation of and famiIiarity with OR among the managers are some of the major barriers it must overcome in order to thrive there. Foreign ownership of firms is having a positive impact on  the application of  OR  in the manufacturing sector. Positive influence of  OR application on corporate performance establishes its relevance in the Nigerianmanufacturing business environment.|Thesis collection|operation research/corporate performance/ judgment-orientated/Non-parametric statistics/Pearson's chi-square*||||||Adigun, Adijat Adebisi|F|Development of a Routing Technique for an Ad-Hoc Wireless Network||||||M.

The network layer was modeled using an undirected graph, while the routing layer utilized Dijkstra algorithms to find the shortest path between source and destination node. To update the routing tables, mobile agents were embedded within the agent layer. The following performance parameters were specified: cell loss ratio (CLR), cost of routing and throughput. The proposed model was simulated using Java language. The data obtained from the simulation were analysed using Microsoft Excel Software.The results of the simulation showed that the routed packets were fewer than the loss packet when the number of nodes was between 0 and 19, and this resulted in high cell loss ratio (CLR). When the number of nodes was increased to 20 and above the CLR reduced drastically, but the cost of agent hosting increased the cost of routing as more nodes were added. Also as the CLR decreased the throughput of the model increased.It was concluded that the model was more efficient but expensive to route using mobile agent since the CLR was low and the transmission of messages from node to node was through the smallest number of hops.|Thesis collection|Routing/Wireless network/Network layer/Agent layer/Routing layer/Cell loss ratio*||||||Akinnubi Caroline Funmi|F|Sexual Behaviour And Contraceptives Practices Among Adolescent Students In Secondary Schools In Rural And Urban Areas Of Ondo West Local Government.Ondo State.||||||M.A. Physical and Health Education|Fawole, J.O||, Ile-Ife, Nigeria | Obafemi Awolowo University, Physical And Health Education |2005|||OAU|||||ix, 86p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The overall objective was to guard the students towards maintaining sexual rectitude.Twelve secondary schools were purposively selected for the study. The first six secondary schools selected comprised the two only girls' and the two only boys' secondary schools as well as two co-educational secondary schools in the urban areas. Six other co-educational secondary schools from the rural areas were also selected. The respondents for the study consisted of three hundred and sixty male and three hundred and sixty female Senior Secondary School Students from the selected twelve secondary schools in the areas. A structured questionnaire, consisting of two sections (A and B) was used to collect information from the respondents. Section A sought demographic information (school, sex, age and class) while section B elicited information regarding the respondents' sexual behaviours, knowledge of contraception, sources of contraceptive information and support for the use of contraceptive devices. Descriptive and Chi square statistics were used to analyse the data.The results revealed that 222 (61.7%) respondents in rural areas and 238 (66.1%) respondents in the urban areas male and female partners. Sixty-four (35.6%) male respondents and 75 (41.7%) female respondents in the rural areas, compared to 96 (53.3%) male respondents and 111 (61.7%) female respondents in the urban areas stated that they had never engaged in sexual intercourse. With regard to the awareness of contraceptives, 141 (89.2%) male respondents and 101 (28.1%) female respondents in the rural areas compared to 9 (24.1%) male respondents and 125 (34.7%) female respondents in the urban areas stated that they were aware of contraceptives. Likewise 142 (39.9%) male respondents and 146 (40.6%) female respondents in the rural areas compared to 169(46.9%) male respondents and 155 (43.1 %) female respondents in the urban areas confirmed that they were aware of sexuality. A total of 40 (11.1%) respondents in the rural areas and 38 (10.6%) respondents in the urban areas indicated that they currently used contraceptives compared to 317 (88.1%) respondents in the rural areas and 320 (88.9%) respondents in the urban areas who indicted that they never used contraceptives. The major source of information on sexuality was from parents with 289 (80.3%) respondents in the rural areas and 297 (82.5%) respondents from urban areas. On the other hand, 285 (79.2%) respondents in the rural areas and 278 (77.2%) respondents in the urban areas affirmed that their major source of information on contraceptives was from friends. Those who obtained information from peer groups were significantly higher than those who got information from any other source. Majority of the respondents 484 (67.2%) stated that they never used contraceptives. There was a significant difference in the sources where contraceptives were obtained (X2 = 14.07, df = 6 P>0.05).The study concluded that even though secondary school students in the rural and the urban areas of Ondo West Local Government were aware of contraception and practised sexuality, yet these facts did not influence their sexual behaviours, as majority of the respondents had never used any of the contraceptives.|Thesis collection|Chi square/contraceptives/peer groups/sexual behaviours/ Ondo West*||||||Ako Rhuks Temitope|M|An Appraisal of the Recognition and Enforcement of Environmental Human Rights for the Sustainable Development of the Niger Delta||||||M.Phil.

The primary sources were the statutes, prominent among which was the Constitution. The secondary sources were books, journal articles, reports, conference proceedings, newspapers, and magazines. Nigeria's legal provisions and policies were critically examined to determine the state of the law in Nigeria vis-à-vis the recognition and enforcement of environmental rights in the absence of substantive environmental rights.The study revealed that though there were several provisions of laws that had bearing on environmental rights in Nigeria, they were inchoate. It revealed further that environmental degradation, poverty and human rights abuses that were the root causes of restiveness in the Niger Delta were consequences of the inadequate legal provisions to ensure substantive environmental rights. It showed that the recognition of substantive environmental rights in Nigeria will apportion legally enforceable roles and responsibilities on all the stakeholders in the region and will limit recourse to extra-judicial methods of resolving conflicts.These rights and responsibilities include the recognition of citizens' rights to a healthy environment, active public participation and access to environmental justice. Furthermore, the recognition and enforcement of substantive environmental rights will not impose additional legal imperatives on oil companies that will dissuade foreign investments in Nigeria but rathar promote them through     ensuring stability and peace in the business climate.The study concluded that environmental issues had become pertinent under the globalization agenda where Transnational Corporations (TNCS) are the foremost driving forces leaving the economies and people of the Niger Delta more vulnerable to their operations. It recommended that constitutional recognition to substantive environmental rights protection and enforcement was the panacea to the sustainable development of the region's people and resources as well as the Nigerian state| Thesis collection|Transnational Corporations/Niger Delta / Nigeria vis-à-vis/substantive environmental rights/globalization agenda *||||||Alumona Maureen Nwadimkpa|M|An Assessment of Adult Literacy Classes in Ife-North Local Government Area of Osun State, 1996-2001 (Achievements, Problems And Solutions)||||||M.A. ED.

About three people were directly and verbally  interviewed from the six major quarters of the town. These were selected through the direction of other performers. Structural analysis of the music was done. Although so much research has not been done on this subject, not withstanding references were made to the related ones.The thesis found that Ose compositions were derived from traditional idioms of the society and their creativity was based on the guiding principles of Yoruba music development such as the melody, rhythm, accompaniment and form-call and response, repetition and speech tone.In conclusion, the thesis investigated the social context and the compositional techniques of Ose, a post-burial music in Itaogbolu. It has revealed the importance of the music in the ritual observances among the people.

The study aimed at providing information on workers assessment and perception of the performance appraisal system in determining its relevance in public service.The samples for this study were four hundred and eight staff comprising 241 males and 167 females within the ages of 21 and 59 years drawn purposively from six ministries: the Ministries of Education (66) Finance and Economic Planning (72): Health (70): Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs (65) Agriculture and Natural Resources (65): and information. Culture & Youth Development (70) at the state secretariat Abere. Osogbo. Data were collected through the administration of questionnaire. The data collected were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. All the five hypotheses formulated for the study were tested at 0.05 level of significance, using the t-test, one-way analysis of variance and multivariate analysis of variance.The study showed statistical significance among workers assessment of  the appraisal system with, F = 19.97(P<0.05). That is workers who had a good cognitive assessment of the appraisal system were positively inclined toward the system. The findings also showed statistical significance of the workers' number of  years in service on their perception of appraisal system as F = 6.53 (P<0.05). That is. workers. with longer number of years in service perceived performance appraisal process as the precursor to better performance. There were no significance gender differences in the way workers perceived performance appraisal process as t =1.134 (P>0.05). In the same vein. workers perception of appraisal process was not significantly influenced by their level of education with F= 0.76 (P>0.05). Finally, workers, both in the senior and junior cadres were not significantly different in their perception of the state appraisal system as t = 0.117(P>0.05).The study concluded that workers had good assessment of the state performance appraisal system and were satisfactorily disposed to the practice.|Thesis collection|appraisal process/workers assessment/Chieftaincy Affairs/multivariate analysis/workers perception.*||||||Ebhodaghe, Stella Osaruguenomwan |F|A Study Of Probiotic Bacteria In Soymilk||||||M.Sc.

The bacteria isolates were then identified based on cultural, morphological and biochemical characteristics. The pure cultures of bifidobacteria isolates were used to inoculate sterilized soymilk and their growth monitored at both room and refrigeration temperatures over a period of five weeks. The pH and titratable acidity of the samples were determined, amino nitrogen was measured using formol titration method. The inhibitory effect of the probiotic isolates on selected foodborne bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was assayed by the broth culture method.The results showed that the isolated probiotic bacteria were Bifidobacteria longum, B. adolescentis , Lactobacillus plantarum and L. salivarius. B. longum was found to be viable in the soymilk, while B, adolescentis was not. The former isolate grew in the soymilk and caused a decrease in the pH values from 5.72 to 4.36 and 5.35 for samples stored at room and refrigeration temperatures respectively. An increase in titratable acidity values from 0.17 to 0.54 for samples stored at room temperature and from 0.17 to 0.18 for samples stored at refrigeration temperature was observed. A general trend of decreasing values were observed from 5.16 to 4.43 and 4.50 for total solids, 1.28 to 0.75 and 1.09 for total reducing sugar and 3.75 to 1.21 and 1.24 for carbohydrate, in samples stored at room and refrigeration temperatures, respectively. The crude protein content of the soymilk increased from 1.76 to 2.14 for room temperature and 1.76 to 1.96 for refrigeration temperature while there was no appreciable change in the amino nitrogen content of both samples. B. longum exhibited a positive inhibitory effect on two food borne pathogens, E. coli and S. aureus, E. coli being better inhibited.It was concluded that soymilk was a suitable substrate for the formulation of probiotic beverage using one of the bifidobacteria isolates from breast fed infants.|Thesis collection|bifidobacteria/intestinal microbia/ broth culture method/formol titration/ room and refrigeration temperatures *||||||Akinlade, Grace Olubunmi| F|Investigation of Boundary Layer Winds over Ile-Ife as  Monitored by a Sodar System||||||M.Sc.

It also compared the diurnal and mean monthly variation of the wind fields over the station.The horizontal wind vector was retrieved from the data set and used for the following analysis. The power law exponent (k) was computed over Ile-Ife for the months of June and February 1991 to represent wet and dry seasons respectively. Variation in k values was also studied for night-time and day-time situations to determine the effect of stability over the wind profile. The mean wind variation with height was analysed. Special case studies were investigated and compared to the physical observations made at the same period over the station. The wind field was analysed on diurnal basis and compared with the behaviour of solar radiation fluxes.For the month of June, exponent k was found to increase almost linearly with height up to 450 m after which it began to decrease with increasing height. The average value was 0.58±0.01. However, for February, k increased steadily with height from 25 m to 500 m, the average value being 0.47±0.03. For the day-time, average k value (0.42±0.02) was found to be smaller than for the night-time (0.75±0.04). Also, it decreased in a steady manner with height for the night-time situation while it varied in an undulating manner with height for the day-time situation. The variation of the mean wind speed with height was found to be logarithmic for the month of February while a power law relationship holds for the month of June. It was clearly demonstrated that the sodar system is able to detect squall occurrence and accurately record the time over which it prevails. The diurnal analysis of the wind reveals that the wind varies with time (as the radiation fluxes), attaining a maximum between the hours of 1400 and 1900 and a minimum between the hours of 0300 and 0700 Hours, while the radiative fluxes have their maximum at 1300 Hours.In conclusion, the diurnal wind speed maximum lags behind the radiation maximum for a period of about one hour. Furthermore, the sodar system proves to be a very vital instrument in probing the atmospheric boundary layer being able to monitor on a continuous basis the wind field and automatically record it.|Thesis collection|acoustic sounder data/solar radiation fluxes/wind field/sodar system/diurnal analysis *||||||Daramola,  Olusanjo Matthew|M|The Musical Concept of the Alasalatu in Yoruba Islamic Music||||||Ph.D. Music|Vidal, A.

It explored the origin, development, structure and design of the music of the Alasalatu socio-religious women's groups among Yoruba Muslims in order to understand its concept as a mode of musical expression within the Yoruba cultural and musical substratum.The methodology included the collection of sound and social data in situ as well as observer-participation in music-making events connected with Alasalatu. The consultation of' literature on Islamic religion and Islamic music among the Yoruba with special attention to oral literature dealing with the music of the Alasalatu also formed part of the methods for data collection and analysis. Data was analyzed within the framework of ethnomusicological theoryIt was found that the music of the Alasalatu could be grouped into three styles, namely rara, waka and the dhikr. Some of the features of rara and waka identified were a pentatonic orientation which formed the dominating scale pattern, a rhythmic organization by proportion and meter, a monophonic texture, an occasional incidental harmony and non-Western derived melodic cadences. The cadences showed that a movement from submediant or supertonic to the tonic was prevalent in about 76.25 per cent of the data with a melodic identity of definite and indefinite pitch degrees, shakes and trills. Although the three genres shared common features, Dhikr was more aligned with Quranic chanting by virtue of intricacies in its style than rara and waka. It was observed that the instrumental accompaniment usually enhanced the performance of the music, though its absence would not affect the music negatively. The appreciation of the music was based on aesthetics principles of Islamic and Yoruba cultural and musical traditions.The study concluded that, the Alasalatu groups among the Yoruba Muslims were not only religious organizations but were also exponents of social and musical ideas. The structural, aesthetic and artistic values prevalent in their music as well as in Sakara, .Apala, Fuji, Awurebe, and other Yoruba Islamic music were primarily those of the Yoruba. Though the use of the word "music" among the Yoruba Muslims was highly restrained, the structure and design of the music of the Alasalatu were based on its elements.Finally, the study concluded that Alasalatu women constituted a powerful agent of social change through their musical expressions.|Thesis collection|Quranic chanting/Alasalatu/rara/waka/dhikr/awurebe/sakara/apala*||||||Ashaolu, Olufunmilayo Omolara|M|Strategies for Minimizing Noise Pollution in Selected Sawmills in Osun State||||||M.Sc.

Four groups of respondents were purposively selected for this study. The first group comprised of 150 sawmill workers with 25 workers chosen from each of the six Local government Areas under study. These are Irewole, Ife-Central,   Ayedaade, lIesha-West, Ife-East and Ife-South Local Government Areas. The second group comprisedof 150 Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) Library workers and users representing less noisy area as the control. The third group comprised of 12 sawmill owners within the study area, while the fourth group were 5 top management staff of the Osun State Environmental Protection Agency (OSEPA). Ear examinations were carried out on the sawmill workers and the control using autoscopy and tuning fork tests, in order to compare the extent of hearing loss between them. Three sets of questionnaire were designed for the study. The first set elicited information about workers perception of health impact of excessive noise; while the second elicited information on hearing conservation strategies adopted by sawmill owners. The third set was designed for OSEPA staff to investigate Government policy strategies for noise control in Osun State.The results revealed that all saw mill workers 150 (100%) claimed that excessive noise had a negative impact on their health but were not quite aware of the damage it had done to their hearing. About seventy percent claimed that excessive noise led to inability to sleep and concentrate on their jobs, twenty percent claimed that it resulted in annoyance and low productivity while only sixpercent linked it to hearing loss. Ear examination results on saw mill workers however showed that only 20.0% had normal hearing while 92.7% of the sample used as control, had normal hearing. The strategies designed by the Federal Government to control noise pollution in sawmills included noise surveys, engineering controls and noise awareness programmes among others. Thesawmill owners are unaware of these strategies. Out of the 12 sawmill owners sampled, none provided any hearing conservation programme for their sawmill and  83.3% could not identify hearing protection devices. No sawmill had Environmental Health Safety Section. Only 10% of the sawmill workers put on their hearing protection while 90.0% did not.In conclusion, the result showed that the sawmill workers were not aware of Government strategies for noise control in sawmills. They were not also aware that excessive noise could lead to  hearing loss; however the results of this study confirmed that hearing loss was associated with excessively noisy environment.|Thesis collection|noise pollution/OSEPA/autoscopy/sawmill/tuning fork tests/hearing loss/noise awareness                     *||||||Fakunle, Ponle Bamidele|M|A Study of Some Effects of Chronic Administration of Ethanol on the Superior Colliculus and Lateral Geniculate Body of Adult Wistar Rats (Rattus norvegiclls)   ||||||M.Sc.

This study is aimed to determine the involvement of intracranial visual relay centers lateral geniculate body (LGB) and superior colliculus (SC) in this mechanism. A total of 40 adult wistar rats, average weight 200g, were used for the study. They were randomly assigned into 4 groups (n = 10) each, of treatment (Tl and T2) and control (Cl and C2). The treatment rats Tl and T2 received 25% ethanol in 2% sucrose solution as their  drinking water while the control group Cl and C2 were given tap water and 2% sucrose solution respectively. All groups were exposed for a period of six weeks, except T2 animals that were allowed an extra 2-week ethanol withdrawal period. The animals were sacrificed and the brain specimens trimmed to the regions of LGB and SC, and processed for paraffin embedding (sectioned at 6µm thickness and stained with H&E and Cresyl violet for nissl staining), cryostat embedding (cryosectioned at 10µmthickness and stained histochemically for SDH activity), samples were homogenized at 4°C for biochemical assay. Histological findings showed slightly enlarged and distorted cells, with reduced neuroglia in the LGB & SC of the treatment groups compared to the control groups, which appeared normal. Staining intensity for SDH activity was reduced in both the LGB & SC of the treatment groups compared to the controls. Biochemical estimation of enzymatic activity and protein concentration of  SDH in LGB and SC were significantly reduced (P <0.05) in the treatment groups (mean±sem, 0.400±0.001) compared to the control groups (mean±sem, 1.100±0.002).These findings indicate that chronic consumption of ethanol has deleterious effects on the microanatomy of LGB and  SC. The reduced staining intensity and biochemical quantificationof  SDH suggests that ethanol also impairs the process of carbohydrate metabolism via Kreb's cycle in the neurons of the visual relay centers, which may consequently impair visualsensibilities and hence vision. |Thesis collection|lateral geniculate body/cryostat embedding/superior colliculus/wistar rats/Kreb's cycle*||||||Gasu, Martin Binde |M|Physico-Chemical Properties of  Soils under Municipal Solid Waste Open Dump Sites in Ife East Local Government Area of  Osun  State, Nigeria.||||||M.Sc.

Four dump sites along Ife-Ifewara road and a secondary forest as the control were purposively selected for the study. Each sample site was divided into four quadrants of 3m by 3m. Composite replicate soil samples were collected from three of the four quadrants randomly at different depths (0-15 cm), (15-30 cm) and (30-50 cm) using a stainless steel  Dutch auger during wet and dry seasons. The samples were taken to the laboratory, air-dried, sieved and the less than 2mm fractions analysed for Organic matter (OM), pH, particle size distribution using standard methods, Exchangeable bases (Ca, Mg, K and Na) and heavy metals were determined using colorimetric method and Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) respectively after extraction with Iml of HNO3 and 3ml of HCI (aqua regia in the ratio 1:3). Also edible plants growing on the dump sites were also collected, dried and analysed for their Zn, Pb, Cd and Cu contents after digestion with 2ml H2SO4 and heated on a hot plate at a temperature of 4500 and leached with hydrogen peroxide  . The study revealed that municipal solid waste dump sites varied in their physico-chemical properties from one dump site to the other. Percentage sand, silt and organic matter (OM) ranged between 60.1 - 71.2%, 10.9- 16.8%and 3.9 - 5.6% in the dry season respectively and 61.7 - 70.0%, 13.1 - 16.8% and 2.7 - 3.9% for % in the wet season respectively. Percentage sand, silt and OM decreased with increasing depth in all the dump sites with the exception of clay which ranged from 15.3-23.8% and 15.1-26.2% and increased with increasing depth in the dry and wet seasons respectively. Theexchangeable bases K, Na, Ca and Mg ranged between 1.50 - 2.20 Cmol kg-1, 0.82 - 1.05 Cmol Kg-1, 11.10 - 12.8 Cmol Kg-1 and 5.7 - 6.6.10 Cmol Kg-1 in the wet season respectively and 2.0 - 3.1 Cmol Kg-1, 0.55 - 7.2 Cmol Kg-1, 11.1-16.3 Cmol Kg-1 and  6.7 - 10.1 Cmol Kg-1 in the dry season respectively.The heavy metals contents of Zn, Cu, Cd ranged from1.50-3.07µg g-1, 0.23-0.57µg g-1 and   0.7- 1.17µg g-1 respectively, these values were within the tolerable/critical level, with the exception of Pb which had a high value of 109.7µg g-1 above the WHO critical value of 100µg g-1. The study revealed further a high transfer ratio (TF) of heavy metals from soil to plants. The TF values of Pb in pumpkin and cocoyam were 4.5 and 4.05 respectively whilst .TF for Cu in cocoyam was 2.5 and Zn in pumpkin was 2.40. These values reflected soil contamination.In conclusion,the study showed that the soil physico-chemical properties varied greatly among the dump sites. The high metal transfer ratios indicated soil and plantcontamination.|Thesis collection| transfer ratio/Atomic Absorption  Spectrophotometer/colorimetric/physico-chemical/municipal solid waste *||||||Ilesanmi, Adetokunbo Oluwole|M|An Evaluation of Selected Public Housing Schemes of Lagos State Development and Property Corporation, Lagos, Nigeria.||||||Ph.D. Architecture|Ogunshakin, L.

The specific objectives were to: analyze LSDPC's institutional framework and housing delivery process; assess the physical characteristics of selected LSDPC schemes; examine the residents' socio-economic characteristics; examine user responses to the housing delivery process and to the schemes; and analyze the relationships between user responses, user characteristics, and the physical characteristics of the schemes. Primary data were obtained from: (i) key management staff responsible for decision making, by means of in-depth interviews and (ii) structured questionnaire administered on a systematic sample of  806 household heads, from a sampling frame of 8,060 housing units based on a purposive sample of 5 low-income and 3 medium-incomeestates, out of a total of 28 estates (20 low-income and 8 medium-income). The quantitative data was subjected to both descriptive and inferential statistics. Results of correlation analysis showed high, positive correlation between perception of equity and residential satisfaction levels of residents. Significant correlations were also established between residential satisfaction and age range (r = 0.389), duration of residency (r = 0.288), ownership status (r = -0.273), socio-economic status (r = -0.250), educational attainment (r = -0.205), and household size (r = 0.180). Also, significant correlations were found between perception of equity and age range (r = 0.317), length of residency (r = 0.224), household size (r = 0.140), socio-economic status (r = -0.162), educational attainment (r = -0.130), and ownership status (r = -0.177), at 0.05 level of significance. The R2 value of 0.737 from regression analysis implies that residents' satisfaction with the physical characteristics of their neighborhood, the management of the estates, and the procedure for obtaining their housing, and residents' perception of equity in privacy, in housing fit, in housing choice, and in  housing flexibility, explain 73.7 percent of the total variation of residential satisfaction. The study concluded that, for housing to be satisfactory, it should be perceived to be equitable. In addition an institutional framework and housing delivery process that engender equity, are more likely to result in residents' satisfaction with public housing.|Thesis collection|public housing schemes/housing delivery process/ownership status/residents' perception/housing flexibility*||||||Isogun, Monday Adeyemi|M|Quantitative Interpretation of Aeromagnetic Data of  Chad Basin, Borno State.

The data were processed by calculating the mean over a rectangular area defined by a given filter length for each data point. Different filter lengths of 6 km, 7 km and 8 km were tried. However, the 7 km filter length was the most appropriate and hence used for the interpretation. Two computer programs in Pascal language were written to interpret the processed data. The first program calculated depth to center of a spherical magnetic body using different derived formulae while the second calculated the total magnetic field of 3-dimensional vertical prismatic models. In addition, a commercial software (GM-SYS) was also used for the interpretation. The results from the first program showed that depth to basement ranged between 3.1 km and 4.4 km. The results from the second program showed that depth to magnetic bodies ranged between 0.3 km and 4.2 km and their magnetizations ranged between 0.18 A/m and 11 A/m. Synthetic total magnetic field map generated over prismatic models correlated to the filtered aeromagnetic data. The results obtained from GM-SYS showed that depth to basement varied between 2.5 km and 4.3 km. Two areas that fall approximately between latitudes 11°361N, 12°461N and 11°401N, 12°361N andlongitudes 13°E, 14°E and 14°301E,15°E respectively and whose sediments' thicknesses were averagely in excess of 3.8 km were delineated as possible areas of interest for hydrocarbon accumulation. The results further revealed that the basement structure is characterized by large number of intrusions most of which are shallow (less than 700 m).It was concluded that the study area had the potential for petroleum accumulation due to the likely structural deformations the shallow intrusive bodies would create in the basement and in the overlying sediments that could serve as hydrocarbon traps.|Thesis collection|Aeromagnetic data/commmercial software/hydrocarbon traps/subsurface geology/chad basin/prismatic models/ GM-SYS*||||||Wojuade,  Christopher Adesola|M|A Study of Intra-Urban Traffic Delay at Beere and Mokola Nodes in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria.||||||M.

Both primary and secondary sources of data were used. The primary source included information on the volumetric count of traffic on the roads, collection of information on traffic delay by observatory method and attitudinal survey of 300 incidental road users at the bus stops in the study area. Secondary data were obtained from Government Agencies in Oyo State. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistical techniques. The study showed that Mokola Node had average passenger car units of 94271 per day with maximum space mean speed of 31 km/h and minimum of 22 km/h against the standardized 50 km/h recommended speed limit for urban areas in the Nigerian Highway Code. Beere Node had average passenger car units of 89513 per day with maximum space mean speed of 37 km/h and minimum of 25km/h. The study also showed that the total delay caused at Mokola Node per week is 9952 cases taking a total of 4259:47 minutes. Furthermore, the total delay caused at Beere Node per week is 6639 cases taking a total of 2935:33 minutes. The study showed that passengers spent a mean of 38:54 minutes in traffic delay per day or an estimated 169:22 hours per year at Mokola Node. Also, passengers spent an average of 30:42 minutes in traffic delay per day or an estimated 133:32 hours per year at Beere Node. These figures in Ibadan are more than twice compared to what obtained in very large cities in the developed countries like the United States of America. The study revealed further that passengers lost an average delay cost of N38 per day or N9,918 per year at Mokola Node and N26 per day or N6,786 per year at Beere Node. The respondents (98.7%) indicated that delay caused time wasting, failure to meet appointments (89%), discomfort (87.3%), lateness to work (86.4%), tiredness (85%), anger (83%), waking up early (77%), returning home late (75.7%) and street fighting (67.3%).  The study concluded that there is a serious occurrence of traffic delay on the roads in the study area, particularly at the peak hour travel times at major intersections and roundabouts and these are caused by improper parking, negotiation of roundabouts, turning at road junctions and pedestrian crossings.|Thesis collection|intra-urban traffic/Beere/Mokola Nodes/pedestrian crossing/attitudinal survey/Nigerian Highway Code*||||||Salami, Onovroghene Marie|F|The Effects of Guided Reading Approach and Pre-Lesson Assignments on Achievement in Biology among Secondary School Students in Osun State||||||M.

It assessed students' level of readability and comprehension andcompared the performance of students exposed to guided reading and pre-lesson assignments and those not exposed to them.The design of the study was pre-test and post-test with a control group. The population of the study was the senior secondary school year two students (SS2) in Osun state. The sample was 250SS2 students randomly selected from a co-educational school in Ife East Local Government Area. The average age of the students was 17. Four independent variables (three treatments and one control) were investigated. The three treatments were Guided Reading Approach (GRA), Pre-Lesson Assignment Method (PLAM) and Guided Reading with Pre-Lesson Assignment Method (GRPLAM). Lecture method served as the control. Digestive and transport systems were the two topics covered for six weeks. Level of difficulty, P( 25% < x < 75% ) and discriminating index D,   (0.25 < x < 0.75) were used to pick thirty questions out of sixty questions drawn from the topics. The questions were use for the pre-test as well as post-test. The performance of the students were analyzed using t-test statistics, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Scheffe test.The results showed that exposure to GRA improved performance of students than Conventional Method, CM (tc = 11.00 >  tt = 1.98,  df  = 71,  p <  0.05 ). Students exposed to PLAM performed better than those exposed to CM (tc =10.30 > tt =1.98, df =71, p  <  0.05 ). The study also revealed that a combination of the two methods, GRPLAM resulted in better achievement than CM ( tc = 6.42 > tt = 1.98, df = 75, p < 0.05 ). Furthermore, the results showed that GRA is as effective as PLAM (tc =0.2  < tt = 1.98, df =68, p < 0.05 ). It was revealed that each of GRA and PLAM brought about as much achievement as GRPLAM ( tc =0.04 < tt  1.98, df = 72, p < 0.05 ) and (tc =0.27 < tt = 1.98, df = 7, p < 0.05 ).

The 2003 general elections result showed 3.5% of the positions occupied by women as against 1.8% in the 1999 election. This did not include women performance in the local government elections. The study equally showed that a greater number of women participated in the South than in the North. This could be as a result of the prevailing religious and cultural heritage. Also, the fact that women gained political suffrage earlier in 1954 in the South as against those in the North who gained theirs in 1976 was probably responsible for the more extensive participation of women in the South. The study further showed that the existenceof thirty political parties in the 2003 electoral process gave women more impetus in the current political dispensation than were the cases in 1993 and 1999 which featured only two and nine political parties respectively. Thus in 2003, women had the opportunity to feature at all levels of the electoral process as party flagbearers and for the first time ever four women contested at the presidential level. The findings conclusively showed that in 1993, women occupied 2.1% of the elected positions. This dropped to 1.6% in 1999 and went up again to 3.5% in 2003.The study concluded that the involvement of the Nigerian women in  politics was a gradual process. Thus, women had to participate more actively to secure their rightful proportional representation in governance.|Thesis colection|democratization process/women's participation/Third and Fourth Republics/party flagbearers/electoral process *||||||Inyang, Isaac Anietye|M|Development of a Virtual Instrumentation System for Remote Measurement of some Meteorological Variables.||||||M.

Transducers and signal conditioners for relative humidity, light intensity and temperature were designed, constructed and calibrated. Then a digital interface to link the transducers to computer systems was designed and constructed. A computer programme for fast data acquisition and analysis was also developed. The software was used to measure relative humidity, temperature and light intensity from the constructed sensors. The software also handled the exchange of data between remotely located computers on the network. Data storage at specified nodes on the network was also implemented. Transducers for relative humidity, light intensity and temperature were set up in both the Physics Department and the Centre for Space Science and Technology. The software was used to measure, process and transmit data to the Obafemi Awolowo University network. Monitoring nodes were set up in the Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department to monitor the data transmitted from the sensors. The data measured were later compared with the data received. The time taken to deliver the data was noted.The result showed that data were being lost as a result of the program having to measure, monitor, process, store and display data all at once. This problem was solved by the use of multithreading to enable a single instance of the programme to spawn several threads of activities. This resulted in an enhanced performance as relative humidity, temperature and light intensity were finally acquired remotely from different parts of the campus with minimal error. Data was successfully acquired and stored on a server in the Physics Department. This result showed that using the university network for remote measurement did not reduce the accuracy of the expected output as these were obtained in real-time with high accuracy.The study concluded that using available networking technologies, data acquisition hardware, sensors and servers, data could be acquired, processed and presented remotely in real-time with minimal error.|Thesis collection|virtual instumentation/meteorological variables/transducers/sensors/ multithreading/remote measurement*||||||Idowu, Mary Kemi|F|The Effects of Sodium and Potassium on Growth, Yield, Nutrient Content and Nutritional Quality of Tomato (Lycopersicon lycopersicum (L. ) Karst ) ||||||Ph.

Karst), with aview to establishing the optimal levels of Na and K that would promote good growth and yield of tomato.It also examined an appropriate Na : K ratio that might be required in fertilizer formulationto enhance and sustain the growth of the tomato plant. The greenhouse study was a 6 x 4 factorial, arranged into a randomized complete block design(RCBD) and replicated three times. Sodium at 0, 2, 4, 8, 16and 32 mg Na kg-1soil and K at 0, 32, 64 and 128 mg K kg-1soil were applied as NaCI and KCI, respectively. In the field, Na and K treatments were based on the results obtained for greenhouse study.There were four levels of Na and three levels of K, arranged in a RCBD and replicated three times. Records of the number of leaves, branches, flowers and fruits yields were taken. The dry matter yield, water and nutrient contents of tomato plants were determined. Citric acid and water content, pH and electrical conductivity of the fruit juice were also determined.Results of the greenhouse study indicated that fruit yield, shoot-N and -Ca, and citric acid contents of the fruit juice improved significantly at 2 to 4 mg Na kg-1soil but decreased at 16 to 32 mg Na kg-1soil (p < 0.05). The sodium concentration of the tomato plant was markedly increased at increasing levels of sodium application without an adverse effect on growth. The addition of Na up to 4 mg kg-1soil to K up to 64 mg kg-1soil produced optimal leaf and fruit yields,plant water content, and citric acid content of fruit juice. However, it was observed that at 32 mg Na kg-1soil, the addition of 128 mg K kg-1soil reduced the depressing effect of high K at 128 mg kg-l soil on the growth.The number of leaves correlated positively with soil-Na (r = 0.51, P < 0.05) but negatively with soil-K (r = -0.07, P< 0.05) while the ftuit yields correlated positively with the number of leaves (r = 0.65, P < 0.01) and citric acid content (r = 0.72, P < 0.01). In the field, the number of flowers, fruit weight and the citric acid content increased at 4 up to 16 mg Na kg-1soil and 64 mg K kg-1soil. Shoot-N and -Ca, root-P and -Mg, and fruit-K were also increased significantly at the above stated Na and K levels. Fruit weight correlated positively with the number of leaves (r = 0.92, P < 0.01), shoot/root ratio (r = 0.91, P < 0.01) and shoot-N (r = 0.78, P < 0.01).The study concluded that Na is necessary for the growth of tomato. It also has a potential of playing an essential role in the nutrition of tomato plants, particuarly when combined with K at Na:K ratio of 1 : 4 up to I : 8. This role of Na could further be pronounced in seasons and areas where soil water may be limiting, as Na was observed to have played a role in water retention in thevegetative growth of the plant. The tomato could probably be classified as a medium Na-tolerant plant. |Thesis collection| Tomato(Lycopersicon lycopersicum (L. ) Karst ) /soil water/Na-tolerant plant/fruit juice/ greenhouse/dry matter yield/citrc acid content*||||||kolawole, Taiwo Olabode|M|Adoption and use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in Selected Manufacturing Industries in the City of Ibadan||||||M.

Data were collected at two levels, the firm level and the workers level. Four firms that had adopted ICT were selected for the study. These firms were grouped into two categories (i) ICT Intensive users (Wide Area Network firms) and (ii) non-Networked (local area network) firms. 336 non-management workers out of 1268 were selected in all the four firms surveyed using the quota sampling technique. All the heads of units (20) were interviewed, the quantitative data were analysed using descriptive and inferentialstatistics while the qualitative data were analysed using Text Base Beta. Findings were presented using the ZY Index Tables.The study showed that the workers generally had positive attitude to the adoption and use of ICT though the facilities available in these industries were mainly used for administrative functions and data processing. Irrespective of the level of ICT adoption and use across firms, it had implications for the organisational structure and functions, work processes, work performance and overall productivity. Data from ICT intensive users showed a significant relationship between ICT use and the following variables (i) organisational structure and functions (X2=1.441, df =2, P-Value =0.001), (ii) work processes (X2= . 551, df = 2, P-Value = 0.001), (iii) work performance (X2=11.739, df = 2, P-Value = 0.003) and (iv) overall productivity (X2=1. 542, df =I, P-Value = 0.001). Within the Non-networked ICT firms which comprises of Askar Paint Ltd (APL) and Niger Match Ltd (NML), there were no significant relationships between ICT use, and organizational structure, and functions (X2=. 517, df =I, P-Value=0.472) and overall productivity (X2= 0.001, df =l, P-Value = 1.000. This is because these two firms have the same level of ICT facilities. However data analysis showed significant relationships between ICT use and work processes and performance within the Non Networked firms (X2=74.468, df =2, P-Value = 0.001) and (X2=43.606, df =2, P-Value = 0.001)respectively.The findings in the Non-networked firms were as a result of relatively low ICT facilities and low capital investment on ICT facilities.The study concluded that the adoption and use of ICT facilities in manufacturing industries enhanced effective intra and inters organisational communication and also improved organisational functions depending on the amount of capital invested on the ICT facilities. However, low capital investment poor supply of electricity, high cost of ICT facilities and maintenance limited the optional effect of the adoption and use of ICT facilities in the selected manufacturing industries.|Thesis collection|ICT adoption/Text Base Beta/local area network/ICT facilities and maintenance/wide area network/ICT intensive users*||||||Kolawole, Abiodun Basiru|M|Critically in the Heat Balance Equation with Variable Pre-Exponential Factor||||||M.

The equation was used to obtain the critical Frank- Kamenetskii parameter dcr and the maximum temperature, qm,cr for fixed values of e under physically reasonable boundary conditions. For the case of constant pre-exponential factor, the determination of the exact solution for the simple nonlinear equation was nontrivial. In addition, the case of variable pre-exponential, the nonlinear ordinary differential equation can be integrated once to obtain a nonlinear first order differential equation. The resulting equation was solved numerically for various values of initial nondimensionalized temperature qo at the inner wall. In the special case of constant pre-exponential factor explicit values for dcr , qo,cr, qm,cr under the various boundary conditions were obtained. In the event that there was variable pre-exponential factor, the results were  presented graphically and tabularly for only three boundary conditions. One striking feature in the case of constant pre-exponential factor was that these parameters were the same when the inner slab was thermally insulated and the outer was isothermal and vice-versa. The major observations for variable pre-exponential factor were that dcr was a concave function of  qo while  qm,cr  was monotonically increasing. In conclusion, this study showed that the values of  dcr and  qm,cr were determined using various values of  qo (-1, 0, 1) under variable pre-exponential (e ¹ 0 )|Thesis collection|pre-exponential/ concave function/ heat balance equation/differential equation/slab arising/thermally insulated. *||||||Sule, Salami Suberu|M|Primary Health Care Service Utilization in Imesi-Ile, Osun state, Nigeria||||||M.

The study employed a descriptive design utilizing both quantitative and qualitative methods. The qualitative method used included participant observation, in-depth interview and review of hospital records. For the quantitative aspect of the study, 90 households were selected using cluster-sampling technique. Data were collected using in-depth interviewer's guide and interviewer-administered questionnaires. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.The results showed that 70% of the respondents often utilized the services of the PHC facilities located in the community. However, only 45% of the household respondents who were ill in the six months preceding the survey visited a PHC facility for treatment. The most important services/service factors that attracted respondents to use PHC services included maternal and child health care(47.1%), outpatient care (21.4%) and prompt attention with good treatment (24.3%). Educational attainment was the only socio-demographic variable that positively influenced the utilization pattern of PHC services (P<0.05). While almost all respondents interviewed expressed some degree of satisfaction with the services rendered at the Rural Comprehensive Health Centre (RCHC), both thekey informantsand the survey respondents identified some barriers to utilization of services at the PHC facilities in the community. These included widespread poverty, perceived high cost of health care services and absence of a regular physician in the facility. Others included lack of laboratory services, the "out of stock syndrome" in the pharmacy, the referral policy at the RCHC and the availability of alternative health care practitioners.The study concluded that utilization of PHC services was high in the community not withstanding the identified barriers to effective utilization.|Thesis collection|primary health care/referral policy/laboratory services/rural comprehensive health centre/client's variables*||||||Ilori Olasupo John|M|Allelopathic Effects of Tithonia diversifolia ( Hemsl ) A.

Gray, compare the phytotoxicity of the plant parts of T. diversifolia and determine the effect of drying on the phytotoxic activity of this weed.The effects of the aqueous extracts prepared from the shoots and roots of T. diversifolia on Amaranthus cruentus and Oryza sativa were obtained by subjecting the seedlings to the different aqueous extract treatments. Germination studies were carried out by raising seedlings on Whatman No I filter paper lining petri dishes each moistened with 10 ml of appropriate aqueous extract. The emergence of 1 mm of the radicle was used as the criterion for germination. Potted seedlings were separated into five different treatment regimes namely control regime, fresh shoot aqueous extract (FSE), dry shoot aqueous extract (DSE), fresh root aqueous extract (FRE) and dry root aqueous extract (DRE) regimes and used for the growth parameters, chlorophyll and total protein contentanalyses. The pots were arranged in a completely randomized design in five replicates. Each pot was supplied with 400 ml of the appropriate aqueous extract on a daily basis. Harvesting started at two weeks and continued thereafter on a weekly basis for six weeks. Chlorophyll content was determined by extracting samples of shoot in 80 % (v/v) acetone. Absorbance of the extracts were determined at 647 nm and 664 nm wavelength using an M 201 Cam Spec visible spectrophotometer. Ground samples of seedling shoots were extracted in phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and then the protein content of the extract was determined using the Lowry technique. Data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOYA) and least significant difference (LSD P < 0.05).Results showed that the germination, growth parameters, chlorophyll content and total protein content of Amaranthus cruentus and Oryza sativa were retarded by all the four different aqueous extracts applied except germination of Oryza sativa which was not affected. The retardation was more pronounced in older plants. The degree of retardatory effects of the aqueous extracts were found to follow this order: FSE > DSE > FRE > DRE. There was a significantly higher phytotoxic potency at p < 0.05 in the fresh tissue aqueous extract compared with the dry tissue aqueous extract as well as in the shoot aqueous extract compared to the root aqueous extract.This study concluded that Tithonia diversifolia was an allelopathic weed with water-soluble allelochemicals in its plant parts and had such phytotoxic potency that could suppress the growth and nutrient accumulation of associated crop plants.|Thesis collection|Oryza sativa Linn./spectrophotometer/phytotoxic potency/allelopathic weed/lowry technique/allelochemicals/aqueous extract *||||||Mukoro, Ufuomaoghene Jemima|F|An Assessment of Nursing Care of Hospitalized Elderly Persons in Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Osun State, Nigeria.  ||||||M.

A self-developed interviewer-administered questionnaire and observational checklist were used for data collection. The first part of the questionnaire generated data on the demographic characteristics of the respondents. The second part obtained responses on perceived nursing care needs and actual care received by respondents. The observational checklist obtained information on the approach to care employed, frequency of nursing care received and whether or not respondents were satisfied with the care. The questionnaire was tested for content and face validity and reliability. A test-retest reliability assessmentconducted gave a correlation coefficient of 0.74. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods.The results showed that the age of respondents ranged from 65-95years, with a mean of  74-±10.1 years.A steady decline in the number of respondents was observed as age increased. Fifty-four percent of respondents were not literate and there was a steady decline in number of respondents as educational status increased. It was observed that the higher the level of education the better the care received (x2 = 10.789, P = 0.001). Eighty-five percent of the respondents actually received care and of these 60% had their needs provided for by informal caregivers. The perceived nursing care needs included grooming, mobility, elimination of waste products, medication and other special care needs such as care of pressure areas and wound dressing. There were greater expectations among males than females (P< 0.05) for these needs, with the exception of some aspects of grooming such as hair care -[x2 = 3.384, p>0.05], manicure/pedicure [x2 = 0.458, p>0.05], and dressing up x2 = 0.370, p>0.05] which were not significantly different between gender, contrary to expectations. There was considerable irregularity in the provision of nursing care, particularly in the medical and orthopaedic wards. A task-oriented approach to care instead of.holistic care was employed by nurses in all the selected wards.The study concluded that the majority of geriatric patients had their perceived nursing care needs provided for by informal caregivers instead of nurses whose approach to nursing care was below minimum standard in some areas.|Thesis collection|geriatric patients/gynaecological/renal wards/caregivers/Wesley Guide Hospital/orthopaedic wards*||||||Ninan, Deborah Olufemi|F|Interfacing 3D Virtual Worlds Using JAVA Programming Language||||||M.

The 2D interface was then converted to a 3D visualization interface using Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML). Each of the objects within the map of OAU was also converted to 3D using the VRML. The database to store the 3D objects was developed using Microsoft Access XP version software. The interface was tested using CosmoPlayer (VRML Browser), Web browser, Internet Information System (IIS) through an 8 port hub.It was possible for several clients to view and access the map and each of the objects in real time. The results of the viewed 3D objects showed that it was not only possible to describe the shape of 3D information, but also to describe the interactive behaviours to be applied when a user encounters information and attempts to interact with it.In conclusion, the proposed architecture comprised the following modules: client module, server module and a 3D database.

This was achieved through the pyrolysis of the precursors - cobalt and lithium cobalt acetylacetonates at 420 °c and 350 °c respectively with a flow rate of 2.5 dm3/min for a period of one hour. The characterization of theprecursors was done using infrared spectrophotometer and it showed the presence of organic ligands.The composition, stoichiometry and thickness of the prepared thin films of cobalt oxide and lithium cobalt oxide were determined by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) technique. The optical characterization was carried out using ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer.The results showed that the stoichiometry and thickness of cobalt oxide thin film are given as Co2O3and 227 nm respectively, while Li - Co - O thin film had a thickness of 20 nm. The films showed a strong absorption band in the uv-region. Direct band gaps of 2.15 eV and 1.87 eV were obtained from the prepared thin films of cobalt oxide and lithium cobalt oxide respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed the micrographs of thin films of Co2O3 at various magnifications to be pinhole free with grain size less than 1.0 micron, while the Li - Co -O micrograph was not pinhole free and the grain size ranged between 0.7 - 9.0 microns.The deposition of thin films cobalt oxide and lithium cobalt oxide from single solid source precursors confirms the suitability of  MOCVD technique for thin film deposition.|Thesis collection|cobalt oxide/stoichiometry/uv-region/scanning electron microscopy/electronic industry/acetylacetonate*|||||| Koya, Alice Olapeju |F|Determinants of Basic Knowledge of Integrated Science Among Pre-Service Teachers in Colleges of Education in Southwestern Nigeria.||||||M.A. ED (Curriculum Studies)       |Dibu-Ojerinde, O.

It also identified the areas of deficiency in the basic concepts of Integrated Science in order to provide guidelines that would improve the proficiency of pre-service teachers.An ex-post facto design was employed in carrying out the study. Pre-service teachers in year two from four institutions in Southwestern Nigeria constituted the population, out of which 200 pre-service teachers were randomly selected for the purpose of the study. The subjects were tested by administering objective test items on the selected concepts in Integrated Science such as, air pressure, energy, motion, state of matter, ecology, electricity, irritability and food storage. The reliability coefficient of the validated test instrument used was r = 0.67. Statistics employed in the analysis of observed data included the use of Pearson Product Moment Correlation, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and t-test statistic.The study showed that there was a significant difference in the performance of the subjects in the different concepts with the highest rating in matter and the least in motion. Overall, 51.6% of the subjects were deficient in the tested concepts, 16.0% had sound understanding and 32.4% had satisfactory understanding. A fairly strong correlation existed between their performance and entry academic performance (r = 0.46, significant at 0.01 level). Furthermore, performance of the subjects with prior professional training was significantly different compared with subjects without prior professional training (t = 10.27 at p < 0.05). However, performance of the subjects was not dependent on either age or sex (mean score difference of 0.17% with p > 0.05).The study concluded by providing useful guidelines for selection, training and curriculum development for pre-service teachers.|Thesis collection|Integrated Science/pre-service teachers/air pressure/professional training/Southwestern/irritability*||||||Lalude, Lawuyi Oyeniyi|M|Development and Nutritional Assessment of A Weaning Food From Sorghum and Oil Seeds||||||M.

Analyses carried out on the complementary diet included physico  chemical, protein, fat, moisture, minerals and calorie contents. Bioassay was also carried out and the results were then compared with a commercial complementary diet.The proximate analysis showed 19.97% protein,66.58% carbohydrate, 9.87%fat and 1846.7 kJ for formulated diet as compared to 16% protein, 63.7% carbohydrate,9.0% fat and 1670kJ for the commercial diet.The formulated diet also had values of 0.66 ± 0.02 bulk density,4.87± 0.10 swelling capacity and 0.44 ± 0.14 water holding capacity as compared with 0.61 ± 0.16 bulk density, 3.64 ± 0.18 swelling capacity and 0.41 ± 0.10 water holding capacity of formulated diet. Viscosity at 40% concentration of formulated diet was found to correspond to 20% of the commercial weaning diet, at 30°C. Thus more of formulated diet will go into the solution thereby providing more calorie and protein at the same viscosity. The animal feeding experiment further showed the Protein Efficiency Ratio(PER) to be 3.16 ± 0.11 and Food Efficiency Ratio(FER)to be 0.63± 0.12 for the formulated diet as compared to PER 2.22 ± 0.12 and FER 0.44 ± 0.03 for commercial diet. These results showed significant differences (P<0.05) between the formulated and the commercial diets. The formulated diet showed higher qualities.It was thus concluded that the formulated diet would ameliorate Protein  Energy Malnutrition (PEM) in infants during the weaning period.|Thesis collection|germinated sorghum/micronutrients content/weaning period/bioassay/commercial diet/formulated diet/shelf life*||||||Momoh John Akhagbeme|M|Development of an Interference Reduction Technique in Code Division Multiple Access ||||||M.Sc.

The work also used logical decision method in designing Hard Decision (HD) circuit for a given value of q, which was used in cancelling the interference effect when these q FH patterns are used in FH-CDMA systems. Furthermore, a designed single-user detection scheme based on reducing interference in Multilevel Frequency Shift Keying / Fast Frequency Hopping - Code Division Multiple Access (MFSK/FFH-CDMA) system using a technically partitioned spectrum was introduced. C language programs were used for the generation of the FH patterns while computer electronic simulation was used for designing and testing of both the HD circuit and the single-user detection scheme.The result show that the family of FH patterns had zero out-of-phase autocorrelation value in both synchronous and asynchronous modes. It also showed zero crosscorrelation value in synchronous mode while the crosscorrelation values range from zero to a maximum of the quotient of q/3 if q is a multiple of three or to a maximum of the quotient of (q + 5)/3 for any other value of q in asynchronous mode. The results further showed that the HD circuit had capability in correcting bit errors that could result from interference in an MFSK/FFH-CDMA system thereby minimizing the bit error rate of the introduced single-user detection scheme.In conclusion, the good correlation properties of these FH patterns in synchronous and asynchronous modes and their existence for all values of q greater than four made them suitable for use in many FH-CDMA communication systems employing single-user or multi-user detection scheme.|Thesis collection|asynchronous mode/crosscorrelation/single-user/algebraic algorithm/multi-user detection scheme/FH patterns     *||||||Lamidi, Wasiu Agunbiade |M|Effects of Floor Space and Stocking Density on Broiler Production in Nigeria.||||||M.Sc.

Also, the effects of stocking density on broiler productivity was assessed by housing 4, 6, 8 and 10 birds, in pens of floor areas, 2800 cm2, 4200 cm2, 5600 cm2, and 7000 cm2 respectively. In both cases, there were three replicates for each experiment. The birds' feed intake and the weight gains per bird were recorded weekly for the calculation of weekly feed conversion ratio. Proximate analysis was carried out on carcasses of birds from each of the pen for meat quality assessment. The litter properties such as temperature, pH, density, moisture content and relativehumidity of the floor space were also measured using standard methods.The study showed that the effects of floor space and stocking density on carcass yield and quality of the broilers were significant at 0.05 level ranging from 1.50 kg in 2800cm2 pen to 1.20 kg in 7000 cm2 pen. The highest broilers' carcass yield of 1.50 kg was obtained in one of four birds reared in 2800 cm2 floor area with the range of 1.20 kg to 1.50kg in the whole experiment. The highest mean value and the lowest standard deviation of 1.496 kg and 0.71 of final weight of birds per pen respectively were obtained in 2800 cm2 floor area. This same floor area showed consistent increase in weekly weight gains over the study period of two months.In conclusion, a floor space of 700 cm2 / bird was the optimum for enhanced productivity in broiler house design.|Thesis collection|broiler's carcass/floor space/stocking density/weight gains/broiler house design/bird's feed intake*||||||Komolafe, Amos Omoniyi|M|An Investigation on the Incidence of  Bacterial Septicaemia in Ile-Ife, Nigeria.||||||M.

They all had clinical features suggestive of septicaemia and were on admission at the Obafemi Awolowo University Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Their blood specimens were seeded into thioglycollate and glucose broths and incubated at 37°C for 7 days. Subcultures were performed after 1,2,3,4 and 7 days respectively. Growth (positivity) in the broths was assessed using conventional diagnostic methods namely macroscopy (visualization), Gram filming (microscopy) and culture. The bacterial isolates harvested were subjected to in-vitro antibiotic susceptibility tests using the disc diffusion method.Aetiology was established in 204 out of 650 subjects indicating an incidence of 31.4%. Children below 10 years (18.1%), especially the neonates were more vulnerable than adults (21-70+ years, 13.3%). This difference in prevalence among different age groups was statistically significant (P<0.01). The males (112/650, 17.2%) appeared be more susceptible to septicaemia than the females (94/650, 14.5%) in all the age groups, this variation had no statistical significance (P>0.01). The prevalence of neonatal septicaemia peaked (78.8%) in the first week of life. In culture-proven septicaemia, Gram positive bacteria (53.0%) had higher prevalence than Gram negative bacteria (45.5%). The bacterial pathogens isolated were diverse but Staphylococcus aureus occurred predominantly (43.6%), followed by Klebsiella sp. (17.1%), Escherichia coli (9.8%), coagulase negative Staphylococci (7.8%) and Pseudomonas sp. (6.9%). Monomicrobial septicaemia had a higher prevalence (92.2%) than polymicrobial septicaemia (7.8%). In cases of polymicrobial septicaemia, a combination (association) of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria had the highest occurrence (14/16, 87.5%) in which Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli constituted 43.8%. Most of the offensive microbes were facultative anaerobes (91.7%) while very few were strict aerobes (6.8%) and strict anaerobes (1.5%). The isolated anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (0.5%) and Bacterioides fragilis (1%). The use of thioglycollate broth had a higher success rate (comparative efficiency of 31.4%) over the glucose broth (28.8%). Sub-cultures of blood seeded thioglycolate broths performed after 1,2,4 and 7 days had yield rates of 68%, 87%, 100% and 100% respectively. Of the three conventional diagnostic methods, culture (31.4%) appeared to be marginally most sensitive and efficient detector, followed by Gram-filming (25.4%) and macroscopy (21.2%). The in vitro susceptibility of the bacterial isolates to antibiotics indicated 76.4 - 95.6% sensitivity to vancomycin, zinnat, peflacin and fortum. However, they were 60-90% resistant to penicillin, ampicilin, tetracycline and septrin.In conclusion, this study confirmed the diverse nature of bacterial aetiologies of septicaemia.|Thesis collection|septicaemia/aetiology/facultative anaerobes/thioglycollate broths/Gram-filming/ polymicrobial *||||||Kumolalo, Franklin Oladiipo|M|Development of An Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) Service-Metering System||||||M.

These parameters are Peak Cell Rate (PCR), Sustainable Cell Rate (SCR), and Maximum Burst Size (MBS). Two hundred and eighty six (286) runs of computer simulation for network traffic of a VBR rt connection were carried out using a model developed from chaotic map function for source cell generation, and conservative timed Petri net for policing function. Bandwidth utilization, taken as average utilization rate (AUR) (cells/s) over a period, were measured against varying values of PCR, SCR, and MBS. In the simulation, two parameters were held constant while the remaining was varied.The results showed that changes in value of PCR by 10,000 cells/s changed AUR by 3 cells/s; showing that changes in PCR had very little effect upon the instantaneous value of AUR. In addition a change of 10,000 cells/s in SCR caused a variation of between 9920cells/s to 10,330 cells/s in AUR; this one to one effect of change in SCR showed that the SCR was the significant parameter in the determination of AUR. The last parameter, MBS, did not produce any noticeable effect upon the value of AUR. Thus for a particular combination of PCR, SCR and MBS, the parameter that decides the AUR was the SCR.It was concluded that AUR was a function of SCR, and that SCR was a reliable yardstick for metering ATM VBR rt connection.|Thesis collection|peak cell rate/maximum burst size/sustainable cell rate/ Asynchronous Transfer Mode/fair billing scheme*||||||Kuteyi, Modupeola Olapeju|F|A Study of Interrelationships Between Maternal Health and Environment in a Refugee Settlement in Oru, Ogun State, Nigeria||||||Ph.D  Demography and Social Statistics|Omideyi, A.

A total of 728 female respondents of reproductive age (15-49 years) and 708 male respondents (18-59 years) were interviewed by means of structured questionnaires. To complement the quantitative approach were four focus group discussions and three key informant interviews. Analysis of the data collected was done at three levels namely univariate, bivariate and multivariate analyses. The logistic regression model was used to test the hypothesis.Prevailing situations showed that refugee women are at risk of pregnancy and environment-related dangers which put their health and the quality of the ecological environment at risk. First, the study revealed that refugee women and their male counterparts neglected to identify, in substantial proportions, life-threatening pregnancy conditions especially in obstetric emergencies. Second, refugee women had to obtain permission (from spouses or camp authorities) before seeking emergency obstetric help at the nearest health facility which in itself was far, being about 10 kilometers away. Third, no regular or reliable means of transportation was available in such emergencies. Fourth, the study revealed that even though awareness of environmental degradation was high for both males and females (89.3%,p=0.003), nevertheless, respondents indulged in certain dangerous practices like cooking indoors (14.1%) with firewood and charcoal(p=0.005), without adequate ventilation. Fifth, their method of handling domestic waste and storage of drinking water was inappropriate (p=0.002). In addition, their handling of waste in their environment when appropriate authorities failed to do so was implemented using wrong disposal methods as 59.7% opted to burn wastes and 28.9% would rather leave wastes to decay in their immediate surroundings.This study therefore concluded that there were direct and indirect interrelationships between maternal health and the environment across age, educational attainment, pregnancy history, contraceptive use, family planning knowledge, among others, in a refugee camp. The data findings documented would serve as a guide on how to enhance the needs of refugee women, and the processes necessary for reconstructing their lives, particularly the enhancement of the quality of the environment in their immediate surroundings, preparatory to their re-integration into their home or host countries.|Thesis collection|maternal health/refugee women/pregnancy history/univariate/bivariate/maternal morbidities/refugee camp*||||||Mukoro, Akpomuvire|M|The Effects of Human Resources Training and Development on the Performance of Civil Servants in Delta State, Nigeria||||||Ph.D Public Administration|Erero, E.

It also appraised the relationship between training  and development and job performance of civil servants; examined the effects of the 1988 civil service reforms on training and development in the state, and highlighted the constraints and problems of training in the state civil service between 1991 and 2001.Primary data were collected through questionnaires administered on 300 respondents. This was based on the stratified sampling technique covering both senior and junior officers drawn  from the 19 Ministries and Extra-Ministerial Departments in the State Civil Service. The Delta State Civil Service had a total staff strength of 5,248 as at 2001. This comprised 1,289 Senior Staff and 3,959 junior officers to give a ratio of one senior staff to three junior officers. For each ministry and extra-ministerial department. four senior members of staff and 12 junior officers completed the questionnaires except in one ministry where three questionnaires were administered on senior members of staff and nine on junior workers.Computing for a confidence level of  95% by using the EPIINFO version 6- computer software package, an expected frequency of 25% and worst expected frequency of 20% was arrived at. This gave a sample size of 273. A non-response possibility of 10% was also computed to give 27, thus bringing the final sample size to 300. In addition, indepth interviews were held with the Directors of Training in the 19 ministries and extra-ministerial departments. Secondary data were extracted from books, journals, publications of the state govemment and files. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical method.The study showed that training and development has not markedly enhanced the perfonnance of civil servants. Although training and development were a standing policy, a high proportion of civil servants (60% senior and 82% junior staff), had no job schedule that spelt out their specific duties and responsibilities. They were therefore lacking in knowledge about the essence and demands of their jobs. More revealing was the fact that over 55% of senior members of staff and 88% of junior officers claimed not to have undertaken training and development. In addition, 63% of senior members of staff and 52% of junior officers did not have confidence in the adequacy of the training and development exercise carried out by the state civil service. It was further revealed that although civil servants preferred to attend seminars/workshops (84% for both senior and junior staff), an examination of the number of trainees sent for specific programmes between 1991 and 2001 showed that while seminars/workshops accounted for 36% between 1991 and 1995, diploma/certificates and graduate programmes accounted for 26% between 1996and 1999,and 35% for 2000 and 2001 respectively.The 1988 civil service reforms which stressed training and re-training of all staff notwithstanding, 69% of senior members of staff and 66% of junior officers claimed not to have undertaken training for them to become professionals.The study concluded that the manpower training policies in the Delta State Civil  Service are imperfectly being carried out and would not facilitate the acquisition of the relevant skills and knowledge. The process of planning for training and development programmes, the pattern of implementation and the trend that training had taken over the years were defective and therefore left much to be desired.|Thesis collection|civil servants/extra-miniterial departments/*||||||Ogunlusi, Grace  Olufunmilayo|F|Ion - Pair Formation In The Outer  Sphere Electron Transfer Reactions Between Tris- (1, 10) Phenanthroline Iron (II) And The Halopentacyanocobaltate (III)  Complexes In Aqueous Acidic Solutions.||||||M.

The kinetics of the reactions were investigated by conventional uv/vis spectrophotometer at wavelength of 510 nm. The activation parameters were determined from a variation of the rate constants with temperature, using the Arrhenius equation and the corresponding equation from the absolute rate theory. The specific rate constants were obtained from the slope of pseudo-first order plots of the In (absorbance) vs time.The results showed that the reactions approached saturation at concentrations beyond 30 fold excess for Co(CN)5C13 and beyond 50 fold excess for both Co(CN)5Br3 and Co(CN)5I3. The reactions showed no significant acid dependence in the range of [H+] = 0.001- 0.060 mol dm-3 for these systems. Second order rate constants obtained for these systems at 25°C were within the range of (0.151  1.117) dm3  mol1s1. Activation parameters measured for these systems were as follows: change in enthalpy of activation, DH* (kJ K1 mol1') = 94.3 ± 0.6, 97.3 ± 1.0 and 109.1± 0.4; change in entropy of activation,  DS* (J K1 )= 69.1 ± 1.9, 74.9 ± 3.2 and 112.3 ± 1.3; change in free energy, DG* (kJ) = 73.7 ± 0.6, 75.0 ± 1.0 and 75.7 ± 0.4; change in activation energy, Ea (kJ) = 96.9 ± 0.3, 99.8 ± 0.4, and 122.9 ± 0.3; A-factor, A (dm3 mol1s1) = (7.079 ± 0.035) x 1016,(1.413 ± 0.011) x 1017,and (9.772 ±  0.027) x 1020 for X = Cl, Br, and I respectively. The values of the product of charges obtained from the ionic strength dependence study were 1.79 ± 0.18, 1.65 ± 0.18 and 1.81 ± 0.10 for X = CI, Br and I respectively. The rate law obtained was consistent with the observed protonation of the cobalt(III) oxidants, and the ionic strength data. The protonation constants Ka (dm6 mo12) obtained in the acid concentration range 0.0001 0.06 mol dm-3 were 1.22 x 103, 7.31 x 1030 and 9.90 x 102  for X = Cl, Br and I respectively. Ion-pair constants Kip (mol-1 dm-3) were 5.19 x 104, 3.00 x 102 and 4.02 x 104 for X = Cl, Br and I respectively.The work concluded that the electron transfer processes go by the outer-sphere mechanism in which the transition state is an ion-pair.

The comparison between the levels of these heavy metals in the listed media from mining and non-mining sites were made using t-test and by determining their enrichment factors.The mean concentration of the following heavy metals in soil samples were: Fe (4702 mg / kg), Mn (1001 mg / kg), Co (50 mg / kg), As (43 mg / kg) and Pb (1434 mg / kg) while in non-mining site were: Fe (723 mg / kg), Mn (38 mg / kg), Co (9 mg / kg) and Pb (130 mg / kg). For plant samples, the mean concentration of these heavy metals were: Fe (1475 mg / kg), Mn (183 mg / kg), As (15 mg / kg) and Pb (45 mg / kg) in mining sites while in non mining site were: Fe (875 mg / kg), Mn (6 mg / kg) and Pb (2 mg / kg). For mining site water samples, the mean concentration were: Fe (23.7 mg / L), Mn (1.1 mg / L), As (0.2 mg / L), Pb (3.9 mg / L) and Co (0.2 mg / L) compared with  Fe (0.9 mg / L), Mn (0.8 mg / L) and Co (0.09 mg / L) for non-mining site water samples, while some were below the detection limits. The good agreement between the certified and experimental values of analytes in certified reference materials analyzed together with our samples indicated the reliability of the analytical method used.It has been established in this work that both soil and plant samples from the mining sites were significantly enriched in As, Mn and Pb compared with identical samples from the non-mining site. The heavy metals As, Fe, Mn and Pb were present in high concentration and above the normal or recommended limits in river samples collected from the three mining sites. The concentration of these four elements in drinking water of communities near the mining sites were also found to be above FEPA's maximum permissible limits for water used for drinking and domestic purposes as well.    |Thesis collection| gold mining/multi-elemental technique/heavy metals/FEPA/analytes/detection limits      *||||||Ojemuyide, Bidemi Bolanle|F|An Assessment Of Factors Affecting Discipline In Selected Secondary Schools In Oyo State.||||||M.

The objective was to examine the impact of such variables as school type, and school location, relative to the prevalence of indiscipline, as well as identify the most prevalent discipline problems in schools. This was done with a view to addressing the anomalous situation of indiscipline pervading many schools.The population for the study comprised school principals, the Heads of Department, and the SS1, SS2, and SS3 students of secondary schools in Oyo State. A total of one hundred and fifty (150) respondents, made up of 30 principals, 30 vice-principals, and 90 Heads of Department, formed part of the sample for the study. This was in addition to a random sample of four hundred and fifty (450) students, drawn from the 30 selected secondary schools.The research instrument used in this study was a questionnaire, divided into a number of sections, respectively addressed, to measure the administrators' perceptions and strategies to curb indiscipline, as well as the students' opinion on the prevalence of discipline problems. The instrument was tested for reliability, and had a test-retest reliability of 0.80. Data from the administration of the instrument were analyzed, using descriptive, and chi-square statistical procedures.The results of the study showed that lateness to school had the highest frequency unit 57 or (38.0 percent), while absenteeism had the lowest frequency unit of 1, or (0.07 percent). Furthermore, it was also found out that fighting among students, and rudeness to teachers had significant chi-square values of 9.84 and 8.41 respectively (p< 0.05). Furthermore, it was also found out that the type of school (Mixed or single sex, day or boarding, and private or government owned), did not significantly influence discipline problems. It was thus concluded that parents should continuously exhibit desirable and worthy example at all times, and adequately monitor the activities of their wards, as a way of redressing the problem of indiscipline in schools.|Thesis collection|indiscipline/anomalous situation/Heads of Department/discipline problems/absenteeism/vice-principals.*||||||Okedare Amos Olufemi|F|Assessment of Road Safety Practices of Commercial Motorcyclists in Ondo, Ondo State, Nigeria||||||M.

This was carried out at the nine motorcycle designated parks in the town. A non-participant observation was carried out at 10 busy junctions in different parts of the town. The motorcyclists were scored for road safety practice, riding pattern and other characteristics by using a pre-designed checklist. FGD was carried out among five motorcyclists with the aid of a discussion guide in five randomly selected zones. Data analysis was done by the use of appropriate descriptive and inferential statistics with level of significance set at 5% or less.The result revealed that the average age of the 4 I I riders interviewed was 25.7 years (range 15-50 years). They were all males and majority had formal education. A higher proportion (52%) were single, while 45% were married. The younger age groups were observed to have low safety scores and were disobeying traffic regulations (p< 0.05). Though level of education of riders did not improve their safety attitudinal score (p> 0.05), it affected their knowledge of road signs and status of their motorcycle (p< 0.05). The highly experienced riders had high safety scores and low prevalence of accident among them (p< 0.05). There was a prominent increase in the prevalence of road traffic accident due to commercial motorcyclists treated at the Ondo State Specialist Hospital (2 1% in 1994 vs 49% in 1999). The study revealed that up to 12.8% of the motorcyclists had been involved in major accident within six months prior to the time of the study. Majority (63%) of them could not identify correctly any of the five common road signs shown them at the time of interview. Only 28.5% were scored high by the investigation, who could be considered safe for their passengers and other road users. On utilisation of road safety devices, majority (54.5%) did not use any, forty five percent (45%) used face caps for protection from the sun while only 0.5% used crash safety helmet. Up to 34.5% of the motorcyclist had never seen the crash helmet. The use of other protective devices like eyes shades, hand gloves, covered shoes and other protective clothing were found to be very low.The study concluded that commercial motorcyclists in Ondo town had low consideration for road safety in their riding pattern and obedience of road signs which resulted into increased road traffic accidents.|Thesis collection|commercial motorcyclists/road traffic accidents/Specialist Hospital/road safety devices/riding pattern*||||||Ojo, Emmanuel Olatunde|M    |The History of Internal Displacement and Population Migration in Liberia (1989-1996)||||||M.Phil.

It also evaluated the roles played by ethnic armies and local warlords in the prolongation of the conflict. This was with a view to highlighting the problems of internally displaced people in the country.Primary data were collected through oral interviews with one-time internally displaced Liberians; from dairies and letters of Missionaries and members of the American Colonization Society (ACS) on the origin of the conflict between the indigenous Liberians and the Americo-Liberian settlers; from correspondences of Liberians living abroad and of the Liberian CouncilChurches; from speeches of former Liberian Presidents, and from government documents. Secondary data were sourced from biographies of Presidents William Tolbert, William Tubman, Samuel Doe and Charles Taylor; commentaries run by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Voice of America (VOA) on the Liberian crisis; handbooks on Guiding Principles on Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons; publications by International Organizations and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and the Internet. The collected data were analyzed using the descriptive method of historical research.The result showed that the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) moved from their original locations in Grand Gedeh, Grand Cape Mount, Bomi, Lower Lofa, Gbarpolu, Nimba Counties to`safe areas in and around Monrovia, such as Montserrado, Jones' Displaced Persons camps and Moulton Corner on the outskirts of Monrovia because of the presence of the Econonic Community of West African States (ECOMOG) forces in Monrovia at that time. It was revealed that a majority of the IDPs that took refuge in the approved camps in and around Monrovia (as well as those in the unapproved camps) experienced displacement  more than once as they were forced away from the designated camps in Monrovia into the interior when the city was surrounded by the forces loyal to Charles Taylor in October, 1992, and also when Prince Yormie Johnson's men unleashed a reign of terror in Monrovia in April, 1996. There was constant  internal migration from one place to another by people who did not seek refuge in the approved government camps due to ceaseless attacks by ethnic militias. The study also showed that although the internally displaced people in Liberia were numerous and faced almost identical problems and were in a more difficult and dangerous situation than refugees, yet little or nothing was done to cater for them. This was primarily because they were not qualified for the refugee status as stipulated in the Guiding Principles for Refugees of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), since they were still within the jurisdiction of their sovereign country. It was also revealed that the crisis led to various forms of impoverishment for the displaced persons, such as landlessness, economic marginalization, increased morbidity, food insecurity, loss of access to common property, and social disintegration. It also resulted in an increase in the proportion of female-headed households, an increase in the number of widows and single parents, youth unemployment and weakening of the traditional authority.  The study concluded that the long-term impacts of the conflict caused distortions of the Country's demographic structure as well as the destruction of its economic base and social infrastructures.|Thesis collection|population displacement/indigenous Liberians/Grand Gedeh/Lower Lofa/ECOMOG/Monrovia/refugee status.*||||||Ojo, Oluwayemi Adejimi|M|An Assessment of The Physico-Chemical Quality And Heavy Metal Contents of Waste Water From The Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching HospitalsComplex (OAUTHC) And Their Impacts On The Receiving Stream ||||||M.

Three stations were located each on the unimpacted and impacted sections of the receiving Elekete stream while one station each was located on the two wastewater point sources from Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex Ile-Ife. The physico-chemical parameters of water/effluent quality investigated include: oxygen parameters (dissolved oxygen, percent oxygen saturation and biochemical oxygen demand), major cations, major anions, nutrient compounds (phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, silicate and total organic carbon), physical parameters (temperature, turbidity, solids, flow velocity and discharge rates) as well as pH and conductivity. The investigated heavy metals were nickel, chromium, cadmium, lead, iron, manganese and zinc. Samples were collected from each sampling station fortnightly (and altogether 96 water and 32 effluent samples were collected over eight month period) from July 2002 - March 2003, and analysed using titrimetric, gravimetric, colorimetric, spectrophotometric and atomic absorption spectrophotometric methods. The relationship between investigated sampling stations with regard to their physico-chemical parameters and heavy metal contents were analysed using descriptive statistics, Student's ttest, linear regression and correlation analysis and cluster analysis. The Student's ttest analysis showed significant difference (P< 0.05) between the impacted and unimpacted sections of effluent receiving stream. Sample colour, turbidity, total suspended solids, total dissolved solids, total solids, conductivity, alkalinity, acidity, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, CI, HCO3¯, NO2¯ and iron were two times higher in the impacted section of the receiving stream than in the unimpacted section while SO42-, Total Organic Carbon, NH4+, PO43-, and BOD5 were more than three times higher in the impacted section than in the unimpacted section. All the investigated heavy metals and most of the physico-chemical parameters in the effluent point sources were within the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (1991) acceptable effluent quality limit for discharge into surface water. The overall mean concentrations of 293 mg l-1 and 270 mg l-1   BOD5  (biochemical oxygen demand) in the two effluent streams indicate the medium/ strong strength of the wastewater discharges from Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex  Ile-Ife.                                                             The pronounced increase in the BOD5 values of the impacted section of receiving stream indicated that the discharge from Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex Ile-Ife was mainly organic in nature.

Eight public research institutes and 30 firms were also sampled. Primary data were eventually collected from 4 universities, 7 polytechnics, 5 research institutes and 25 firms which responded to the questionnaires administered. Responses were complemented with unstructured personal interviews. Secondary data were also obtained from published sources such as the Central Bank of Nigeria, Federal Office of Statistics and World Bank. The data collected were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics.The result showed that the Federal Government's funding of Research and Development (R&D) activities was only 2.04% of recurrent grants in universities. Public research institutes were also poorly funded. Public funding of education averaged 4.28% of total government expenditure with a substantial part spent on personnel costs. The number of Science and Technology (S&T) personnel nationwide averaged 15 per million of population. Quality research personnel were concentrated in the universities with 80.71% having doctorate degrees compared with only 2.18% in polytechnics and 27.32% in public research institutes. The aggregate technological skill intensity of employees of firms was 0.07. The average GDP growth rate of the Nigerian economy was 2.4%. The average annual growth in industrial value added was 1.7%, being the lowest among all the sectors. The economy was structurally stable, with a coefficient of concordance of 0.99 significant at 1% level of significance. The economy was also internationally competitive but the manufacturing sector was less competitive. The sector also attracted the majority of credit from the financial sector but at unreasonably high interest rates. A lot of tax concessions existed but venture capital activities were low. The levels of mandate achievement among research institutes averaged 42.5%. Research facilities in educational institutions and public research institutes were in poor states but better in firms. The average levels of obsolescence of facilities was 65.5% in universities, 47.6% in polytechnics and 38.5% in research institutes. The R&D producer-user relationship was weak as firms largely used internal R&D and production departments in their technological capability building process.In conclusion, the Nigerian Innovation System was generally too weak to support sufficient technological capability building in the manufacturing sector due to factors such as low spending on R&D, low level of S&T human resources, poor state of research facilities and poor linkage between academic/research institutions and firms.|Thesis collection|manufacturing sector/Nigeria Innovation System/research institutes/public funding/polytechnics*||||||Elegbeleye, Chritianah Oluwaloni|F|Agbeyewo Itan Isele Kayeefi Yoruba Lori Redio||||||M.A. Yoruba Language and Literature|Ajuwon , B.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, African Languages and Literature |2005|||OAU|||||xiii, 186p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Thirty-two of the stories were tape recorded by the researcher during presentation of the programmes, while twenty were collected from the presenters themselves at the following radio stations: five were collected from Osun State Broadcasting Corporation (OSBC), Ita Baale, Osogbo, four from Ondo State Radio Visual Corporation (OSRC), Orita Obele, Akure, six from Broadcasting Corporation of Oyo State (BCOS), Orita Basorun, Ibadan, and the remaining five were from the Broadcasting Corporation of Oyo State (BCOS II), Oke-Mapó, Ibadan. The General Managers of the radio stations and the four presenters of the programmes were interviewed on the nature, kinds, organisation, provenance, authenticity and functions of the stories as well as sponsorship and profitability or otherwise of the programmes. Library search was also conducted to source for relevant books, periodicals and theses relating to the research. The data collected were transcribed and analysed within the theoretical framework of narratology.The investigation showed that the Yoruba amazing stories featured on the radio programme were real life experiences of members of the society and constituted a robust repertoire of the peoples' world-views and socio-cultural values. Amazing stories were narrated, using such devices as humour, digression, and suspense. It was observed that the stories transcended the borders of the ordinary everyday experience of human beings and were simply   marvelous and incredible. They were replete with strange occurrences, startling coincidences, sudden shifts, unexpected reversals of fortune, shocking violations of ethical norms and standards, diverse forms of money-making rituals, the use of magic, and the supernatural. The language used by the narrators was rich in idiomatic, epigrammatic, ironic, paradoxical and proverbial expressions. It was also characterised by repetition, descriptive epithets and similes. At times, a story was broken into three or four parts, which were arranged in chronological order. The division into parts was to make room for commercial advertisements and listeners' response and sustain their interest.The study concluded that Yoruba amazing stories on redio could be classified as part of Yoruba oral literature especially as many features of Yoruba oral genres such as proverbs, humour, puns and hyperbole were copiously found in them.|Thesis collection| "Gba-n-kogbi"/epigrammatic/proverbial expressions/Yoruba oral genres/"Tatiwere"/radio programmes.*||||||Oke, Joel Oluseye|M|Influence Of Microfinance Delivery By Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) On Rural Poverty Alleviation in Oyo and Ondo States of  SouthWestern Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Agricultural Economics|Adeyemi, R.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria.|Obafemi Awolowo University, Agricultural Economics|2005|||OAU|||||xvi, 161p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

It also investigated the factors that affected the amount of savings of rural people and the socio-economic variables that would affect repayment of loans by the people.Multi-stage stratified random sampling procedure was used to collect data from 200 Clients and 200 non-Clients of NGOs in the study area. Information was obtained on socio-demographic variables (such as age, gender, marital status, occupation and education of respondents) and socio-economic characteristics (such as income, consumption, social expenses, savings, amount of microcredit obtained and the repayment rate). The socio-economic characteristics were compared between Clients and non-Clients using the t-analysis. Poverty line (N54, 776.77 per annum) was established and used to calculate the Forster-Greeer-Thorbecke's (FGT) indices of incidence, depth and severity of poverty. Linear multiple regression was used to determine the variables that affected poverty, savings and microfinance repayment.Results of socio-economic characteristics showed that the means of years of formal education, amount of money borrowed from groups, business investment, annual savings, asset index score, annual income, consumption and social expenses were significantly higher for Clients than for non-Clients of microfinance NGOs (p < 0.01). The lending rate of the NGOs was high (42% per annum). Socio-cultural expenses of Clients were more on training and group networking which enhanced their productivity while the non-Clients spent more on ceremonies. The FGT indices showed that at annual poverty line of N54, 776.77, incidence (45.50%), depth (20.17%) and severity (10.98%) of poverty among the non-Clients were higher than among the Clients (29.50, 9.02 and 3.68% respectively). Relative poverty line among Clients was above N141.60 ($1) per day while among the non-Clients it was lower. The F-values indicated that the poverty, savings and microcredit repayment models had good fit (p < 0.01) and the Chow's test-values established significant difference in poverty and savings models between the Clients and non-Clients (p < 0.01). The study revealed that gender and poverty indicators were determinants of poverty among non-Clients but not among Clients. Socio-cultural spending was a positive and significant variable in the poverty models (p < 0.01). It also showed that belonging to the Clients' group alleviated poverty as well as enhanced savings of respondents. Access to savings facilities significantly influenced Clients' savings. The amount of group contributions and poverty indicator determined non-Clients' savings. The amount of savings was lower than business investment in the area. A trade-off was established between increasing consumption through socio-cultural expenses and reducing the amount of savings through such expenses. It was found that it paid Clients to increase such expenses whereas non-Clients were better off when they reduced them.The study concluded that in spite of high lending rate, microfinance delivery by NGOs enhanced poverty alleviation, per capita income, consumption, business investment, credit acquisition and savings among Clients.|Thesis collection|asset index score/per capital income/poverty line/Forster-Greeer-Thorbecke's indices/microfinance/credit acquisition *||||||Okorhi, Ojiyovwi Johnson|M|Assessment Of Solid Waste Management Strategies In Selected Local Government Areas Of Delta State||||||M.Sc.

Data were collected from 209 Households, 55 Environmental Health Officers, 66 Industrialists and Commercialists. Appropriate statistical methods were used to analyse the data collected.The result showed that a total of 85 types of biodegradable and non-biodegradable solid wastes were found in these LGAs. Some of these biodegradable solid wastes were food wastes (18), paper wastes (9), wood residues (8) and yard solid wastes (7). In 6 LGAs, the rate of generated food waste and paper waste were at 100%.Among the non-biodegradable solid wastes were glass wastes (7), plastic wastes (9)and metal junks (8). Urban LGAs of Ughelli North, Warri South and Uvwie generated junks at a rate 100%. Disposal pattern of crude dumping, burning and pit dumping
of solid wastes were mostly practiced in the 12 LGAs. Crude dumping in open ground was common in most localities (55%). This was followed by waste burning (42%). The methods employed in solid waste disposal polluted the components of the environment. A total of 203 (97%) household respondents agreed to the pollution of air with odour from disposed solid waste. Effluent from solid waste was moderate compared to associated smell. The waste management strategies implementation process was hindered by frequent changes in the leadership of government. Other factors that hindered the implementation of solid waste management policies by successive political system across Delta State were lack of necessary equipment for effective field operations (3.8/4) and inadequate financing of solid waste management scheme (3.7/4).The Environmental Health Officers (73%) also agreed to the non-availability of data bank for the types and volume of solid wastes generated periodically in the localities.In addition the policy instruments to promote solid waste management scheme were lacking.The study concluded that some aspects of the policies and strategy implementation on solid waste management were not adequately pursued. Among these  include the non-provision for inventory of solid wastes generated within the localities. Furthermore, the continuous pollution of components of the environment metamorphosed into health problems.|Thesis collection|biodegradable solid wastes/crude dumping/wood residues/plastic wastes/associated smell/paper wastes.*||||||Okonta, Anthony Dumebi.|M|A Study Of An Integrated Approach To The Adoption Of Solar Photovoltaic Water Pumping Technology In Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Technology Management|Akinwumi, I.

The first set of questionnaires was administered on 25 experts including engineers, technicians, hydro-geologists and researchers to elicit information on design, installation and operating conditions of existing PVP systems. The second set of questionnaires was administered on 22 respondents including individuals, government officials and Aid Agencies to elicit information on how costs and government policies affect the adoption of PVP technology. The third set of questionnaires was administered on 14 manufacturers' representatives to elicit information on business activities in the PVP sub-sector. The fourth set of questionnaires was administered on 32 Research and Development (R & D) officers to obtain information on how the adoption of PVP technology can be achieved. The guided interview was conducted on 50 respondents to obtain information on the socio-economic, institutional and environmental impact of PVP technology from the beneficiaries of PVP technology. The data on the number, location and dates of installation of the PVP systems were obtained from 36 respondents including contractors and owners of PVP systems. The data obtained were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.The results showed that about 600 PVP systems were installed in Nigeria up to January 2004. The Federal Government and its agencies installed 53.5%; State Governments and their agencies installed 36.8%; private organizations and individuals installed 9.6% of the systems. It was found that the major factors affecting technical performance of PVP systems in Nigeria included mismatching of system components, use of inexperienced technical personnel and use of inaccurate design data. The study found that in Nigeria, the mean module power used in the PVP systems was 1.564kWp and mean borehole depth was 5I.3m. A significant relationship (r = 0.604, P < 0.05) was found to exist between module power and borehole depth. High initial investment cost had hindered the rate of adoption of the system and the two most expensive system components were the modules per system and borehole which together accounted for 61.0% of total initial investment cost. None of the firms involved in PVP business enjoyed any form of subsidy or rebate because they were not involved in the manufacturing of systems or components. Majority (94.0%) of the respondents expressed dissatisfaction with the quantity of water supplied by existing systems in Nigeria. There was no noticeable environmental pollution in the various locations. The benefiting communities were economically empowered directly and indirectly through savings made from non-payment of water supply charges and reduced expenditure on drugs and other medications for curing water related diseases.In conclusion, solar photovoltaic water pumping technology had not been widely adopted in Nigeria. Consequently, the framework developed to improve the adoption rate include funding R & D in PVP technology, training of local technicians to operate, repair and maintain PVP systems, encouraging community participation in PVP project conceptualization and execution.|Thesis collection|borehole depth/hydro-geologists/solar photovoltaic/system components/local technicians*||||||Odejobi, Oludare Johnson|M|Optimization Of Heat Exchanger Network In The Crude Distillation Unit Of Kaduna Refinery And Petrochemical Company||||||M.Sc.

This is with a view to achieving considerable energy saving in the system.Data used for the analysis were extracted from the process design flowsheet and operation datasheet. The process streams were specified to determine the temperature ranges of the streams. HERO, Pinch Technology Application Software, was used to determine the utility requirements and the pinch location for specified ¢Tmin   (Minimum Temperature Difference between the streams). The software was also used for predesigned optimization of the unit. The pre-design optimization was based on the minimum number of the heat exchanger units. Maximum Energy Recovery (MER) and Evolutionary Designs at pre-design optimum  ¢Tmin were evaluated based on the payback period to select the design for post-design optimization. The post-design optimization, which was  the most important in this study, was based on the actual number of the heat exchanger units. Logarithmic Mean Temperature Difference ( ¢TIm) between the streams and the heat load on the heat exchanger with estimated value of 200Wm2K for the overall heat transfer coefficient were used to determine the heat exchanger area. The capital and energy costs were determined using the annualized cost equations.The study showed that the pre-design optimum  ¢Tmin  was 20°C and the post design optimum  ¢Tmin was 25°C. The minimum heating requirements for the MER design, First Evolutionary (FE) Design and Second Evolutionary (SE) Design were 27.08MW, 29.37MW and 30.14MW, respectively. Compared with the existing design the capital cost implications for the MER design, FE design and SE design were N139,473,531.00,  N69,627,729.00 and N59,808,997.00 respectively and the energy savings for MER design, FE design and SE design were N91,292,804.00/yr, N55,970,286.00/yr and N43,552,569.00/yr, respectively. The payback periods for the MER design, FE design and SE design were 1.53 yrs, 1.24 yrs and 1.37 years, respectively. The best design was the first evolutionary design with the least payback period of 1.24 years.The study concluded that the investigated network could be made more efficient in terms of energy saving and that the best design for application was the first Evolutionary (FE) Design since it had the shortest payback period for the energy saving achieved.   |Thesis collection|crude distillation unit/first evolutionary/maximum energy recovery/payback period/heat exchanger*||||||Odebunmi, Jerome Agboola|M|Cognitive Science And The Theories of Epistemic Justification. ||||||M.

The possibility of a theory of knowledge through scientific explanation of human natural cognitive endowments as an information processing system was also examined.The methodology employed was textual interpretations of books and journals, as well as critical and conceptual analysis of key concepts in Epistemology and Cognitive Science. Current and influential secondary texts from books and journals were extensively used in the articulation and assessment of themes on Naturalized Epistemology and Cognitive Science.The result showed that the goal of epistemology to demonstrate the possibility of knowledge necessitated the need for normative criteria. Without these normative criteria, knowledge cannot be attained. In this wise, the traditional epistemologists were right in acknowledging problems pertaining to human cognitive deficiencies. This made epistemic skepticism more challenging. The study also found out that science has both descriptive and normative tenets. These tenets are embedded in the empirical method of testing as well as in scientific laws for appraisal and evaluation of claims.Finally, the study identified information theory of knowledge as a rival to the traditional theories of epistemic justification like foundationalism, coherentism and contextualism.The study concluded that a theory of knowledge that is not amenable to scientific laws and findings in its formation could not be adequate. In this regard, cognitive science and its emphasis on scientific information processing, as a theory of knowledge, appeared to be more promising than the traditional speculative epistemology.|Thesis collection|cognitive science/contextualism/epistemology/normative criteria/epistemic skepticism*||||||Oladotun, Oladimeji Oladapo|M|A Study Of  Strategic Urban Planning In Ojoo And Sasa, Ibadan, Southwestern Nigeria.||||||M.Sc.

The study areas were Ojoo and Sasa in Ibadan, southwestern region of Nigeria. The objectives were to analyze the growth pattern in these areas between 1986 and 2002, and develop a conceptual model and planning scenario for controlling the growth of settlements in these areas.Three satellite imageries of Ibadan region were collected for analysis. The 1986 SPOT-XS, 1996 SPOT-P and 2002 IKONOS imageries of Ibadan were used for the study, all at scale 1:150 000. From these, sub-scenes of the areas selected for study were extracted using Corel Draw, Version 10 software. The extracted portion were then subjected to digital image processing and post classification change detection using PC-based Integrated Land and Water Information System (ILWIS 3.0, Academic Version). Non spatial data were collected using a set of structured questionnaire administered to 170 respondents, mainly the residents. Descriptive statistical techniques was used to analyse the data, using the Statistical Package for Social Scientist (SPSS, Version 10).The study revealed that there had been a rapid growth in the built-up areas of Ojoo and Sasa between 1986 and 2002. The built-up area had increased from 191.38 hectares in 1986 to 381.18 in 2002, representing approximately 100% increment. The average yearly growth rates between 1986 and 2002 was 11.92 hectares per year while it averaged 24.70 hectares between 1996 and 2002. Urban to peri-urban migration accounted for 84% of population growth in the area, induced primarily by availability of relatively cheap land and rental apartments.Infrastructure like roads, waste disposal and sanitation facilities were inadequate. Pipe-borne water supply was generally unavailable. Developments were noticed to be sprawling,diminishing the agricultural land. Therefore, planning interventions were considered necessary. Controlled and uncontrolled development scenarios were simulated to show the effect of the proposed intervention strategy which reduced the yearly rate of growth from 24.70 hectares to 15.61 hectares per year, ensuring sustainable development of these peri-urban areas.The study concluded that the pattern and rate of growth was unsustainable, even from the point of view of infrastructure available to the population.|Thesis collection|strategic urban planning/version 10 software/Water Information System/peri-urban/spatial growth patterns

Oriki music is part of the whole body of traditional Yoruba music, the majority of which was anonymously composed and handed down through oral tradition.Oriki is chanted on a variety of occasions such as annual festivals (annual acts of public worship) of the egungun, Ifa, and Ogun devotees. It is also chanted by the court musicians at royal and social events. It permeates the day to day life of individuals through greetings and homage -paying. Although poorly remunerated by the contemporary society, the artists who practice this art devote a great amount of time, energy, and dedication to acquiring the skill.As the verbal and musical art among the Yoruba, oriki occurs in various modes of performance, classified basically as speech or music modes. The music mode is the chant, of which iwi, iyere, ijala, and rara are the four main types. The poetic form, the shifting of tonal levels, and the use of modulation are the basic elements that, technically speaking, distinguish one type from another; aesthetically speaking, tone quality of voice production also differs among the chants. The artist exploits the multitonal system of the language in his musical rendering of the poetry.Oriki music is governed by certain aesthetic and artistic values that exist within the framework of the Yoruba society; understanding of these values is essential for a true understanding of the Yoruba concept of music and music -making.|Thesis collection|oriki music/egungun/homage-paying/ogun devotees/tonal levels/yoruba society.*||||||Yusufu Bala Usman|M|The Transformation Of Katsina: C,1796-1903.The Overthrow Of The Sarauta System And The Establishment And Evolution Of The Emirate||||||Ph.

This process of political transformation is traced from the crisis associated with the accession of the Sarkin Katsina, Gozo in c. 1796, right through the nineteenth century, to the British conquest of the Sokoto Caliphate in 1903.The kingdom of Katsina was a sovereign polity, with a political system centred on the institution of the Sarkin Katsina. The first Sarkin Katsina was Korau (c. 1444-1494), who overthrew the paramountcy that the rulers of Durbi-ta-kusheyi had established over the birane and garuruwa in the northern part of the Katsina central plains. The authority of the Durbis was based on their control and identification with the ancestor cults centred on the tombs (kusheyi) of Durbi-ta-kusheyi. The conditions created by a new pattern of economic activity in the area, and the growing heterogeneity of the population, enabled Korau to overthrow this authority and establish the beginnings of a more centralised political system. He closely identified his authority with Inna, the spirit of 'Mother' Earth and the central figure in the iskoki pantheon.The political system that evolved under the successors of Korau, was built of a hierarchy of sarakuna ruling over the birane and garuruwa; regulating the major forms of economic activity; running the affairs of the palace and the capital; and organising the army. Some of the sarakuna ruling over the ancient birane retained considerable autonomy, and some independent basis for their authority. In general, however, they were all subordinate to the Sarkin Katsina, the 'Magajin Korau', i.e. the heir of the powers of Korau and of Korau's successors. It was from these powers of the Sarkin Katsina, ritually transferred to every new Sarki in the rites of installation, that the central government derived the authority it exercised over a defined territory, the Kasar Katsina, and over the permanent inhabitants of that territory, the Katsinawa.By the late eighteenth century this kingdom had been engaged, for about three hundred years, in a system of international relations covering the Central Sudan and neighbouring areas, and two processes of integration involving it were taking place. Internally, hundreds of birane and garuruwa, and immigrant groups of diverse origin, were integrated into a political community under the Sarakunan Katsina. Externally, commerce, migration, and the spread of Islam, integrated the kingdom into the Islamic community of the bilad al-Sudan. These processes of integration involved considerable descent and occupational heterogeneity within the kingdom. One of the major consequences of this was that Islam  became the major bond of social cohesion and the source of the basic code of social conduct, especially in the towns and the densely settled rural areas subject to considerable migration. This development produced an Islamic intelligentsia providing leadership within these urban and rural communities distinct from the sarakuna. Although there had been instances of Muslim Sarakuna in Katsina, who actively supported Islam, and had close relations with some of the mallamai, they were, as a group, kept at a distance from political authority. Many of them kept their distance from a government which derived its authority from the powers of Korau, who had joined the iskoki pantheon as a son of Inna.This contradiction between the basic bond of social cohesion and the basis of political authority became sharper with the political crisis in the reign of Gozo, which led to his assassination in c. 1801. The eighteenth century had seen considerable political upheavals in the region, starting from the collapse of the great cities of Kebbi, to the destruction of the kingdom of Zamfara and the establishment of a new Gobir capital at Birnin Alkalawa. These had produced an atmosphere of great political uncertainty and insecurity in the region, and within Katsina had enhanced the power of the sarakunan yaki, who were prominent in the wars with Gobir and in the internal political crisis. The feelings of disquiet afflicting Muslims and non-Muslims in the region, caused by these upheavals, were getting an answer in the preaching of the mallamai of an Islamic reform movement led by Usman Dan Fodio.When a community of the reformist intelligentsia around Usman Dan Fodio defeated the Sarkin Gobir in June 1804, most of the governments of the region attacked his supporters. In Katsina, these were mainly mallamai living in the small towns of the densely settled central plains, in the Birnin Katsina and some of the larger towns in the west. They came together to defend themselves and emerged as an organised body, the, the jama'a, committed to the overthrow of the government. This government of the Sarkin Katsina Bawa Dan Gima (c.1801-1805), who belonged to a minor lineage of the dynasty, was paralysed by its internal divisions and the hostilities of those who sympathised with the assassinated Gozo. The jama'a subverted loyalty to the Sarkin Katsina, calling on the people to give their loyalty to the amir al-mu'minin (Sarkin Musulmi), Shehu Usman Dan Fodio. They succeeded in presenting the government, to the predominantly Muslim population of Katsina, as one of unbelievers, oppressors and warmongers. In a series of campaigns, with the word and the sword, coordinated with the mujahidddun in neighbouring kingdoms, they won over and took large numbers of settlement, besieged the capital, killed two of the successors of Bawa Dan Gima, routed the army and overthrew the government. During the campaign the Jama'a was organised in armed contingents which came under the three leading mujahiddun of Katsina, Mallam Muhammadu Na Alhaji, Mallam Umarun Dumyawa andMallam Umarun Dallaji, who had been authorised by the amir al-mu'minin to command expeditions. Although one of them, Umarun Dallaji, was later appointed emir of Katsina, political authority remained diffused in the hands of the various leaders of the contingents of the Jama'a, for almost a decade after their victory. Conflicts between the leading mujahiddun, rebellions in the Maradi area, on the Ingawa plains and the Maska region created conditions out of  which the emir Umarun Dallaji emerged with greater authority.The amir al-mu'minin Bello saw to the greater regularization of authority in the emirate; writing a short work on the principles of muslim politics for Umarun Dallaji, visiting Katsina personally and appointing one of his senior officials to supervise its government.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The rebellions in the Maradi area, caused by the heavy  exactions imposed on the arna of that remote border region, had provided a base for remnants of the old dynasty. These set out to reconquer Katsina, and one of them fostered a rebellion within the emirate, knitting together a number of local grievances, which shook the new system in 1842-43. The rebellion was crushed with the assistance of forces mobilised by the amir al-muminin from several emirates. The Emir, Saddiku (1836-1844), son of Umarun Dallaji, was deposed for insubordination by the amir al-mu'minin, and his brother Bello (1844-1870) was appointed, who followed the policy ordered from Sokoto regarding the areas affected by the rebellion. It was during his long reign that the emirate system in Katsina was consolidated. But, only after it was shaken by another crisis caused by the return of the deposed Saddiku with an army from Damagaram in 1853. The prompt response of the amir al-mu'minin Aliyu Babba (1842-1859) and Saddiku's profound misgivings [bout his whole conduct, saved the situation.The central institution of the new emirate system was the amir al-mu'minin at Sokoto. The authority of the amir al-mu'minin was derived from the Muslim community of the whole caliphate vesting him with responsibility for running its affairs, formally expressed in the act of bay'a. The amir al-mu'minin was bound by his oath to rule according to the Sharia and the Sunnah and to consult the mallamai and other leaders of the Muslim community in whatever he does. The central organ of the emirate system in Katsina was the office of the emir. The emir was an official of the amir al-mu'minin vested with specific powers over a defined territory. The appointment and dismissal of the emir was the sole prerogative of the amir al-mu'minin who was only bound by his oath. Theemir's most important responsibility was to see that the people under him perform their religious duties. He was also to see to the improvement in their living conditions. He was authorised to collect taxes and use these to fulfil his responsibilities. To carry out these responsibilities he appointed officials; but these were solely functionaries of the emirate government. Like the amir al-mu'minin he was bound by his oath to follow the Shari'a and the Sunnah and consult the mallamai and other leaders of the Muslim community.	Through the establishment of new towns and the extension of existing ones, the emirate government built a solid foundation for the new political system in these basic cells of the political community. The considerable urban development, which continued right up to the British conquest , received an added impetus from the raids of the rulers of  Maradi. By the late 1870s these were effectively contained although they continued up to 1903. The general trend of the concentration of power and wealth under the emir and his senior officials was connected with these developments. It was favoured by the centralised control of military activity. It also arose from the expansion of the economy in the middle years of the century and the policy of urban development which harnessed and stimulated this expansion. An important consequence of this trend, and of the proliferation of the family of Umarun Dallaji, was an intensification of dynastic rivalry. Although the authority  of Sokoto restrained this, the problem became a preoccupation of the late nineteenth century emirs. This further enhanced the power of Sokoto over the emirate government, but could have constituted a serious political problem if the British conquest in 1903 had not drastically given a new context and meaning to the whole political process.Central to all this process, from the epoch of the Durbis to the British conquest, was the transformation of the political order by changes taking place in the nature and pattern of occupations; the structure of lineages; the composition of settlements; and the changes in beliefs and ideology associated with these. This historical process was made up of long phases of evolution followed by periods of revolutionary transformation. It is only explicable in terms of changes in these substantial units of political community, seem in the context of developments over the whole of the central Sudan, as this thesis seeks to demonstrate.|Thesis collection|iskoki pantheon/amir al-mu'minin/jama'a/birane/Durbis/mallamai/sarkin musulmi*||||||Yusuf, Rafiu Olalekan|M|Revamping Existing Chemistry Programme In Nigeria Military School||||||M.A. Ed.

The results of the questionnaires, the review of literature including new science curricula reform movements contributed to the development of the model chemistry programme.Analysis of data and the result of matching the model constructed with the existing chemistry programme in NMS supported a number of conclusions. Some of these are:1.    No needs are ascertained, other than the aims of NMS, in  setting up the present chemistry programme.2.    Apart from the often reviewed aims of the NMS the institution  has no stated objectives for the existing chemistry programme.3.    The existing chemistry programme based solely on the requirements for success at the West African School Certificate Examination does not offer enough to enable the boys meet the challenges of modern science.4.	Essential curriculum factors have not contributed much to the existing chemistry programme at NMS.On the basis of the survey findings and the requirements for implementing the proposed chemistry programme the following recommendations, among others, were made:1.  The proposed chemistry programme should run through a six-year period with its first nine units running for the first three years and the last nine units for the last three years.2.   The procedure of the programme should emphasize the inductive/ deductive and inquiry/activity approaches and the applications of chemistry.3. The programme should be developed in accordance with the elements of the curriculum          4.  Science instructors, educators and other relevant professionals/ specialist should assist with the development of the course.5.

Since conversion cannot take place in a vacuum, the study begins by recounting very briefly the history of this people as they see themselves as having migrated from Borno to the eastern escarpment of Plateau State where they now live. It follows up with a review of the pre-colonial social organisation of the people which includes the systems of land tenure, kinship and marriage, age-organization, justice and government.But conversion is essentially a religious concept involving a switch from one type of religion to another. Accordingly, the study moves next to a consideration of pre-Christian religion of the people, beginning with such concepts as the Supreme Being, the ancestors, the fetishes, and the spirit men (zigwol); then discussing divination, and ending up with a treatment of the major festivals. Next follows the actual story of how the Cambridge University Missionary Party came and established the Christian Faith in 1910 at Kabwir. After that, the thesis reviews the major social and ideational changes that followed the arrival of the British in 1906. The foregoing provides us with the data essential to our attempt to sift out possible antecedents and determinants that could have been working for or against conversion. With the stage now set, the thesis examines some currently fashionable theories of conversion in respect of their adequacy to the Ngas material. The four major theories selected for attention are: the Instrumental; The Deprivation-and-Fulfilment; the 'Who-Whom and finally the Intellectualist.The thesis reaches the conclusion that, at least so far as the Ngas material is concerned, none of these single-factor theories is wholly adequate. In place of these theories, the thesis opts for a more complex view of conversion which allows that more than one factor may be operative in a given situation.                                                                                                                                                          |Thesis collection|Angas/pre-Christian religion/the ancestors/zigwol/conversion/'Who-Whom*||||||Olayiwola, Gbola |M|Neuropharmacological Properties Of Stachytarpheta Cayennensis Leaves (L.C.

The effects of the antagonists (flumazenil, atropine, yohimbine, and naltrexone) and cholinergic agonist (oxotremorine) were investigated to elucidate the receptors involved in the observed neuropharmacological activities of the plant in rats and mice. The lethal dose (LD50) was calculated for mice using the intraperitoneal route only and for rats using the peritoneal and oral routes. The LD50 of SCCR was 90 mg/kg, 90 mg/kg for SCBT, 102 mg/kg for SCAQ and 88 mg/kg for SCEA in mice (i.p; 24 hours). The LD50 of SCCR in rats was 600 mg/kg, 560 mg/kg for SCBT, 640 mg/kg for SCAQ and 485 for SCEA (p.o. 24 hours) while SCCR was 275 mg/kg, SCBT was 260, SCAQ was 265 mg/kg and SCEA was 210 mg/kg via the intraperitoneal route (24 hours). Sublethal doses were used for subsequent experiments. SCCR, SCBT and SCAQ inhibited NIR and SLA and prolonged PIST in rats and mice. SCEA stimulated both NIR and SLA and reduced PIST. Flumazenil abolished the effect of SCCR and SCBT on NIR and PIST. Naltrexone inhibited the sedative effect of SCAQ. Atropine and yohimbine did not reverse the sedative effect of SCCR, SCBT and SCAQ, The extract and fractions did not antagonize oxotremorine-induced tremor in mice. SCCR, SCBT and SCAQ but not SCEA showed anticonvulsant effect against leptazol and strychnine-induced convulsion in mice.SCCR, SCBT and SCAQ antagonized induced anxiety state in mice while SCEA was not anxiolytic. The anxiolytic effect of SCCR, SCBT and diazepam was blocked by flumazenil while the anxiolytic effect of SCAQ was antagonized by naltrexone. SCCR and SCBT abolished acetic acid- induced writhes in rats. SCCR and SCAQ increased pain threshold in the rat paw pressure and thermal (hot plate) experiments, suggesting a central analgesic effect. This effect was blocked by naltrexone and not flumazenil and the analgesic effect was also lost in morphine tolerant mice. Only the extract antagonized amphetamine-induced stereotypy in mice, indicating that it was effective against experimentally induced psychosis.The study concluded that the sedative, analgesic, anxiolytic and part of the anticonvulsant properties observed for the extract were mediated via the GABAergic, GABA-benzodiazepine, and opioid systems and these effects were also found in the butanol and aqueous fractions but not in the ethylacetate fraction. The dopaminergic system was involved in the antipsychotic effect found only in the extract but not in the fractions.|Thesis collection|ethylacetate/naltrexone/flumazenil/intraperitoneal route/anticonvulsant effect/Stachytarpheta Cayennensis*||||||Welsch, Delane Emil|M     |The Rice Industry In The Abakaliki Area Of Eastern Nigeria, 1964||||||Ph.

Since that time production has expanded and processing and distribution systems have developed. The Eastern Nigeria government, through the 1962-68 Development Plan , has singled out rice as the food crop on which major developmental efforts will be expended. This dissertation examines the problems of what place rice should have in the Eastern Nigerian economy and how government policy should be used to attain that place.First, the world rice situation was examined with respect to patterns of production, consumption, and international trade. Cost and quality standards were developed by which Nigeria's potential place in the world rice economy could be measured. Then the patterns of internal (Republic of Nigeria) production and consumption were determined, and projections of future demand were made. The next step was to divide the rice industry in Eastern Nigeria into four stages. Field surveys were carried out in each stage to determine the present structure of the rice industry and its potential. The stages and de-limitation in scope of each were: production, saucer-shaped inland swamps in Abakaliki Division; trading and processing, Abakaliki town-ship; distribution, Abakaliki Industrial Area; retail, four large urban areas in Eastern and two in Western Nigeria. Alternative organizations  of each stage of the industry were investigated. Both present and new inputs and their possible sources were considered.The analysis to this point considered non-normative information. Next, normative information on the situation was considered and a decision making framework designed which weighed both non-normative and normative information in seeking solutions to the rice problems to which this study is addressed. Normative concepts examined and used as criteria involved the goodness of individualism, group achievement, group leadership by consensus, higher standards and levels of living, equal distribution of income and ownership of wealth, full employment, government revenue, economic growth, and welfare, efficiency and profit. Conclusions from the study are as follows:1.	The quantity of rice demanded by consumers in Nigeria could double during each of the next few six year periods.2      The Abakaliki rice industry in December, 1963, was in adjustment with the world rice economy and had attained that adjustment without government influence, control, or expenditure.3.	Abakaliki rice can compete in the Nigerian market and, with improvement in quality, in the West African and world markets.4    	Yam and paddy enterprises are organized as efficiently as they can be with present factors of production. Yams are four times more profitable per acre harvested than paddy, but fallow requirements of yams, economic pressures on land, and the economics of rotations have resulted in the inclusion of paddy in the rotation and expansion of paddy production. One-third of the farms have adopted the most profitable rotation. Further profitable expansion of paddy production is possible on the other two-thirds of the farms.5.	Because no new factors of production have been developed, paddy cultivation is slipping into a low level equilibrium only 20 years after its first introduction.6.	Sources of profitable new factors (improved seed, water control, hand tools, and fertilizer) are readily available.7.	If the new factors are adopted, paddy production could be expanded ten-fold in Abakaliki Division as an important component of economic development.8.	The normative criteria, particularly individualism, equity, fuller employment, growth, and effective decision making, dictate that the organization of production and distribution be in the hands of individuals, with one exception. Supplemental irrigation structures servicing groups of farmers will require majority rule, or even more centralized decision making procedures, to replace the less effective group leadership by consensus.9.	The industry is neither a potential source of government revenue nor in need of government investment in direct productive capacity. Instead, the government should concentrate on the development and distribution of new technology and in the provision of facilities to service groups of farmers, preferably on an unsubsidized basis.|Thesis collection|rice industry/paddy production/Abakaliki rice/Eastern Nigeria/government revenue  *||||||Wangboje, Solomon Irein|M|A Program of Art Education For Prospective Teachers Of Art In The Secondary Schools Of Nigeria||||||Ph.

In order to develop the program, the following were investigated: a. the traditional art of Nigeria with a view to understanding its motivations, purposes and functions, within its cultural setting; b. the impact of western influence on Nigerian traditional art; c. the problems of contemporary art education in Nigeria, with particular reference to secondary schools.ProcedureTwo methods of inquiry were employed: 1. A survey of literature for data on the traditional and contemporary art of Nigeria, and 2. A questionnaire to gather information on the problems, aims, objectives, content and scope of art education in Nigerian secondary schools. Questionnaires were sent to fifty-five selected schools in Nigeria and an analysis of the responses supplemented the data for this study.FindingsThe major findings were: a. Nigeria possessed and still possesses a strong artistic tradition that dates back several thousand years, the art of Nok, Ife, and Benin being among the best known; b. Contrary to the often-held view that Nigeria's traditional art is dead as a result of its contact with western science and teaching, the traditional artists are still alive and maintaining the tradition, though not for the same motivations as their forebears; c. Contemporary Nigerian art is not necessarily inferior in quality to the achievements of the past, rather it is a reflection of the times in which the artists live; d. The impact of western influence was shown as the introduction of fresh techniques and materials, alteration of the form of expression by the adoption of new idioms, and the change in the whole content of ideas; e. An acute shortage of qualified art teachers and, where teachers are available, the range of activities in the school art program is so narrow and circumscribed that it does not serve the broad interests of students.RecommendationsOn the basis of data collected, the study was concluded with an art education program based on the following:1. Nigeria's history of a strong art tradition, coupled with her continued interest in fostering and maintaining it, offers a fertile and receptive climate for an art program designed to encourage and foster the continuation of that tradition. It should serve as a basis upon which a new art program can be built -such a program would draw its strength and inspiration from the art of the past but would be designed to serve the needs of the present and the probable future. This would require an expansion in the choice of media and techniques to include selected international art techniques.2.There are several hundred master craftmen in Nigeria whose knowledge||*||||||Olabiyi Olusola|M|Respiratory Activities In Seedlings Of Vigna Unguiculata ( Linn. ) Walp ( A C3 - plant ) In Relation To Heat Stress||||||M.

It was hypothesized that there is no significant relationship between school size and students' participation in (a) games and sporting activities, (b) clubs and societies and (c) leadership training societies.Six hundred and forty respondents constituted the subjects of the study with 320 subjects from each of the large and small schools. These were drawn from the four educational zones of the state; namely: lbadan, Oyo, Osogbo and Ilesa. A research instrument designated "Students' Co-curricular Activities Questionnaire" was used to collect data from the students, and chi-square was used to analyse the data in  line with the hypotheses using a confidence level of  0.05.Results of the analysis showed that there was a significant relationship between school size and students' particiption in games and sporting activities, (X2 = 143.6;df = 2; P<0.05) clubs and socities (X2 =4.7 ;df = 2, P <0.05 ) and societies for leadership role training (X2= 2.23; df = 2; P >0.05 ). The bigger the size, the more the students' participation. Thus, there is a positive relationship between school size and students' participation.The study recommends that the Federal and State education systems should promote and encourage co-curricular activities in schools as these promote cohesiveness and unity among students.|Thesis collection|leadership role training/co-corricular activities/clubs and societies/educational zones/research instrument.*||||||Olaiya, Taiwo Akanbi|M|Management Of Crises In Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile - Ife, Nigeria: 1979-1999||||||M.

In addition, effort was made to examine the roles played by theVice-Chancellors in the management  of  conflicts  in the University.Primary and secondary data were utilized for the study. Primary data were collected through questionnaires and personal interview. Secondary data were extracted from relevant publications and texts.The study discovered that welfare issues, students' leadership problem, poor university financing by the National University Commission (NUC) and general intransigence of students in crises periods were among the principal factors causing crises in the university. The study also found evidence of mismanagement of crises, which often made them violent.On the role of Vice-Chancellors as a central figure in crises management on campus, a total of four Vice-Chancellors were assessed using their leadership style, organizational competence and positive relations with student and staff as criteria. These assessments were used in categorizing the VCs into 'Good Managers', 'Moderate Managers', and 'Poor Managers' of crises. In this regard, it was observed that most conflicts that escalated in the University might have been averted if the authorities had been more sensitive and the students more flexible in crises periods. The study concluded that, among other things, the welfare and aspirations of staff and students remain critical for conflict management in Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife.|Thesis collection    |leadership problem/moderate managers/crises management/poor managers/vice-chancellors*||||||Olaogun, Adenike Ayobola|F|The Contributions Of Spiritual Birthing Homes To Reproductive Health Care In Osun State||||||Ph.

Ile-Ife, Ilesa and Osogbo provided the samples studied. Religious denominations operating SBHs as part of their tenets selected include Christ Apostolic Church (CAC), The Apostolic Church (TAC) and the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG). A total of five SBHs were selected. One hundred and seventy nine females and 110 males consented to participate in the study. A 4 - point Likert scale was used to measure the respondents' assessment of care at facilities. Nine in depth interviews were conducted with top ranking ministers of the denominations and the officers running the SBHs. Four focus group discussions were held with members of the public who were not members of these denominations. The respondents were grouped into female/ male literate and illiterate groups. The facilities of each SBH were assessed for the number of personnel, equipment and clients. The practices of the workers were also observed. Data was analyzed using the SPSS and Text Base Beta. The results showed that SBH provided antenatal, intrapartum, postnatal, mother/toddler's and infertility care. The median age at first pregnancy of the women utilizing the SBH was 23 years. The number of birth attendants had increased from one at inception of each SBH to two or three. There was a steady increase in patronage between 2000 and 2004, even though the facilities were deficient in equipment. Complications associated with pregnancy reported at these facilities were aneamia, malaria, placenta praevia, breech positions and post maturity. Only 3 cases were referred for caesarian section. Others were treated with prayers, counseling and diet prescription. The result of the paired t test showed that there was significant difference in the assessment of the following parameters with t critical= 2; p < 0.05 between the SBH and the orthodox; the adequacy of personnel (t cal = - 4.640), the antenatal care (t cal = - 5.946), intrapartum care (t cal = -8.670), the post natal care (t cal = -7.558), client-staff interaction (t cal = -6.833) and in the flexibility/ rigidity observed during visiting time (t cal = - 5.642). However there was no significant difference in the availability of equipment. At p < 0. 0 5 and df =1, the Spearman's correlation revealed that it was only the level of education (r- = 0.119) that had a weak but significant association with the respondents' future use of SBH. The respondents' sex (r = 0.0 5 ), income (r = 0. 005) and occupation (r = 0. 0 85) did not have any significant association.Other factors informing SBH patronage included, high user  fee charged in orthodox facilities, poverty, lack of knowledge of available facilities and incivility of hospital workers.The study concluded that the SBH could be regarded as a subsystem within the reproductive healthcare system.

The chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the water was used as an index of the total organic nutrients present in the water while the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of the water was correlated to the amount of readily usable organic nutrients present in the water. The water samples were inoculated in media containing 0.15 g/l and 56 g/l of nutrient agar in replicates. Bacteria growths on the former medium were referred to as oligotrophs while growths on the latter medium were called copiotrophs, and their populations were determined by standard plate count method. The oligotrophic isolates were subsequently subjected to increasing nutrient concentrations of nutrient agar ranging from 0.15 g/l to 28 g/l and decreasing nutrient concentrations ranging from 0.14 g/l to 0.05 g/l to determine their maximum and minimum growth nutrient requirements respectively. The same was done for the copiotrophic bacterial isolates with nutrient concentrations ranging from 56 g/l to 0.1 g/l of nutrient agar to determine the minimum growth nutrient requirement.The average copiotrophic bacterial population in the water samples was 4.43 x 105 cfu/ml and 5.4 x 105 cfu/ml in the wet and dry seasons respectively while the oligotrophic bacterial population average was 1.9 x 103 cfu/ml and 1.3 x 103 cfu/ml in the wet and dry seasons respectively. The percentage of usable organic nutrients in the water was 44.5% and 52.2% in the wet and dry seasons respectively and 55.5% and 47.8% for non-usable organic nutrients for the same period. A total of seven and six oligotrophic bacterial species were selected and identified for the dry and wet seasons respectively. All the oligotrophic bacterial species encountered showed facultative properties and no obligate oligotroph was encountered. Alcaligenes feacalis, Klebsiella edwardsii, Klebsiella pneumonieae, Pseudomonas spp., Salmonella paratyphi and Shigella dysentariae occurred as both oligotrophs and copiotrophs during this study.The reservoir water contained a limited amount of usable organic nutrients for bacterial utilization and the water provided a more favourable condition for the primary productivity of the bacteria during the dry season. The ability of the encountered bacteria to flourish under limited and adequate nutrient supply showed nutritional versatility. The isolation of facultative oligotrophic and copiotrophic bacteria from the Opa Reservoir revealed that it contained habitat niches comprising limited organic nutrient regions and excess organic nutrient regions for bacterial utilization.In conclusion, no bacterial species could be labelled as obligate oligotrophic or copiotrophic; its existence as either of the two could only be a function of the nutritional conditions it experiences at any given time in the reservoir.|Thesis collection|copiotrophs/opa reservoir/facultative oligotrophic/nutrient agar/Shigella dysentariae/bacterial utilization*||||||Okunade, Adeoluwa Ayokunle|M|Form, Structure And Function In Hubert Ogunde's Music Drama||||||M.

The Beatification of Area Boy was chosen for this study because of the interest the works of the playwright generated in the literary world as well as the ability of the playwright to, capture the socio-cultural and economic realities of the society through the use of language.The findings showed that Sanda was the central character around whom the entire play revolved. Mama-Put and Big Man Shopper were authoritative and as such made use of directives in dealing with characters of lower status. It was discovered that the variety of the particular language used in the play enabled the playwright to stratify his characters into different social classes.

Sixty (60) healthy pregnant women were recruited in the first trimester with a follow up of 48 in the second trimester and 12 in the third trimester. Twenty-four healthy age-matched non-pregnant women served as the controls. Five milliliters of venous blood were collected from both the control and pregnant women once every trimester for haematological tests. Some haematological parameters measured included red cells indices e.g. heamoglobin concentration (Hb), haematocrit (Hct), red blood cell count (Rbc), mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell haemoglobin (MCH), mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), white blood cell count (Wbc) and platelet count (PIt) using an automated blood cell counter (ADVIA 60). Other parameters such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), reticulocyte count (RC), blood film appearance and differential leukocyte count were done manually following standard operating procedures. Data collected were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistical methods.The haematological parameters of the control group were within normal laboratory reference values that is, Hb (13.5 ± 0.9 g/dL), Hct (41.5 ± 2.5%), Rbc (4.7 ± 0.65 106/mm3), Wbc (4.7 ± 3.5 103/mm3) and PIt (282. 8 ± 96.0 103/mm3). As expected red cell indices measured decreased as pregnancy progressed, especially between the 2nd and 3rd trimesters (P < 0.01). Red cell indices during pregnancy were significantly lower than those of controls (P < 0.01). No significant feature of iron deficiency was observed probably because the pregnant women were on iron tablets. The anaemia observed in pregnancy was not severe (mean Hct was 28.5 ± 4.5% in the 3rd trimester). ESR rose steadily throughout pregnancy but RC remained the same. Both however were significantly higher than in the non-pregnant state.The study concluded that healthy non-pregnant women were not generally anaemic in this environment contrary to public opinion. Severe anaemia was not associated with uncomplicated pregnancies.        |Thesis collection|trimesters/reticulocyte count/haematological parameters/pregnant women/platelets count/severe anaemia*||||||Oloyede, Funmilayo Mary|F|Effect Of Phosphorus Fertilizer On The Performance And Nutrient Composition Of Snake Tomato (Trichosanthes Cucumerina Linn.)||||||M.

The aim was to determine the response of two landraces of snake tomato (Trichosanthes cucumerina L.) in terms of growth, fruit yield and nutrient quality to phosphorus fertilization and growing seasons.The landraces, Variant I and Variant II, were evaluated at five levels of P( 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 kg P205 ha-1) using single superphosphate fertilizer. The experiment was a split plot design in a factorial arrangement with four replications. The factors were the two variants of T. cucumerina and the five levels of phosphorus. All data collected were subjected to analysis of variance. Means, where significantly different, were separated using Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT) at 5% level of probability. Regression analysis was performed for traits that had significant season and phosphorus mean squares.Results showed that fruit yield was dependent on season (r2 = 0.97) and P levels (r2 = 0.99). The 90 kg P205 ha-1 gave statistically significantly higher number of leaves, vine length and fruit yield (16.4 tons ha-1) compared to other P levels. The early season crops (22.2 tons ha -1) significantly out yielded the late season crops (13.3 tons ha-1). The fruit yield of the two variants did not differ significantly. Except for crude protein content, the 90 kg P205 ha-1 produced significantly higher ether extract (fat) (1.22 g 100g -1), crude fibre (1.93 g 100g -1), moisture content (89.7 g 100g -1), ash (0.89 g 100g -1), total sugars (0.81 g 100g -1) and ascorbic acid (28.7 mg 100g -1) than other P levels. Variant I had significantly higher ether extract (0.90 g 100g -1 ) content than Variant II (0.62 g 100g -1) while Variant II, in turn, had significantly higher total sugars (0.76 g 100g -1) compared to Variant I (0.61 g 100g -1). The crude protein and moisture content were significantly higher during the early season than the late season while the ether extract content was higher in the late season than the early season.In conclusion, with the above quality of snake tomato especially the ascorbic acid content, this indigenous fruit vegetable of Nigeria has high nutrient quality to correct malnutrition, alleviate hunger and consequently alleviate poverty, preserve the biodiversity and increase the gene bank of neglected wild species of high quality nutrient sources.|Thesis collection|snake tomato/phosphorus fertilizer/Variant II/crude fibre/landraces/gene bank*||||||Olofin, Olabode Philip|M|Money Supply And Economic Growth In Nigeria||||||M.

In carrying out this objective, the study made use of secondary data obtained from the CBN Statistical Bulletin (various issues), and Federal Office of  Statistics monthly Bulletin (various issues).Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation technique was used to examine the trend and growth of money supply in the Nigeria economy.In testing the hypothesis that money supply directly determines income level, as suggested by Sims (1972) model, income function was specified and estimated, using Granger causality test. To examine the impact of money supply on economic growth, Vector Autoregressive method was employed, and the results of impulse response and variance decomposition were analyzed.The main finding, which arose from this study, shows that changes in the stock of money, is an important determinant of the level of economic activity in Nigeria. Further evidence shows that the causal relationships between money and income run from money supply to economic activities. The Probability result was 0.01, while the F-statistic was 4.6. This fact supports the Sims (1972) conclusion that there is unidirectional causality between money supply and economic growth. Although, the result of the causality obtained in the study indicates weak causation running from money supply to economic activities in the Nigeria economy. It was suggested that weak causation arrived at in this study might have been caused by the fact that increased money supply might have not been directed towards productive investment. This follows the fact that direct influence on money supply by the monetary authorities is expected to exert some degree of influence on nominal income.Also, the results of the Ordinary Least Square method adopted showed that there is an upward movement in the trend and growth of money supply in the Nigerian economy during the period under study. The Probability was 0.0000, and it was significant at 5% level.In addition, the result of the impulse response showed that the response of real GDP to the shock in real money was positive and even greater than the response from money supply itself. This response was positive and it fluctuated in a downward direction. It ranges from 12% to 6% for the 10 periods analyzed, while the response of money supply to own self-shock also fluctuated in a downward direction, ranging from 11% to 4%. This result was also supported by the result from the variance decomposition of real money supply. It was discovered that real GDP accounted for most of the variation in real money supply, while money supply itself came second in determining variation in itself. This variation from real GDP ranges from 53% to about 61%, while that of real money supply ranges between 46% to about 33%. For the variance decomposition of real GDP, apart from real GDP itself, which ranges from 100% down to 52%, money supply was the next variable that accounts for more variation in real GDP. It ranges between 0% to about 29%. This level of variation in real GDP was followed by real interest rate and real capital stock came last.|Thesi collection|Ganger causality test/Ordinary Least Square/money supply/nominal income/Vector Autoregressive*||||||Oladapo, Adebayo Akanbi|M|An Evaluation Of The Maintenance Management Of The Staff Housing Estates Of Selected First Generation Universities In Southwestern Nigeria.||||||Ph.

The data were analysed using parametric and non-parametric analyses, severity index analysis, and analytic hierarchy process (AHP).The study showed that the maintenance system was characterised by inadequate funding and inappropriate policies and practice. The state of maintenance index (SEMI) of 0.57 and the tenants' satisfaction index (TSI) of 0.55, both on a scale of 0 to 1, indicated a positive relationship between housing stock condition and tenants' satisfaction. The SMI was 0.62 for University of Ibadan (UI), 0.56 for University of Lagos (UNILAG) and 0.53 for Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) while the TSIs were 0.54, 0.56 and 0.55 for OAU, UI and UNILAG respectively. Regression analysis (R2 =0.482, significant at 0.001) indicated that the state of structure and fabric, services, aesthetics and surroundings of houses significantly accounted for about half of the total variation in the state of the housing stock. The tenants rated structure and fabric (ranked 1) and services (ranked 4) as the best and worst attributes respectively of the housing  stock condition.The study also showed that age of the building (Severity index =88.4%) and height of the building (Severity index = 54.97%) were the most and the least important respectively of the eleven determinants of maintenance need considered. Using the analytic hierarchy process, the relative weights (RW) of the multi-attribute priority criteria were building status (RW=0.45), effects on users (RW=0.25), importance of usage (RW=0.13), physical condition (RW=0.10) and effects on fabric (RW=0.07) in descending order. The priority preferences of tenants were not significantly different from those of the maintenance staff (p>0.05). The closeness of the maintenance staff job satisfaction index of 0.60 to the tenants' satisfaction index of 0.55 confirmed in this study the hypothesis of several empirical studies that employee satisfaction of service providers largely determines customer satisfaction. The study found that the performance rating of the maintenance organization at the University of Ibadan was the best, followed by the University of Lagos and then Obafemi Awolowo University.The study concluded that the control of the determinants of maintenance needs and causes of decay significantly affected maintenance performance. Employee satisfaction, the maintenance departments' responsiveness to tenants' complaints and the maintenance backlog were critical in the performance evaluation of the maintenance departments.|Thesis collection|maintenance system/tenant's satiafaction index/structure and fabric/housing stock/hierarchy process                    *||||||Ologunde, Adedoyin Olusola|F|Motivation and Labour Turnover Among University Teachers In SouthWestern  Nigeria                 ||||||M.

It also examined the level of voluntary quits among the sampled population between year 1993 and 2002 noting the trends, and the impact of motivation on their continued stay in the university system.Primary and secondary data were utilized for the study. The instruments used to elicit information included a structured questionnaire administered on respondents from four universities: Obafemi Awolowo University (O.A.U.), Ile-Ife; Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso; Federal University of Technology Akure, (FUTA); and Olabisi Onabanjo University (OOU) Ago- Iwoye. The Universities were randomly selected from the ten universities in the southwestern zone of Nigeria. A study sample of 600 university teachers was selected using a stratified sampling technique. Samples were selected from the existing seven job ranks within the academic cadre.  Professors, Readers, Senior Lecturers, Lecturer I, lecturer II, Assistant Lecturers and Graduate Assistants. Copies of the. questionnaire were distributed based on the proportions of these ranks in each university. About 74% questionnaire return rate was recorded, thereby giving a total number of 442 study samples. Secondary data were obtained from official records and publications of the sampled universities. Data collected were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics.The study showed that motivation actually affected labour turnover of university teachers in Southwestern Nigeria as supported by a high and positive correlation coefficient of 0.879, showing that there was high and positive relationship between motivation and labour turnover among the University teachers. The study further revealed that there were two categories of motivational factors: economic and non-economic, and that lecturers were more motivated by non-economic factors, which include challenging job, feeling of achievement, compatible work group, responsibility, advancement, recognition, training and development. The economic incentives available were found to be inadequate for the retention of lecturers within the university system.The study concluded that there was no adequate motivation for university lecturers and this negatively affected their job performance|Thesis collection| Readers/Graduate Assistants/compatible work group/labour turnover/non-economic factors                      *||||||Oluborode, Adebola Afis|M|Production Needs Of Rural Youth For Sustainable Crop Farming In Ogun State, Nigeria.||||||M.

It also examined factors militating against their performance on the farm with a view to identifying the production needs of rural youth for sustainable crop farming.This study was conducted in all the four administrative divisions in Ogun State. Structured interview schedule was used to elicit information from 353 rural youth crop farmers. One Local Government Area (LGA) was purposively selected from each of the four major divisions. Two rural communities in which many farm youths were actively involved in crop farming were purposively selected from each of the selected LGA, which represented about seven percent of the estimated population of rural youth whose ages ranged between 13 and 30 in each of the rural communities. Descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were used to analyse the data.Results showed that credit facility, subsidy on farm inputs, incentives, recognition on the job, drinkable water supply, health care and electricity were their major needs for sustainance in crop farming. However, parent wish, absence of basic social amenities and methods of farming were the major factors militating against their participation in crop farming. The production needs are: fertilizers, tractor services, bulldozer services, hand gloves, cutlasses, herbicides, storage facilities, processing facilities and hoes.Positive and significant association existed between production needs and rural youth characteristics viz sex (x2c = 24.55,at degree of freedom = 2) ; religion (x2c =27.00 at degree of freedom = 6); mode of living (x2c = 22.79 at degree of freedom = 8); career aspiration (x2c = 120.56 at degree of freedom = 4); communication skill (x2c = 75.73 at degree of freedom = 4); major occupation (x2c = 91.73 at degree of freedom = 4); parental dependency (x2c= 97.71 at degree of freedom = 4); ownership of farm (x2c = 27.74 at degree of freedom = 2); source(s) of finance for farming activities (x2c = 49.31 at degree of freedom = 10); reason(s) for going into farming (x2c = 30.00 at degree of freedom = 6); preference for non-farming economic activities (x2c = 53.15 at degree of freedom = 4); level of formal education (x2c = 160.15 at degree of freedom = 4); occupational status (x2c = 50.99 at degree of freedom = 10 ); and external orientation (x2c = 74.94 at degree of freedom = 4) at 0.05 level of significance. Also, years of formal education (r = 0.219); years of farming (r = 0.12) and level of income (r = 0.14) had positive and significant (p<0.05) correlation with the production needs. Conversely, a negative but significant (p<0.05) correlation existed between production needs and family size (r = - 0.186); level of satisfaction in crop farming (r =- 0.10); and needs for sustainability in crop farming (r = -0.15).In conclusion, majority of the youths had access to adequate farmland; however, the major needs for their sustainable participation in crop farming activities were farm inputs.|Thesis collection|crop farming/bulldozer services/parental dependency/rural youth/farm imputs/herbicides*||||||Oluseye, Ogunkunle Clement|M|Assessment Of The Effects Of Various Agro-System Practices On The Environment In Ifedayo Local Government Area Of Osun State||||||M.

Measurements were carried out on trees that were 5 m and above for tree density, tree height, girth, tree basal area and volume of wood in each sample plots. Soil samples collected from 0-15cm depth were sieved and standard laboratory techniques were used to analyze for soil organic matter, soil moisture, available phosphorus, nitrate-nitrogen and pH.The result showed that there was reduction in the species composition of the study sites compared to the natural forest. The three study sites showed a considerable improvement in soil nutrients due to mineralization of leaf litter except for the teak site. There was significant difference in the soil and plant parameters between the studied sites at p<0.05. The index of species diversity was high in the forest site and the magnitude decreased as follows; forest (10.06) > bush fallow (5.35) > cocoa/kola (3.54) > teak (0.32) respectively. Total basal area and volume of wood were higher in the forest site (9.95 m2ha -1 and 260.109 m3ha- l respectively) compared with other agroforestry sites. The vegetation deterioration indices in these sites ranged between 29.4 %-99.6 % for teak site, 45.6 %-98.4 % for bush fallow site and 57.3 %-96.7 % for cocoa/kola site respectively. The soil deterioration indices of teak site were higher as shown in moisture content (55.7 %), organic matter (51.5 %), available phosphorus (60.0 %) and nitrate-nitrogen (44.7 %). In contrast, soil elements in cocoa/kola and bush fallow sites were not impoverished (deterioration indices range from 4.9 % to 21.9 % and 8.7 % to 34.8 % respectively).In conclusion, the study showed a drastic reduction in the floristic composition of the study sites (teak, cocoa/kola and bush fallow) compared to the natural forest.|Thesis collection|soil moisture/teak site/cocoa/kola plantation/bush fallow/tree basal area/natural forest*||||||Olusola , Kayode Olarewaju|M|Orin Ogun:Traditonal War Songs Among The Oyo -Yoruba  ||||||M.

It also examined the various types of Orin-Ogun, its functions as well as the physical structure of musical instruments used in performance in order to highlight the content and form of the music.The methodology consisted of oral interview with various Yoruba traditionalists as well as the observation of dramatic performances by various theater groups. Musical data were collected through video and tape recorder and classified according to their contents and functions. The analysis was done at both textual and musical levels, using ethnomusicological theories. The secondary data consisted of a review of relevant literature.The study found that there were three categories of Orin-ogun, namely; war mobilization songs, war processional songs and war victory songs. It was also found that lya-Ilu Dundun, (mother drum) played the vocal role in Orin-Ogun while Omele-ako Omele-abo and Gudugudu (smaller components) provided instrumental rhythmic accompaniments. The musical form observed include the song form and the spoken verse form. Some pieces of music in song form were arranged in call-and-response, while others were in monostropphic patterns. Most songs in spoken verse form had their poetic structure in short verse while few others were structured in the long verse form.It was concluded that, Orin-Ogun was a unique and special purpose musical genre among the Yoruba because of the rare and spontaneous nature of its composition, usage and practice. The high intensity with strong accents and the dissonance created by the loud gun-shot and noises from other weapons of war also differentiated the music from other Yoruba musical genres.|Thesis Collection|War victory songs/musical instrument/ethnomusicological/Iya-Ilu Dundun/monostropphic patterns/gun-shot*||||||Olusola, Kolapo Olubunmi |M|Factors  Affecting the Compressive Strength and Elastic Properties of  Laterized Concrete Specimens||||||Ph.D.Building Structures|Adesanya, D.

The objectives of the study were to, investigate the effects of varying cube specimen size and maximum aggregate size on the cube compressive strength, assess the effects of mix proportions, curing age, maximum aggregate size, percentage laterite content and stress level on elastic properties (namely, modulus of elasticity, modulus of deformability and Poisson's ratio) of laterized concrete, and investigate the relationship between the cube compressive strength and modulus of elasticity.To achieve these objectives, a factorial laboratory experimental design approach was adopted. For the compressive strength tests, a total of 558 cubes of different sizes were cast and tested. For the other two main tests on elastic properties, a total of 135 cube (150mm size) and 765 prism specimens (l00xl00x300mm) were cast and tested. The tests were conducted in conformity with the British Standard 1881(1983). Experimental data were analysed with the use of graphs, regression analysis, analysis of variance and procedures for pairwise comparison of factor main effects.The results showed that the compressive strength of laterized concrete specimens increased significantly (p<0.05) with both specimen size,D,and maximum aggregate size, d, (F-statistics = 293.501 and 90.804 respectively, with significance value in each case at 0.000) provided the ratio D/d lies between 4 and 7. The modulus of elasticity, modulus of deformability and Poisson's ratio of laterized concrete specimens decreased with an increase in the level of applied stress and with an increase in the percentage laterite content. Both moduli of elasticity and deformability and Poisson's ratio were however, observed to increase with increase in maximum aggregate size, curing age and the richness of a mix proportion. Analysis of variance results indicated that all the factors investigated had significant effects (p<0.05 and significance values of 0.000) on the measured elastic properties.The study further showed that the modulus of elasticity and the compressive strength of laterized concrete were related but not directly proportional. Regression analysis (F-statistic = 423.714 with significance value at 0.000) of the relationship between modulus of elasticity and cube compressive strength indicated that 92.6% (R2 = 0.926) of the variation in the former could be explained by the variability in the measured values of the latter. The modulus of elasticity per unit strength decreased with an increase in the compressive strength and age of laterized concrete. The results indicated that the modulus of elasticity and Poisson's ratio of laterized concrete were respectively, on the average, 72% and 94% of those of normal concrete.The study concluded that laterized concrete behaved like normal structural concrete with respect to strength and elastic properties. Also, the strengths and elastic constants obtained for laterized concrete make it suitable for structural purposes in low-rise building construction|Thesis Collection|strength and elastic properties/maximum aggregate size/laterized concrete/curing age/compressive strength/Poisson's ratio*||||||Olunlade, Taiwo Aderemi|M|Ilo Litireso Alohun Yoruba Ninu Iwe-Iroyin Yoruba Lati Odun 1859 De 1960 (The Use Of Yoruba Oral Literature In Yoruba Newspapers From 1859 To 1960)||||||Ph.

It also highlighted the inter-textualities of Yoruba oral literature and the contents of these maiden sets of newspapers, and the overall impacts which they both had on the Yoruba literate and civil societies. Moreover, it appraised the creative ingenuity of the pioneer-writers of these papers who, for stylistic, aesthetic and thematic effects, amply employed the use of Yoruba oral genres in the newspapers.The methodology employed involved the collection of twenty Yoruba newspapers published between 1859 to 1960. This was complemented by library and archival research. Oral interviews were also conducted among the literate but fairly old people who know part of the period when the newspapers were in circulation. The analysis of the data was carried out within the framework of sociology of literature.The study found that Yoruba oral materials such as panegyrics, riddles, proverbs, fictional stories, taboos and songs were effectively and extensively used in the newspapers of the period under study. The study identified eleven different ways in which Yoruba praise and descriptive poetry (oriki) were used in casting news headlines and other captions. The use of the Yoruba praise and descriptive poetry in this way was also found to be a major motiff in the newspapers. Other themes in the newspapers included concise autobiographies, stories related to the provenance of towns and communities and some other forms of literary creativity at large.The study concluded that Yoruba oral genres provided good source materials for education and entertainment among the Yoruba. Also, the genres were found to be inseparable from both the pre-literary and literary lifes of the Yoruba people as they formed a dependable hub around which our contemporary written literature radiates.|Thesis collection|Yoruba literate/civil societies/Yoruba praise and descriptive poetry (oriki)/Yoruba oral genres/aesthetic and thematic effects.*||||||Owoeye, Durojaye Kehinde|M|Fantasy, Realism And The Reconstruction Of The Postcolony In Selected Novels Of Ben Okri And Salman Rushdie||||||M.

Deconstructionist and psychoanalytical theories were used to interpret the texts. A review of critical thoughts on the novels was carried out.The findings showed that, despite being members of the magical realist fold, Ben Okri and Salman Rushdie, due to sundry reasons, ranging from historical to personal convictions on poIitics, culture and society, charted different stylistic courses, all in a bid to foreground the fluidity that characterized events in the magical realm. It was also observed that both authors were influenced fundamentally by the catholic tenets of postmodernism. Finally, the study revealed that tried as the authors did, they could not divorce postcoloniality from the legacy of colonialism or neo-imperialism.The study concluded that postmodemist feelings were stronger and more palpable in Salman Rushdie than Ben Okri.

The mixture was successively partitioned into ethyl acetate and n-butanol. This produced three fractions, Fe., Fb and Fa from the ethyl acetate, butanol and aqueous fractions respectively. The fractions were concentrated to dryness in vacuo.The three fractions were further separated by chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 column. The Fe yielded three sub fractions Z I, Z2 and Z3; Fb yielded six sub fractions XI- X6 while the Fa yielded four sub fractions, YI-Y4. The whole latex and fractions were assayed for their effects on whole blood clotting time, Prothrombin Time (PT), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT), Haemagglutinating activity and bleeding time. In an attempt to identify the active components, the fractions were phytochemically screened. The partially purified fractions were also subjected to infrared spectroscopy.Investigation of the coagulant activity of the J. curcas latex showed that whole latex significantly (P < 0.01) reduced the clotting time of human blood. Diluted latex, however, prolonged the clotting time; at high dilutions, the blood did not clot at all. This indicated that J. curcas latex possessed both procoagulant and anticoagulant activities. Prothrombin time and Activated partial Thromboplastin time tests on plasma confirmed these observations. In general, results of bleeding time tests were similar to those obtained with coagulation tests. Solvent partitioning of the latex with ethyl acetate and butanol led to a partial separation of the two opposing activities: at low concentrations, the ethyl acetate fraction (Fe) exhibited a procoagulant activity while the butanol fraction (Fb) had the highest anticoagulant activity.The residual aqueous fraction (Fa) had no significant effect on the clotting time of blood and the Prothrombin time but slightly prolonged the activated Partial Thromboplastin time. The latex, as well as the fractions Fe, Fb, and Fa agglutinated red blood cells with very high titres, 215, 29, 210 and 29 respectively. The other fractions had lost most of the agglutinating activity with the attempt at purification, except for Z3 that had a titre of 214. Phytochemical screening of the latex showed the presence of tannins, saponins, alkaloids and flavonoids. This was partially supported by the infrared spectra of the solvent fractions and sub fractions. Results of the PT test on the latex or its solvent fractions did not show remarkable anticoagulant effect while the results of the APTT test portrayed a very strong anticoagulant effect. This indicated that the J. curcas latex anticoagulant inhibited factor(s) in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation.In conclusion, this study, while providing the rationale for the ethnomedical usage of the latex of the plant as a haemostatic, also gave the first record of an anticoagulant activity in the latex of J. curcas.|Thesis collection|Phytochemical screening/Thromboplastin time/Haemagglutinating activity /ethnomedical usage/anticoagulant activity/flavonoids.*||||||Orimoogunje, Oluwagbenga oluwapamilerin |M|The Impact Of Land Use Dynamics On Oluwa Forest Reserve In Southwestern, Nigeria.||||||Ph.

The study made use of data generated from Landsat  MSS 1972, Landsat TM 1991 and 2000 coupled with intensive fieldwork (2004). The satellites images covering the area were acquired and analyzed using Multipscope 3.0 software package. The observed changes were mapped and the results of the classification were prepared as different themes in a GIS mode using ILWIS 3.1 and Arcview 3.2. The total land area delimited in the study area within which changes were monitored over the period of 28years was 184,741 hectares. The statistical methods used to analyse the field data included Simpson's index of diversity, Principal Component Analysis and the Ordination technique. Models of changes, viz., cultural, resource, economic and ecological equilibrium were used to analyze forces that played dominant roles in setting priorities for action with regard to landuse changes in the study area. The study revealed that agricultural landuses which was non-existent in 1972 increased three-folds from 8,176 hectares (4.43%) in 1991 to 112,172 hectares (60.72%) of the total land area in year 2000. The non-agricultural land uses (settlement) increased by about six folds from 4932.6 hectares in 1972 to 30,911 hectares (about 16.73%) in the year 2000. The most significant contributor to the agricultural degradation of Oluwa forest was the use of land for arable crop, which accounted, for more than 30% of the total agricultural landuse. The forest reserve declined by more than a factor of six of its original size from 130,774 hectares in 1972 to 19,382 hectares in 2000. Over 1,121 km2 of the forestlands got transformed to agricultural landuse over the 28 years period.The species ordination showed three dominant ecological communities in Oluwa Forest Reserve. The first was made up mainly of relics of forest species and tree crops; the second comprised plantation included a number of exotic elements and food crops ;and the third group was composed of forest unit composed solely of species ecologically associated with the forest ecosystem. Two effects of changes on species were identified. The first was the replacement of what could be considered as the original species by other species tolerant of the 'new ' ecosystem. The other was the reduction in the range of the original species that could be found. This was an indication that the area had been fragmented from its original status. This confirmed that the original species components of the Oluwa Forest Reserve were degraded at a relatively fast rate. The study concluded that Oluwa Forest Reserve was no longer covered by a continuous stretch of tropical rain forest due mainly to anthropological effects. The establishment of farms, villages and hamlets degraded the forest and reduced the number of loggable species thus threatening the survival of the whole forest reserve as an important ecological unit.|Thesis collection|Oluwa forest reserve/Ordination technique/anthropological effects/loggable species/ecological unit*||||||Orji, Ugochukwu Richards|M|An Evaluation Of Indigenous Technology Capability Building Of Automotive Spare Industry In SouthEastern Nigeria.  ||||||M.

It also assessed the local components production and developed management strategies to enhance a high output capacity in the industry.Purposive sampling approach was used to collect data from 15 auto-firms, one engineering servicing company, one research institute and three universities in the region  through questionnaire, oral interview, observation and existing records. Information on issues such as available capability, local input resources, production performance, innovation and linkages were obtained. The data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics.The study indicated that among the most common raw material inputs, non-ferrous metals were the most available locally (3.94) ,followed by plastic and rubber (2.55), while iron and steel (1.00), chemicals (1.00), fibre and paper (1.00) were mostly imported. Furthermore, 50% of the firms recycled scrap while 87.5% had the capability to design and develop metal extraction technology.The result further showed that the human skill for raw material processing was available (75%), while the availability of raw materials (37.5%) and processing plants (5%) were the limiting factors. Training of Nigerian technicians were mainly by attachment with foreign experts abroad and attachment with local experts (5% of firms). The acquired skills were applied to product quality improvement (100%), maintenance engineering (95%), and plant design and development of less complicated components (75%).The capability to design and produce one-stroke engine block existed in 38% of firms, while the limiting factors were caste-iron resources and machinery (100%), and technical skill (25%). About 66% of the firms developed the capability to design, manufacture and install up to 25% of their factory's plant and machinery components within 6years of commencing operation.The Nigerian Railway Corporation, Project Development Institute and the Metallurgical Department of Universities had the capability for consultancy, staff training, design and development of machinery and components, which could be used to develop the local automotive spare parts firms. Linkage characteristics of the firms were strong internally within firms (4.125); but weak with R&D institutions in Nigeria (0.25), other automotive firms (0.15), local iron and steel production industry (0.13), and international experts (0.13).The study concluded that some technological capabilities had been required by the automotive firms, and that this could be further enhanced by improving the linkage between the firms and R&D institutes, universities, and engineering service companies.|Thesis collection|scrap/metal extraction technology/caste-iron/automotive firms/local experts/processing plants.*||||||Opatola, Mustapha Olayiwola                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |M|The Role Of Herbs In Meeting The Needs Of The People Of Osun State, Nigeria ||||||M.Sc.

The ultimate objective was to assess the contributions of the herb sellers in meeting the health needs of the people of the State.The data for the study were collected from the herb sellers, members of the public (clients), and top government health officials. The sample population comprised 120 selected randomly registered herb sellers out of a population of 800 in the State's 3 senatorial districts, 240 members of the public (clients) also randomly selected, from the same senatorial districts, and 7 top health officials from the department of public health, Ministry of Health, Osogbo. The instrument used was a semi-structured questionnaires for the herb sellers, structured questionnaires for the clients, and in-depth interview for the health officials. The data collected were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The analyses were carried out using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS). The qualitative data were analyzed using the ZY index.The study revealed that the educational level of herb sellers had no significant effect on the client's patronage, (x2 = 4.666, df = 6, p- value =.587 p > 0.05). Seventy out of the 120(58.3%) had no formal education. The study also indicated that the resources of the herb sellers (the capital base, size of shop, volume of herbal commodities or wares) were significant in determining the level of the client's patronage (x2 =11.931, df = 2, p-value =0.003 p < 0.05). The study also showed that the socio-economic status ( e.g income group) of the clients had significant effect on their assessment of herb sellers' (x2 = 13.465, df =3, p- value = .004 p < 0.05). About 76% of the public indicated their satisfaction with herb seller's services and rated them highly. Again, the study showed that the socio-economic class of clients had a significant effect on the patronage of herb sellers (x2 = 17.225, df = 5, p-value = .004 p < 0.05 ), as most of the patronage of the herb sellers (60%) appeared to derive from clients of low socio-economic status. However, the different social categories of respondents (76.2%) rated herb sellers highly and expressed satisfaction with their services. Also, the general public (90%) appeared favourably disposed towards them. In fact, the public image of the herb sellers (99.2%) had risen considerably in spite of current expansion in orthodox medical services.The study concluded that herb sellers made some contributions to the health needs of the people of the state as their clientele increased over the years, possibly due to the affordability of their services by most of their clients|Thesis collection|herb sellers/client's patronage/income group/public image/orthodox medical services.*||||||Omondiagbe, Kayode Felix|M|Efficiency Of Conventional And Non- Conventional Pest Control Methods Used By Cacao Farmers In Osun State, Nigeria.||||||M.Sc.

It also analyzed the effectiveness of conventional pesticides vis-à-vis non-conventional ones, and compared the technical efficiency of the users of non-conventional pesticides to that of the users of conventional ones. The purpose was to assist smallholder farmers on the appropriate pest control strategy to adopt.The study covered cacao farmers registered with the 0yo-Osogbo Diocesan Catholic Agricultural Programme (OODAP). Data were obtained from three categories of farmers. These were farmers using non-conventional pest control methods only; farmers using conventional methods only; and farmers using both methods. One hundred and fifty cacao farmers were selected using a multi-stage random sampling technique and questionnaires were administered on them. Data collected were analyzed using partial budgetary, regression and stochastic frontier production techniquesThe results of partial budgetary analysis showed that indirect costs of pesticides' use raised the total variable costs by 32.3 percent, 41.1 percent and 20.7 percent for users of non-conventional pesticides,. conventional pesticides and both conventional and non-conventional pesticides respectively. A user of conventional pesticides could realize a gain of N1,736.50 per hectare in net profit if he switched to the use of non-conventional pesticides while a loss of N2,277. 10 per hectare would be recorded if he switched to the use of both conventional and non-conventional pesticides. The effectiveness estimate of pesticides revealed that non-conventional pesticides were more effective against pests when compared with the use of conventional pesticides, though both were overused.The results further revealed that the predicted efficiencies varied widely across farms, ranging from 6 percent to 100 percent with mean technical efficiency of 49 percent, allocative efficiency of 100 percent and economic efficiency of 49 percent for users of conventional pesticides, and 14 percent to 100 percent with mean technical efficiency of 58 percent, allocative efficiency of 73 percent and economic efficiency of 41 percent for users of non-conventional pesticides. Variables such as education, family size and farming experience had significant influence (P< 0.05) on the level of efficiency of the cacao farmers.It was concluded that cacao farmers were not efficient in the use of either conventional or non-conventional pesticide and there was considerable room for improvement in the productivity of the farms in the study area.|Thesis collection|conventional pesticides/cacao farmers/pest control strategy/allocative efficiency/partial budgetary.*||||||Omoniyi, Adesoji Olubunmi|F|A Study Of The Relative Effectiveness Of Learning Cycle And Concept Mapping Approaches For Correcting Students' Misconceptions In Chemistry||||||Ph.D. Curriculum Studies|Ehindero, O.

The study further investigated the interactive effects of the teaching approaches on the academic performance of high and low ability students with a view to providing a more appropriate approach for correcting students' misconceptions in chemistry.The study adopted a quasi pre-test-post-test experimental design with two levels of treatment and one control group. A total of 180 SSS Chemistry students from three schools were randomly selected to constitute the sample for the study. The students were assigned to experimental groups, Learning Cycle (68), Concept Mapping (63) and the Control Group (65). The control group was taught using the Traditional Lecture Method. A research instrument termed Chemistry Achievement Test (CAT), was developed by the researcher and ascertained for reliability (r = 0.78, p<0.05). The instrument was thereafter administered on subjects at pre-test and post-test levels. Data collected from pre-test and post-test administrations of the research instrument were analysed using t-test, one-way and two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and the Scheffe post-hoc Multiple Comparison Test.The results showed that the Learning Cycle Approach was the most effective (X = 11.88)compared to Concept Mapping (X = 11.53) and Traditional lecture methods (X = 10.47), F(2,177) = 7.12, p<0.05. Also, Concept Mapping Approach was more effective than the Traditional (Control) Method. Results of the interaction effect of the teaching approaches and level of performance of the low and high ability students indicated that the effectiveness of the teaching approaches did not depend on the performance level of the low and high ability students F(1,119) = 0.55, p>0.05. With regard to gender, results also showed that female respondents performed better (X = 12.65) than their male counterparts (X = 10.84) in the Learning Cycle Approach (t = 2.97,df = 58, p<0.05). However, male subjects performed significantly better (X=12.26) than females (X =11.08) when taught using the Concept Mapping Approach, (t = 2.25, df = 58, p<0.05).In conclusion, for effective teaching and learning of Chemistry in schools, the results indicated that the Learning Cycle Approach would make teaching and learning more effective than the Concept Mapping Approach.

Likewise, other compounds tested for comparison viz quercetin and dorsmanin F were extracted from D. mannii ; 6,8-diprenyleriodictyol and 4 hydroxylonchocarpin from D. prorepens and 6-prenyl-apigenin and isobavachalchone from D. zenkeri. The anti-trichomonal assay of the respective extracts and pure compounds were performed using cultured Trichomonas gallinarium which growth was monitored over 24 - 48 h, and their effectiveness compared with metronidazole. The minimum lethal concentration (MLC) was determined.The anti-oxidant activities of the extracts and compounds were also determined using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl(DPPH) free radical assay. The analgesic effects of the extracts were evaluated in three models of antinociceptive methods: acetic acid-induced abdominal contractions, hot-plate and tail-flick tests in mice. The anti-inflammatory effects of the extracts were carried out using three different models: oedema formation of mice right hind paw, pulmonary oedema and leucocytes count from the mice pleurisy. All test samples were administered intraperitoneally. The data obtained were analysed using Student t- test.D. barteri_twig had higher antitrichomonal activity (MLC=1.95ug/ml) than the leaf and was significantly more active (P< 0.05) than D. convexa leaf and twig and the standard metronidazole (MLC= 2.50 µg/ml). However, the isolated compounds were less active. Quercetin , bartericin A,  6,8  diprenyleriodictyol , dorsmanin F, 6 prenylapigenin and isobavachalcone had the same activity (MLC=31:25 µg/ml) which is higher than quercitrin, bartericin B, Stigmasterol (MLC=125µg/ml). D. convexa twig, amenthoflavone, gedunine , 4 -hydroxylonchocarpin had similar (500µg/ml) which is higher than D. convexa leaf (1000µg/ml) gave the lowest activity. Dorstenia barteri extracts and bartericin A , as well as quercitrin were the most active in the anti - oxidant assay. The leaf and twig extracts of D. barteri had significant (P<0.05) antinociceptive activities in chemical, mechanical and thermally induced pain tests. The extracts also showed notable and dose-related activities against acute inflammation in carrageenin- induced oedema paw weight and in the number of leucocytes. The effect of the twig extract was more than that of the leaves in all the models. The values obtained were comparable to the standard  drugs acetylsalicylic acid (100mg/kg) and phenylbutazone (100mg/kg).In conclusion, this study showed that these Dorstenia species exhibited remarkable activities in all the tests performed; D. barteri twig having the highest activity. Thus justifying the usefulness of Dorstenia species in the management of trichomonal infection, pain and inflammatory reactions as indicated in traditional medicine.|Thesis collection|Dorstenia barteri/pulmonary oedema/antitrichomonal/tail-flick tests/quercitrin/amenthoflavone*||||||Oluwole, Oluleke Olugbemiga|M|Prediction Of Solidification Behaviour And Defect Occurrence In Aluminium-Silicon-Magnesium Alloy Using Heat Conduction Models  ||||||Ph.

Using the Fourier equation and the explicit finite difference method, a computer code in C- programming language was written to simulate AlSi7wt%Mg solidifying in un-risered chilled steel, non-chilled steel and sand moulds. Solidification behaviour and defect occurrence in the alloy were predicted using temperature contours plotted from the results. From the analysis, a riser size to solve the shrinkage problem was obtained. The effect of the use of riser on solidification was simulated.The results showed that solidification times of 1.56 seconds, 3.12 seconds and 8.37 seconds were obtained for simulated 100cm x 70cm x 50cm plate solidifying in chilled steel mould, non-chilled steel mould and sand mould respectively. In un-risered castings, it was observed that apart from direct  chill casting where there was instant chill on metal  mould contact, solidification followed the pattern of heterogeneous nucleation. Nucleation started at the corners where heat extraction was fastest before proceeding to the sides of the casting. Further more extensive mushy zone layer was predominant causing extensive dendrite formation and segregation. The casting had the usual hot spot in the center. Defects predicted were center shrinkage cavity, hot tearing and interdendrite porosities in chilled castings. For non-chilled castings they were surface shrinkage cavities and interdendrite porosities. Inverse segregation of silicon rich solute and a rich center in magnesium were predicted in both chilled and non-chilled castings. In comparison, simulation in sand mould with an experimental sand casting showed close agreement. Simulated effect of riser calculated from the volume of the all mushy zone solved the problem of shrinkage cavities. Riser diameter of 6cm obtained from simulation for a 100cm x 60cm x 50cm casting tallied with calculation from riser diagram.In conclusion, riser obtained using the existing and the developed models provided effective tool to solve problems of shrinkage cavity and surface cavities in chilled and non-chilled castings.|Thesis collection|thermodynamic data/chilled steel mould/heterogeneous nucleation/interdentrite porosities/mushy zone*||||||Oluwole, Olufunke Oluwakemi.|F|The Cytogenic Characterization of The Nigerian Indigenous Pig.||||||M.

Mature pigs (20 ± 1.0 kg) were purchased from rural areas of Otan-Ile, Ilesa, Iwo and Ile-Ife. Chromosome spread was obtained from dividing white blood cells which were cultured for 72 hrs in 10 ml Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium supplemented with 20 mM HEPES buffer, 10% fetal serum and 1% phytohaemaglutinin.. Giemsa staining, Giemsa bands-Trypsin-Giemsa (GTG) and R bands-Heat Denaturation-Giemsa (RHG) chromosome banding techniques were applied. The chromosomes were examined by scanning the unbanded and banded slides for chromosomes under a light microscope. Metaphase cells with well spread chromosome complements were studied and the chromosomes counted and photographed. Karyotypic analysis based on the International System of Chromosome Nomenclature (ISCN) was done by examining sixty-two digital photographs of well spread metaphases to determine the modal chromosomal number of the NIP. The homologous pairs were correctly matched and arranged based on their morphology, centromeric position and banding patterns. Of the sixty-two well spread metaphases, ten (5 male, 5 female) were karyotyped. Means of chromosomal arm lengths, the p/q ratios, centromeric indices and total chromosomal lengths were obtained and used in the classification of the chromosomes. Karyograms showing size variation and morphology of the chromosomes were then plotted.Results showed that the modal chromosome number of the NIP was the same as that of exotic which is 2n = 38. Similarly, the nombre fondamental (NF) at 64 was the same for both. The chromosome arm ratios (p/q) of the NIP and the exotic pig were also observed to be the same in chromosome pairs 1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 12, 14-18 and the Y chromosome. However, differences were observed in arm ratios for chromosome pairs 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13 and the X chromosome. The difference was not enough to cause differentiation in the chromosome type. The X chromosome was submetacentric and had a p/q ratio of 0.25 while the exotic was metacentric with a p/q ratio of 0.66. The banding patterns appeared the same.In conclusion, the similarity between the NIP and the exotic showed a phylogenic relationship and the differences showed that the X chromosomes accounted for the physiological differences between the two.|Thesis collection|karyotype/phytohaemaglutinin/Metaphase cells/homologous pairs/submetacentric*||||||Taleatu, Bidini Alade|M|Preparation And Characterization Of Metal Organic Chemical Vapour Deposited Lithium Molybdenum Oxysulphide Thin Film||||||M.

The precursor was characterized using Infra red (IR) spectroscopy. The deposition of the film was done by pyrolysing the precursor on to soda lime glass substrates at a temperature of 350 °C for one hour. The deposited film was characterized using UV-visible spectrophotometry, Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) techniques.The characteristic absorption peaks of organic functional groups are evident in the IR spectrum of the precursor. The UV-visible spectrum of the film showed that the film has a direct allowed energy gap of 2.26 eV and the transition is not phonon assisted. The RBS technique showed that the deposited film is an extremely thin layer and its charging effect is very prominent. The colour of the film was used to estimate the thickness of the deposited film as 350.40 nm. The micrograph of the film carried out by SEM revealed that the deposited film is pinhole free and continuous with uniform crystal growth; the estimated average size of the grain was well below 5 microns.Finally, the pyrolysis of lithium molybdenum oxodithiocarbamate to obtain the lithium molybdenum oxysulphide thin film confirms the suitability of MOCVD technique for thin film deposition. The results obtained from the characterization showed that the film is potentially suitable to exhibit electrochromism which gives possible applications in display devices. It can also serve as a solar energy conversion material since its absorption lies in the visible region.|Thesis collection|lithium molybdenum/UV-visible spectrum/electrochromism/oxodithiocarbamate/soda lime*||||||Udofia, Sunday Sampson|M|The Compositional Techniques In Mkpon Ekpo Ritual Music Of The Annang Community Of Southern Nigeria||||||M.

The seedlings of DTPMFe+ were planted into a fenced plot 18 m x 4 m divided into four equal blocks. In the field population, the plants were seeded at a conventional spacing of 30 cm x 30 cm. The potted population was raised in ten 4-litres buckets in January 2002. The plants were seeded at rates of one plant per hill and two plants per hill in both populations. DTPMFe+ together with the parents (AWGU DWARF-W and IJ86-W) were seeded into five 4 -litres buckets each in May 2002. At maturity, detailed morphological characters were conducted for plants selected according to the IBPGR-IRRI Advisory Committee Descriptor for Rice (0ryza saliva L.).The pattern of protein distribution in the rice grains was determined according to the standard methods.In the field population there was significant difference in grain length and grain width, one plant per hill had higher values than two plants per hill. In the potted population there was significant difference in the number of spikelets, length of primary branches, number and length of secondary branches and panicle length. One plant per hill still showed higher values than two plants per hill. Low tillering (5 tillers) was observed on DTPMFe+ in the dry season of January 2002 and heavy tillering (28) in the wet season of May 2002. DTPMFe+ showed a selection gain over its parents in culm , panicle and spikelet characteristics The culm characteristics are plant height (dwarf, -44%), tillering (heavy, 44.60%), erect plant form, erect flag and all tiller bearing panicle. The panicle and spikelet characteristics are panicle length (long, 13.41%) and number of spikelets per panicle (dense, 144.1%), Caryopsis size (long and slender, 21.95% and - 15.42% respectively), maturity date (early, -32.12), awn less, synchronization of booting, and pattern of protein distribution. The cultivar had high concentration of protein, when compared with the parents, with fewer protein bodies in the aleurone layer. The transverse section through the caryopsis of DTPMFe+ showed large protein bodies scattered in the aleurone layer followed by a band of large, distinct protein bodies massively infiltrated by tiny protein bodies, which ramified into the core of the section.In conclusion, DTPMFe+, as an enhanced cultivar, is endowed with useful agronomic characteristics and the seeding rate of one plant per hill was found to be more effective than seeding rate of two plants per hill.|Thesis collection|rice cultivar/spikelets/heavy tillering/panicle length/Caryopsis size/aleurone layer*||||||Sonibare, Jacob Ademola|M|Computer-Based Modelling Of Gas Flare Emissions And Associated Downwind Effects In Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Chemical Engineering|Akeredolu, F.

It also explored alternative utilization options for Nigeria's associated natural gas for reduction of routine flaring in the country.Combustion reactions were modelled using mass balance equations. An algorithm was developed for combining those equations with input heat balance equations, packaged in FORTRAN 90, and used to simulate gaseous emissions, downwind concentrations and thermal radiation from natural gas flare. The package was validated with existing data from the literature and used to study the impact of gas flaring activities in the upstream petroleum operations in Nigeria. In addition to these, utilization options were proposed for effective elimination of routine flaring of associated natural gas in the country using daily energy requirements for domestic cooking and thermal electricity generation.The results showed that for the model developed, complete and incomplete combustions were the key reaction types. The complete combustion of "sweet" natural gas studied followed a linear relationship between the number of carbon atom and mole of air required (y = 1.4945x  + 0.5060) and for incomplete combustion, it was y = 1.24718x  + 0.2530. The same relationship was obtained for incomplete combustion of "sour" gas (y = 1.2493x  + 0.2516), where x and y are the respective number of carbon atom present in the natural gas and the mole of air required for combustion. Based on an annual gas flaring rate of 25838 m3, the gaseous emissions from natural gas of Nigerian origin predicted by the model averaged 1.72 x 105 kg, 5.48 x 105 kg, 1.61 x 105 kg, 2.25 x 105 kg, and 1.16 x 103 kg for CO2, CO, NO, NO2, and SO2, respectively. A safe-distance-from-flare-radiation was predicted to be between 65 and 75 m for the 6.31 kW/m2 against the recommended 60 m by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) in Nigeria. The study also established that for routine gas flaring to be eliminated in Nigeria, domestic market development for utilization of natural gas in cooking and electricity generation at thermal stations were good options. Consumption by homes in the 36 state capitals only, consumption by homes in the 36 state capitals and other cities with population > 40,000 each, and consumption by homes in the existing 11 districts of National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) could utilize between 1.6 and 3.6 % of natural gas flared could be consumed domestically for cooking. The balance amounting to about 68.4 - 69.9 million m3/day could be utilized by thermal electricity generation. This could lead to a total requirement of between 92 and 140 million m3/day of natural gas in the country. However, that represents only about 0.01 0.02 % of the domestic energy requirement predicted to be 0.92 quads per annum.In conclusion, this study showed that the carbon content of natural gas plays a prominent role in the determination of air quantity required for combustion while air availability was one of the factors that classify the combustion reaction type into "complete" or "incomplete". The natural gas heating value was also found to be an important factor, affecting both gaseous emission composition and thermal radiation.|Thesis collection|FORTRAN 90/gas flare/carbon atom/thermal electricity/natural gas/Petroleum resources*||||||Sowemimo Abimbola Adepetu|F|Toxicity And Mutagenic Potentials Of Selected Southwestern Nigerian Medicinal Plants Used In The Management Of Cancer||||||Ph.

In addition, compounds responsible for the activity in a candidate plant were isolated so as to explain the rationale behind the observed activity.The plants were macerated in ethanol and the respective extracts obtained together with relevant standards were tested on three assay models. These are the standard brine shrimp lethality tests, the standard antitelomerase tests with standard oligopeptides as control, and the adapted rat lymphocyte cytotoxicity tests with methotrexate, cyclophosphomide, cinchonidine and strychnine as controls. The lethal dose (LD50) to brine shrimp nauplii were estimated using the Finney computer programme while the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the telomerase enzyme was read from the gel electrophoretic chromatograms. The gross chromosomal aberrations in rat bone marrow cell smears after intraperitoneal administration of extracts were compared with those of the positive standards and described. The ethanolic extract of the selected candidate plant was fractionated in antitelomerase directed phytochemical investigation using various chromatographic techniques including ion exchange, paper, thin layer and cellulose column.The compounds isolated were characterised using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.The results showed that nine plant parts out of seventeen tested were toxic to brine shrimp nauplii. The ranking of the plants showed that the activity of Bryophyllum pinatum> Annona senegalensis> Garcinia kola> Hymenocardia    acida> Spondiathus  preussi> Morinda lucida> Erythrophleum suaveolens> Nymphaea lotus> Chrysophyllum albidum> Hibiscus sabdariffa> Chenopodium ambroisoides>Ficus exasperata. All plant extracts tested on rat lymphocytes were mutagenic except hibiscus sabdariffa, Chenopodium ambrosioides and Ficus exasperate. The types of aberrations observed in chromosomal smears were chromosomal disjunction, breakages, arm shortening and plebbing. The active plants using the M1C values in the antitelomerase assay can be ranked as follows Chenopodium ambrosoides> Bryophyllum pinnatum> Nymphaea lotus> Morinda lucida > Garcinia kola >Annona senegalensis > S'pondiathus preussi> Hymenocardia acida> Chrysophyllum albidum > Erythrophleum suaveolens> Ficus exasperata > Hibiscus sabdariffa. C. ambrosioides was only active against the human telomerase enzyme. Out of the four most active plants, Nymphaea lotus has not been previously implicated in any cytotoxicity assay and was chosen as the candidate plant. The antitelomerase activity directed fractionation of the N. lotus extracts led to the isolation of 8 amino acids (Leucine, D and L Isoleucine, aspartic acid, phenylalanine, tyrosine, threonine and valine), 2 non-protein amino acids (2-amino-7-octanoic acid and 2-amino butyric acid) and 2 alkanoic acids (butanoic acid and 4-butanoic acid).The study showed that the nine of the plants were cytotoxic and mutagenic and were not selective in their toxicity. However, those likely to have anticancer activity were identified as Chenopodium ambrosioides, Bryophyllum pinnatum, Nymphaea lotus, Morinda lucida and Garcinia kola. The compounds responsible for the antitelomeraseactivity of N. lotus was shown to be essentially amino acids. The results also justified the inclusion of these plants in herbal recipes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |Thesis collection|anticancer agents/brine shrimp/telomerase enzyme/Garcinia kola/cytotoxicity/Ficus exasperata*||||||Akinlo, Olayinka Olufisayo|F|The Economics Of Rotating Savings And Credit Associations In Osun State, Nigeria.||||||M.

Specifically, it determined the perception and identified the characteristics of people participating in the programme. It also analysed the various factors affecting ability and desire to participate in ROSCAs. This was with a view to accounting for the wide spread patronage of ROSCAs.Primary data were obtained from six towns in Osun state between November 2005 and January 2006. The study adopted stratified random sampling technique in selecting the towns from which the samples were drawn. Data were obtained from the respondents (240 in number) by the use of questionnaires. Data were analysed and processed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The descriptive statistics used were percentages and tables while the inferential statistics involved the estimation of two single equation model using both the ordinary least square and logit regression.The study revealed that 57% of the participants in ROSCAs were women showing that more women participated in the programme than men. Majority of the respondents earned below N20, 000 ($153.85) per month which indicated that most participants were low and middle income earners. In addition, it was found that 78.8% of those interviewed were highly educated and that 60.2% were public sector workers. This contradicted the assertion that only the poor, uneducated and semi-educated people participated in ROSCAs as indicated in the literature. The average number of ROSCAs participant was calculated as 15. The logit regression revealed that there were two major variables that affected participation in ROSCAs. These were length of marriage and monthly earnings. As monthly earnings increased, there was greater tendency for people to participate in ROSCAs whereas as length of marriage increased, the tendency to participate in ROSCAs declined. The regression analysis showed that there were three major determinants of the amount an individual saved in ROSCAs. These were monthly earnings (t = 8.32, P < 0.05), age of respondent (t = 2.064, P < 0.05) and length of marriage (t = -1.987, P < 0.05). It showed that the higher the monthly earnings, the higher the amount saved and that the amount saved in ROSCAs tended to increase with age. However, length of marriage was found to be significant but negative in its effect on the size of contribution by participants. The study further showed that over 85% of the participants utilised their contributions for investment and to purchase durable goods such as household items; evidence that ROSCAs could be growth enhancing.The study concluded that participation in ROSCAs paid off for the participants and hence increased patronage of diverse groups cutting across levels of education, sex, marital status and age.|Thesis collection|ROSCAs/sector workers/logit regression/monthly earnings/household items/investment.              /*||||||Alawode, Olubunmi Olanike|F|Analysis Of Agricultural Land Acquisition By Migrant Farmers In Ile-Oluji/Oke-Igbo Local Government Area Of Ondo State.||||||M.Sc.

It also predicted the future development of rural land acquisition within the area of study. This was with a view to understanding the administrative procedure in land acquisition in the study area.Primary data were generated from a cross-sectional survey of two hundred respondents (100 migrant farmers and 100 landowners) randomly selected from fourteen selected towns\villages. Also, twenty-eight key informants (two from each selected town\village) were interviewed. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain information from the farmers while an interview guide with open-ended questions was used to obtain information from the key informants. Descriptive statistics and the Markov Chain Model were used to analyse the data collected.The findings showed the dominance of the customary land tenure system among the indigenous farmers. Virtually, all the plots farmed by the indigenous farmers (96.36%) were acquired through inheritance. The most prominent type of access gained to land, by migrant farmers (69.49%) was through leasehold. Other forms of access to land by migrant farmers were through rent (20.90%) and purchase (9.60%). The number of plots involved in transactions was 41% of the total number of plots studied. From the Markov chain analysis, lease prices would range from N12,000 to N60,000 for farmlands ranging from 0.20ha to 6.0ha. Also, purchase prices would range from N23,000 to N52,000 for farmlands ranging from 0.21ha to 2.12ha in the next sixty years (2065). It was also observed that in the long run, rented farmlands would have increased from 8% to 95% thereby changing leased lands to rentals.It was concluded that agricultural land acquisition transactions allocated land from land-surplus but less productive landowners to land-deficient but more productive migrant farmers. Agricultural lands in the study area were acquired through the process of lease, rent and purchase system. The customary tenure systems provided relative security in terms of rights to farmers who had acquired land within the system|Thesis collection|Markov Chain/leasehold/rented farmlands/tenure arrangements/Agricultural land acquisition*||||||Agbato, Samson Efuwape|M|A Study Of Formal Land Transactions In Lagos State||||||M.Sc.

Three low-income scheme sites comprising Ikorodu Government Reservation Area (G.R.A.) III (295), Rose Gardens (340) and Isheri North Scheme (372) and three high-income schemes sites comprising Abijo G.R.A. (265), Lekki Phase 11 (215) and Ikeja G.R.A. (240) were selected using stratified random sampling. In addition, interviews were conducted on six (6) senior land officials in the State Land Bureau. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics.The results showed that 53.69% of the lands within the study area were acquired by government. Out of the acquired land, 33.75% had been used for agricultural schemes and 0.12% for industrial purposes. Only 5.72% had been used for residential/commercial schemes while 55.92% had not been committed to any use. The remaining 4.6% had been used for other purposes such as, roads, open spaces and recreational uses. The results of the interview also showed that methods of land transactions included direct allocation through site and services scheme, bulk allocation to private developers and regularization of rights to land in government acquired areas. The requirements for land allocation ranged from submission of duly completed application form, four survey plans, electronic tax clearance certificate, land information, purchase receipt, development levy to payment of all land charges. Submitted applications were processed and successful applicants were issued with letters of allocation. The results also showed that it was cheaper to get land through regularization of rights to land in government acquired areas than direct allocation. The costs for direct allocation, per plot, were between N200,000 and N300,000 for low-income scheme sites and between N3,000,000 and N6,700,000 for high-income scheme sites whereas the costs for regularization on low-income sites ranged from N130,000 to N200,000 and on high-income sites from N400,000 to N500,00. The results showed that 44% of the responding allotees agreed that government bureaucracy was one of the factors affecting land transactions negatively. Other factors included corruption in high places (11.61%), lack of information (7.50%), costly procedure (20.60%), issue of double allocation (10.70%) and delayed certification (5.60%). The result also showed that the allotees agreed that government bureaucracy had the greatest contribution to the problems of land transaction. This factor ranked first with a mean value of 3.56 on a 4-point scale. Costly procedure ranked second with a mean value of 3.15, while corruption in high places and the practice of double allocation by land officials ranked third and fourth with mean values of 3.24 and 3.15 respectively.The study concluded that the present system of land allocation by the public agencies was inefficient and inequitable.|Thesis collection.|allotees/State Land Bureau/low-income sites/costly procedure/Lekki Phase II*||||||Eyeh, Stephen Obruthe|M|Semiotics As A Tool For The Interpretation Of Major Themes In  Selected West African Novels||||||M.Phil.

Three of the novels were originally written in English, one was written in Yoruba, and three were English translations of French texts. The choice of the texts was heuristic.The result showed that the novels were narrated in a spatiotemporal context, and the accretion of meaning was made possible by certain recurrent mnemonic images and signs. It was also revealed that the quest for knowledge ran through all the novels, but the means and purpose of knowledge acquisition differed from one text to another. Initiation, story telling, formal education, and travel were some of the means through which knowledge was imparted. Each novel was a compendium of signs and symbols. Every animal, character, costume, gesture, statement, ideal, movement, object, relationship and situation functioned as a sign that gave an insight into such aspects of the novel as characterization, language, plot, setting and theme. Two totems, the little black snake and the crocodile, symbolized the animist foundation of the African culture represented in The African Child .The protagonist's departure to France in quest of Western education signified a rupture in cultural continuity and constituted a source of alienation. Medza's movement from Vimili to Kala was a journey from ignorance  to knowledge of the coherence and vitality of the indigenous African culture and the deracinating effects of colonialism and Western education on the culture. Expedition to the Mount of Thought signified the transition from orality to literacy and elucidated advantages of writing. Each of the eight characters on a journey in the novel symbolized a virtue, vice or vocation. The journey itself was allegorical. It was emblematic of the journey of every human being from birth through vicissitudes of life to death and afterlife. Sickness was portrayed in The Concubine as a loss of cosmic, physical, psychological, moral and spiritual harmony, and healing took a correspondingly holistic approach. The physical movement by Densu from Esuano to the Eastern forest in The Healers was symbolic of his rejection of European imperialism, evil and slavery and the desire for healing through liberation from thralldom. In God's Bits of Wood, the mass movement of women from Thies to Dakar in support of the striking railway workers was for freedom from capitalist exploitation.The study concluded that semiotics permeated all fields of human endeavour and was a highly rewarding critical approach to literary study.|Thesis collection|semiotic approach/spatiotemporal/allegorical/Esuano/protagonist's/The Concubine*||||||Alabi, Jimoh Kayode|M|An Assessment Of The Performance Of Private Housing Estate Developers In Lagos State||||||M.Sc.

The study covered all the nine (9) developers that registered with Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) in Lagos State. Two hundred and fifty five (255) out of the total two thousand five hundred and forty seven (2,547) housing units developed by all the developers were selected using systematic sampling. From the records of housing units in the estate of the developers, every tenth was selected. Data were analysed with the use of descriptive statistics and the Relative Importance Index (RIl) analysis.The results showed that all the PHEDs were domestic investors and that 67% of them had been in the housing construction business for over ten years. Sixty seven percent (67%) of the PHEDs were investor developers, while 22% of them were merchant developers. In addition, while all of the PHEDs sourced funds for development from FMBN, another 20% and 80% sourced funds from Commercial banks and Internal sources respectively. The result of the occupiers' assessment of the general performance of the PHEDs showed that 68% of the occupiers rated their performance good. Also, from the occupiers assessment, the result of the Relative Importance Index (Rll) showed that "kitchen" ranked first among the in-house facilities/services provided with RII of 0.81. "location of rooms", roof quality", "natural daylight brightness" and "privacy within residence" ranked second with RII of 0.80. The assessment of neighbourhood environmental facilities/services showed that "type of people in the neighbourhood", "neighbourhood location" and "reputation of the area" ranked first with RII of 0.80 while "neighbourhood security," "people's impression about PHEDs houses" and "air pollution in the area" ranked second with RII of 0.79. The results of the assessment on the average, showed that 59% of the occupiers agreed that in -house facilities were good. Also 61 % of them agreed that neighbourhood environmental facilities were good. The results of the RII showed that "accessibility to financial facilities" ranked first among the factors influencing the performance of the PHEDs with RII of 0.52, while "Cost of building materials" and "cost of labour" ranked second with RII of 0.48 The study concluded that the performance of PHEDs in Lagos State was generally good.|Thesis collection|PHEDS/Motgage/domestic investors/merchant developers/roof quality/internal sources*||||||Aladekomo, Florence Olanrewaju|M|An Assessment Of Loan Recovery Strategies In Community Banks In Osun State||||||M.Phil, Business Administration|Oribabor, P.

Stratified random sampling technique was employed to ensure that the three senatorial districts in Osun state namely, Osun East, Osun West and Osun Central were adequately covered. Primary data were obtained from questionnaires and interview guide administered to senior bank officials and customers. Overall the sample consisted of twenty eight (28) community bank managers or their representatives. Also one hundred and twelve(112) loan recipients (4 per branch) were purposively selected to include loanees who paid back their loans and those who defaulted. Secondary data were collected from budget speech, community bank newsletters, and National Board of Community Banks reports. Descriptive statistics was employed in analyzing the data.The results revealed that there was a clear understanding of the loan recovery techniques by the customers. Responses from bank officials revealed that 93% of the customers were informed about the loan recovery techniques before loan was released while 92.5% of loan recipients confirmed that they had clear understanding of the loan recovery techniques. Analysis the responses from the senior bank officials revealed that demand for collateral was the most adopted technique (71%) whilst community sanction was the least adopted (18%). The study revealed that bank officials rated demand for collateral as the most effective (64%) while reserve fund (18%) was rated as the least effective. In contrast, bank customers rated demand for collateral (44.6%) as the most effective whilst group lending (30.4%) and court action (21.4%) were rated as the least effective. The mean rank analysis of the effectiveness of the loan monitoring techniques revealed that visits to customers' premises came first with 68% followed by keeping watch over customers accounts (61%) while follow-up by telephone (21%) was ranked as the least effective. The study also revealed that other factors which included general poor capital base of clients, diverse group interests and lack of cooperation militated against the effectiveness of loan recovery strategies whilst inadequate facilities like transportation and communication reduced the effectiveness of loan monitoring.The study concluded that the loan recovery and monitoring techniques of community banks in Osun State were generally not effective, however, demand for collateral was rated as the most effective.|Thesis collection|loan recipients/budget speech/loan recovery/collateral/reserve fund/court action*||||||Ajayi, Adesola Adetutu|F|A Study On Polygalacturonase And Cellulase Enzymes In Tomato Fruits (Lycopersicon Esculentum Mill.)

The present work examined the production and the roles of polygalacturonase and cellulase enzymes during the deterioration of tomato fruits by Rhizopus arrhizus Fisher and Aspergillus flavus Linn.Healthy ripe tomato fruits were inoculated with mycelial discs containing spores of R.. arrhizus and A. flavus. Extraction of enzymes produced in the inoculated tomato fruits after ten days of incubation was carried out by homogenizing with chilled liquid extractant using the MSE homogeniser. The isolated enzymes were partially purified by a combination of ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. The effects of a number of factors such as the temperature, heat, pH, substrate concentration, chemicals and cations, on activities of the enzymes were investigated. The molecular weights of the enzyme fractions were also determined.The results showed that the optimum temperature for the activities of the enzymes produced by the two fungi was 40°C except for the polygalacturonase from R. arrhizus which had an optimum of 35°C. Maximum activities of cellulase and polygalacturonase from A. flavus occurred at pH 5.0 and pH 4.5 respectively. The polygalacturonase from R. arrhizus exhibited maximum activity at pH 4.5. The activities of the enzymes produced by the two fungi were stimulated to varying degrees by Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ but inhibited by ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), mercuric chloride (HgC12) and 2,4 -Dinitrophenol (DNP). The enzymes were highly susceptible to heat, losing all their activities within thirty minutes of heating at 70°C. The substrate concentration at half maximum velocity (km values) for the hydrolysis of carboxymethylcellulose by A. flavus cellulase fractions were 16.7 and 15.4mg/ml while the values of 4.2, 2.6 and 2 mg/ml were obtained for the hydrolysis of pectin by A . flavus polygalacturonase fractions. Furthermore, km values of 3.8, 2.8 and 2.9 mg/ml were obtained for the hydrolysis of pectin. The molecular weights of the enzyme fractions obtained from a. flavus were approximately 138,000 datons and 30,200 daltons while those from R. arrhizus were approximately 166,000 daltons and 60,260 daltons. It was observed that the crude fractions and the partially purified enzyme preparations obtained from A . flavus and R. arrhizus during the deterioration of tomato fruits caused tissue maceration and cellular death of potato tissues!In conclusion, the occurrence of polygalacturonase and cellulolytic enzymes in tomato tissues infected by A . flavus and R. arrhizus and the absence of the enzymes in the non-infected tissues strongly suggests a role for these enzymes in the infection process.|Thesis collection|carboxymethylcellulose/Rhizopus arrhizus/polygalacturonase/tissue maceration/MSE homogeniser*||||||Abrifor, Chiedu Akporaro|M|Teachers' Perception On The Effectiveness Of Physical Punishment In Selected Secondary Schools In Ile-Ife, Osun State.||||||M.Sc.

This was with a view of exploring the effects of physical punishment in encouraging or discouraging students' from delinquent and violent acts.The primary data for the study were collected from teachers in 12 purposively selected secondary schools in Ile-Ife. A sample of 230 respondents was selected using the simple random sampling technique. The data collected were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics particularly chi-square, t-test, and One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The analyses were carried out using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The qualitative data collected through In-depth Interviews and Focus Group Discussions (FGD) were analysed using the TextBase Beta.The study identified nine different types of disciplinary measures adopted in the selected secondary schools in Ile-Ife. The study also revealed that the teachers' perceived physical punishment as an effective disciplinary measure. It further showed that secondary school teachers perceived physical punishment as the most readily available method of improving the standard of discipline, in order to maintain conducive learning environment among students. The study also showed that the teachers perceived referring students to the school's guidance and counselling unit and calling in student's parents/guardians were equally effective measures. The study further revealed that there was no significant relationship (P.748 = P < 0.05, P.214 = P < 0.05, P.161 = P < 0.05, P.243 = P < 0.05 and P.423 = P < 0.05 respectively) between teachers' personal attributes such as (age, sex, teacher's rank, level of education and marital status) and their perception on the effectiveness of physical punishment. Also, the length of service of teachers had no significant influence (P .713 = P < 0.05) on teachers' perception on the effectiveness of physical punishment in the selected schools. Also, there was no significant relationship (P.796 = P < 0.05) between teachers' perception on the effectiveness of physical punishment and its frequent adoption as a disciplinary measure.In conclusion, physical punishment was perceived as an effective disciplinary measure for correcting and maintaining discipline among secondary school students as well as, in molding and shaping their cognitive and psychosocial growth and development.|Thesis collection|violent acts/Focus Group/physical punishment/disciplinary measure/psychosocial growth*||||||Abolade, Surajudeen Olamide|M|Family Structure And Adolescent Deliquency In Ifo Local Government Area Of Ogun State, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The National Population Commission Enumeration Areas (EAs) frame in Ifo LGA was used to select the respondents that participated in the study. Sixteen enumeration areas were selected randomly from the EAs sample frame. In each of the selected EAs, 25 eligible respondents were selected and interviewed through the use of systematic random sampling technique. Focus group discussion (FGD) were also conducted to derive an in-depth knowledge on how family structure affected the behavior of the children. Three levels of data analyses were employed. At the multivariate level, the logistics regression model was used to estimate odds ratios for each of the indicators of delinquent behaviour considered in the analyses.The study showed that 80.4% of the parents visited their children in school, 69.3% said they monitored the TV programmes and movies that their children watched while 89.8% of the respondents controlled the types of clothes and hairstyles their children wear, the study revealed that 66.6% of those who claimed that their children smoke were from non-intact families while 26.7% were from monogamous families, 49.5% of respondents who reported that their children fight with neighbors were from non-intact families, while 40.4% were from monogamous families. It was found that children from non-intact families were more prone to indicators of delinquent behaviour considered than children born to intact families.The odds ratios from the multivariate analysis showed that children from intact families were 0.130 less likely to smoke, 0.534 less likely to have child outside wedlock and 0.855 less likely to fight with neighbours than children from non-intact families (P<0.05). On the other hand, children from non-intact families were 2 times more likely than their counterparts to drink alcohol and 2.347 more likely to be accused of stealing. This confirmed that family cohesion had an important effect on adolescent delinquency.It was recommended that, effort at controlling delinquent behavior should be focused on the cohesion of the family unit as the medium through which moral values can be instilled into the hearts of the children. Also, the traditional systems of marriage where the extended family pays the bride prices and could mediate among couples during difficult period needs to be strengthened so that the rate of divorce and separation could be reduced in the society.In conclusion, the cohesion of the family unit helped children to have proper upbringing both emotionally and psychologically. This helped children to easily conform to societal norms and values, which help prevent delinquent behavior in children|Thesis collection. |adolescent deliquency/hairstyles/monogamous/intact families/family structure/divorce      *||||||Awopetu, Emmanuel Olajide|M|An Evaluation Of The Descriptive Approach On Presentation And Practice Of English Language Grammatical Items In Senior Secondary Schools In

This was with a view to comparing performance and staff composition of the civil service under different administrations prior to the adoption of the principle of federal character (1960-1978) and after (1979-2000).Primary and secondary data were utilized for the study. Primary data were collected through questionnaires and personal interviews. Copies of the questionnaires were administered on purposively six selected Federal Ministries and Commission and officers on GL 08 and above that were purposively selected. The ministries and commission were: Defence; Foreign Affairs; Finance; Internal Affairs; National Planning and Employment Labour and Productivity. Eight hundred and four (804) senior officers were randomly selected from the population of eight thousand and forty (8,040). This represents 10 percent of the total population. Out of the eight hundred and four (804) questionnaires distributed, 770 (95.5%) were retrieved. Interviews were also conducted to seek information from the current Head of Service of the federation (HOSF), and some key officers of the Federal Civil Service to elicit information on policy making and implementation as regards staffing process. Secondary data were obtained from official documents and publications especially from the Federal Civil Service Commission and the Federal Character Commission. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.The results showed that the principles and factors that influenced staffing process in the Nigerian Federal Civil Service were significantly different between the two periods of 1960-1978 and 1979-2000, as ethnicity, culture and ethno-regional political competition were more pronounced in staffing process in the FCS during the period of 1960-1978 than that of 1979-2000. (x2= 613.390; p < 0.05) This was due to the gravity of the socio-political factors in the power game played by the various leaders and the ethno-regional rivalry for supremacy of one ethnic group over the other in matters of appointments. It was also discovered that the political and social factors in the staffing process were significantly different between the periods under review as it affected the performance of staff in the service (x2 = 549.359; p < 0.05). Higher civil servants enjoyed a considerable measure of personal judgment and initiative, which enhanced their performance and decision making process most especially during the period of 1960-1978 as against 1979-2000 when there was a decline in their performance as staffing process did not receive adequate attention during this period. The study further revealed that there was significant difference in the extent of the representativeness of the component units of the federation in the FCS between the periods of 1960-1978 and 1979-2000 (x2 = 622.995; p < 0.05) as it was more pronounced in the period of 1979-2000 than 1960-1978. The national policy on federal character during the period of 1979-2000 made it mandatory for the ethnic groups of the federation to be represented in all government business. It also showed that the various criteria used in the staffing process in the FCS between the periods of 1960-1978 and 1979-2000 were different ( x2 = 598.367; p < 0.05). For instance, the use of merit was more profound in staffing process during the period of 1960-1978 than 1979-2000. Federal character principle, which allowed for adequate representation of every ethnic group, was used as a criterion for staffing process in the FCS during the period of 1979-2000.The study concluded that the adoption of the principle of federal character 1979-2000 in the staffing process of the Nigerian Federal Civil Service has been able to unify more the multi-ethnic groups in making all major decisions affecting the destiny of the country when compared to prior its adoption 1960-1978. |Thesis collection|staffing process/Federal character/National planning/Foreign Affairs/personal judgement/Employment Labour*||||||Agunlejika, Oluwafunmilayo|F|Modelling And Visual Display Of Wave Propagation Between The Ground Surface And An Altitude Of 5000 KM.||||||M.Sc.

Existing profiles were broken into segments, the line of best fit that well defined each segment of the EDP were identified and appropriate equations for these segments were developed. The equations were tested with random values from International Telecommunication Union Recommendations (ITU-R). The refractivity at different heights was calculated and the Snell's law was then applied in tracing out the ray path.The result showed that the equations developed generated profiles that are in close agreement with the EDPs of the ITU. For example, equation ñ= 3 x 1011 e 0.0042h for the range165 < h < 300km gives the maximum electron density of 1012 electrons per cubic meter at altitude 300 km above the earth surface. This density is in agreement with the ITU's peak electron density, which occurs in the F2 layer of the ionosphere. In the troposphere, the refractivity with respect to the height decreased exponentially from 315.0000 on the earth surface to 0.3531 at 50 km height. Refraction of the wave was found to be substantially independent of the frequency at the high frequency range. The angle of refraction reduces with height and the elevation angle error was found to increase with the altitude. A program developed in this study generates a computer interface where parameters such as frequency, angle of propagation, time of the day, and surface refractivity can be varied. It also generates the angle of refraction at each kilometer height and displays the path of the ray from the earth surface to an altitude of 5000 km.In conclusion, the results of this work can serve as a tool for the microwave and satellite engineers in the design of various types of links.|Thesis collection|troposphere/satelite engineers/surface refractivity/maximum electron/radio signals/Telecommunication.*||||||Ayoola, Murtala Ajayi.|M|Low-Level  Jets And Windshear Occurrences Over West Africa: An Implication For Aircraft Safety||||||M.

The analysis included the application of Nieuwstadt's equation, Bonner's criteria alongside the computer software applications such as Origin vs 7.1 and Matlab vs 6.5The results of the available upper air and planetary boundary layer (PBL) data revealed the occurrence of some major jets. These occurred in both the troposphere and the lower stratosphere. Major low-level jet streams were located on daily basis and always in the same geographical area in the troposphere. The jet was a narrow region of relatively strong winds located mostly in the lower troposphere. Pronounced low-level jet streams were located at about 500 hpa and 650-700 hpa pressure levels. The heights attained by the jets range from 1.5 km, 3km, 6km, 9 km and 12 km during most of the periods of occurrence. The wind of about 500 hpa helped to "steer" atmospheric storms. The troposphere was seen to be a significant layer in this study because 80% of the atmosphere's mass were located within it and almost all of what we called "weather" occurred in the troposphere. The average position of jet stream and intensity varied with the seasons. The level of jet cases as noticed in November to February was nearer the upper troposphere unlike what was obtained in the wet (rain) season where 80 % of the low-level jet occurrences were within the lower troposphere. During the dry period, the low-level jet cases were prominent at about 650-900 hpa pressure levels. More than 50 % of the jet cases greater or equal to 30 ms-1 [ V>30 ms-1]  occured at about 500 hpa pressure level.The study concluded that strong air in motion (LLJ) might be present near a well developed zone and the 500 hpa pressure level was essentially important for weather forecasting.|Thesis collection|windshear/low-level jets/stratosphere/planetary/Bonner's criteria/"steer"*||||||Agbonlahor, 'Mure Uhunamure|M|Determinants Of Child Farm Labour In Rural Households Of Ogun State, Nigeria. ||||||Ph.D. Agricultural Economics|Adeyemo, R.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria   |OBafemi Awolowo University, Agricultural Economics|2006|||OAU|||||xiv, 174p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The household survey involves an interview of each household head and a total of 594 children (7-17 years) from the households. Focus Group Discussion sessions were held in four locations. Primary data were collected from the respondents using semi-structured questionnaire. Data were collected on characteristics of the children such as school/farm involvement and intensities, on-farm-time involvement/allocation on both household's and in paid employment. Information on household characteristics and crop farm activities were collected from household heads. The censored Tobit model was used to ascertain the determinants of child farm labour intensity in the study area, while, the linear programming model was used to develop an optimal arable crop farm plan that maximizes economic returns to the farmers. Allowance was made for maximum school attendance and involvement of children. The t-statistic was used to determine significant differences in gender relations of child farm labour.The study revealed that an average of 5.3 hours of school time, representing about 17 percent of total school time was spent on farm activities. It was revealed that children started assuming household and farm responsibilities as early as age four and on the average they contributed about 23 hours of labour per week to farm work alone. It was also observed that the child's personal characteristics did not affect involvement in child farm labour. Household heads' socio-economic variables (educational status, farm income, size of farmland and value of total households' durable assets) and school distance from homes were found to be significant determinants of intensity of involvement in child farm labour. The study also revealed that while there were no significant difference between male and female children involvement in child farm labour (p < 0.05), there were significant differences in the farm work involvement by activities and duration of time spent. The optimal farm plan model revealed that a restructuring of the crop enterprise plan could increase the annual farm income by about 15 percent, while at the same time minimizing the child farm labour involvement in the study area.In conclusion, a significant part of school time was sacrificed for farm labour, there was no differences between male and female children hours spent on farm activities, and that it was possible to reduce child farm labour while at the same time increase the economic returns to arable crop farming in the state.|Thesis collection|Focus Group/farm labour/Tobit model/crop enterprise/child/household*||||||Aderogba, Adebayo Abiodun|M|The Effects Of Variable Viscosity On Steady Flows In A Slab  ||||||M.

Solutions to non-dimensionalized coupled velocity and temperature equations under Couette and Poiseuille flows were obtained in order to determine the effects of the Brinkman number (Br) and pressure gradient parameter (F) for the flow fields with the aim of demonstrating a variety of physical response embodied in variable viscosity for related industrial applications.The study was based on the use of continuity, Navier-Stokes and energy equations with appropriate boundary conditions leading to Couette and Poiseuille flows under the three viscosity-temperature models. Invoking the condition for incompressibility for unidirectional flow, the continuity equation dropped out and the remaining coupled equations were reduced to dimensionless form. The methods of solutions employed to solve the velocity and energy equations in this thesis were: Analytical; Regular Perturbation and Numerical, employing standard Maple interactive Ordinary Differential Equations solver. In the simple case of constant-type viscosity fluids. the equations were decoupled. The velocity equation was solved analytically and the result was substituted into the temperature equation which was also solved analytically. Furthermore, in the special case of Reynold's-type and Arrhenius-type viscosity fluids, the equations were coupled. Invariably, the velocity equations were integrated once and the resulting velocity gradients were substituted into the temperature equations. In the former viscosity case, exact solution weas provided to the autonomous, non-linear. second order differential equation of temperature for Couette flow while in the latter perturbation solution was provided to the equation. These were substituted into the velocity gradient equation and solved for velocity. For the Poiseuille flow case. the equations were non-autonomouos and not amenable to exact solutions. Hence, three-term series perturbation solutions were developed. The solutions for the temperature equations were substituted into the velocity equations and the velocities were thereby determined.The results showed that, for all the cases considered, 1% increase in Br increased the temperature by 1%. The Br did not affect the velocity in constant-type viscosity fluids but an increase in this parameter gave rise to an ogive shaped velocity profile for Reynold's-type viscosity fluids undergoing Couette flow. Also, for Arrhenius-type viscosity fluids undergoing Couette flow, as Br increased by 1%, velocity between Y=0 and Y=0.5 decreased by 10-4% while velocity above Y=0.5 increased by 10-5%. For Poiseuille flow case, 1% increase in Br increased the velocity for Reynold's-type viscosity fluid by 10-5% while it decreased the velocity for Arrhenius-type viscosity fluid by 10-5%. Moreover, increase in A increased both velocity and temperature by 2.5%.In conclusion, this study revealed that temperature had greater effect on the Arrhenius-type viscosity fluids compared to the Constant-type and Reynold's-type viscosity fluids|Thesis collection|Couette/Poiseuille/Brinkman/mathematical models/Reynold's-type/Navier-Stokes*|||||| Badaru, Abimbola Opeyemi|F|A Study Of Animal Manure For Bioremediation Of Crude Oil Contaminated Soil. ||||||M.

The control set-ups consisted of soil artificially oil-contaminated without manure, uncontaminated soil with 2% (w/w) poultry droppings as well as the uncontaminated soil with 2% (w/w) of cow dung. The microbial growth of both heterotrophic and hydrocarbon degrading bacteria and fungi was monitored using the serial dilution and pour plate method. The percentage amount of crude oil that was degraded in the soil was measured gravimetrically and the amount of carbon (iv) oxide (CO2) evolved per day was estimated by using a biometer flask with sidearm to absorb the CO2 produced.The oil-contaminated soil plus poultry droppings had the highest average population of heterotrophic bacteria of 9.3 x 107 cfu/g and hydrocarbon degrading bacteria of 4.5x107 cfu/g, while the oil-contaminated soil plus cow dung had an average population of heterotrophic bacteria of 2.1x107 cfu/g and hydrocarbon degrading bacteria of 4.0x106 cfu/g. The percentage of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria to the total heterotrophic bacteria of the oil contaminated soil plus cow dung and poultry droppings ranged from 0.07% to 84% which showed the effectiveness of animal manure in enhancing biodegradation of crude oil. The percentage crude oil degraded in the oil-contaminated soil plus droppings and the oil-contaminated soil with cow dung were 89.7% and 88 % for 28 days respectively. The highest amounts of CO2 evolved from the contaminated soil with poultry droppings and contaminated soil with cow dung were recorded on 14th and 17th day of incubation as 0.16dm3 and 0.15dm3 repectively. Alcaligenes, Actinomyces, Bacillus, Norcadia and Pseudomonas were the most common bacterial species isolated from the contaminated soils, implying that they were capable of utilizing the crude oil. Salmonella, Escherichia, Shigella, Vibrio, Kurthia and Corynebacterium were the bacteria species isolated from uncontaminated soil plus animal manure. Some physico-chemical parameters of the soil such as the pH and percentage carbon increased from 7.1 to 7.5 and from 0.97% to 2.66% in oil-contaminated soil plus cow dung respectively. The Carbon:Nitrogen ratio of all the soil set-ups increased after addition of animal manure.The study concluded that crude oil-contaminated soil could be remeditaed by treating with cow dung or poultry droppings resulting in an increase in the number of both heterotrophic and hydrocarbon degrading bacteria and fungi as well as an increase in some nutrients of the soil.|Thesis collection|poultry droppings/heterotrophic/cow dung/Actinomyces/oil-contaminated soil/animal manure.*||||||Fadipe, Olusola Olayemi|F|Engineering Assessment Of Medical Waste Management In Selected Hospitals In Osun State.|||||| M.

A combination of purposive and random sampling techniques was used to select respondents that were administered questionnaires. A field survey was conducted for ground-truthing of collected data on the facilities, personnel, equipment, location, etc. for medical waste management. The data was analysed and quantities of wastes generated per day, per patient per day, types of storing, collection, transportation and disposal systems were evaluated. The outcome of the analyses was then used in proposing and designing a sustainable, environment friendly method for engineering management of medical waste.The result showed that storage facilities in common use included plastic basket, covered bins, metal bins and silos. The average volume of wastes generated increased with the level of services; 0.35kg/day in primary health centres, 0.39kg in specialised institutions, 4.1kg/day in private hospitals, 33.3kg/day in secondary health institutions and 116kg/day in tertiary health institutions. The waste generation in State Hospitals ranged from 0.16 - 0.37kg/patient/day with an average of 0.27kg/patient/day. based on number of beds and outpatient department daily cases. Over 83.9% of collection and transportation were done manually while the others employed the use of carts and wheelbarrows. The method of waste disposal was indiscriminate open dumping and uncontrolled burning within and outside the facilities. There was no sanitary landfill in the study area. The specifications for the design of the Mark 9-type of incinerator suitable for the total volume of waste generated were estimated to be 1.38m x 1.38m x 1.6m for primary and secondary chambers. 1.38m x 1.38m x 0.6m for ash chamber and 12hrs per day for burn time. Similarly, design parameters for landfill and aerobic lagoons management techniques were established.It was concluded that sanitary disposal of medical waste was not practiced and hence the urgent need to adopt an environment-friendly and sustainable method of medical waste management analysed in this study|Thesis collection|medical waste/wheelbarrows/sanitary landfill/Mark 9-type/silos/covered bins*||||||Afolabi, John Adebayo |M|A Poetics Of Historical Drama In Africa||||||Ph.D. Literature In English|Ibitokun, B.

This was with a view to establishing critical criteria for qualifying works as historical drama in African literature.Twelve plays, covering both the popular theatre and literary traditions from different parts of Africa which were considered to be re-enactments of historical events, were selected for analysis. Using the theoretical framework of phenomenology, the plays were critically analysed in terms of their commitment to historical representation, thematic preoccupation and dramaturgical devices used. From thematic and stylistic features that identified their rootedness in history and cultural practices, a poetics of historical drama in Africa was constructed.The findings revealed that all the plays were based on events that actually took place in the past, which were verifiable from either written records, oral accounts, or both. The historical incidents were not merely narrated or cursorily referred to in the plays but were performed. The study identified common reasons for writing historical plays, namely the need to correct wrong official records of history, educate people about important historical facts, and propagate historical conventions and existent cultural norms and values. Common features and dramaturgical techniques identified in the plays included the portrayal of African experience, the depiction of African ethic, culture and worldview, supralogocentric use of language, employment of all communication codes to portray the immanence of African innate expressiveness, the use of myths and legends as historical underlay and the creative manipulation and outright distortion of historical facts for dramaturgical and ideological purposes.The study concluded that it would not be enough to treat a historical subject for an African play to qualify as a historical drama; a robust re-enactment of the particular historical event concerned, coupled with a re-creation of an African atmosphere would be a sine qua non.|Thesis collection.|dramaturgical/historical drama/phenomenology/cultural practices/supralogocentric*||||||Akinrinade, Rita Nkechiyem|F|Religious Commitment And Sexual Behaviour Among Students Of The Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife.||||||M.A. Religious Studies.|Ojo, M.

It investigated the students' perception of, and adherence to, the beliefs and practices of their religious groups, and the extent of their influence on the students' attitudes towards reproductive health issues such as pre-marital sex, sexual orientation, abortion, sexually transmitted diseases, and HIV/AIDS within specific Christian and Muslim groups. The study further assessed the adequacy of the facilities and programmes on sexual enlightenment in selected Christian and Muslim groups. This was with a view to understanding the role religious commitment played in helping young people cope with reproductive health issues and their sexuality in the face of contemporary liberal norms about sexuality.Multi-disciplinary approaches involving phenomenological and sociological approaches were used. Firstly, confessional literature written by preachers and religious leaders, which dealt with sexuality, chastity and holiness, and was circulating among young people, was examined to obtain a composite picture of contemporary religious teachings on sexuality. Additional data were collected from purposively selected students of different Christian and Muslim groups through questionnaire and interview. A questionnaire was administered on two hundred and fifty selected undergraduate and postgraduate students. Twenty percent each of the questionnaire were administered on first year, second year, third year, final year, and postgraduate students of the Obafemi Awolowo University. Of these, 40% were administered on Muslim students while 60% were administered on Christian students because there were more Christian groups than Muslim ones on the Obafemi Awolowo University campus. Moreover, the study relied on eight sessions of Focus Group Discussions in order to obtain qualitative and quantitative data on the sexual behaviour and religious commitment of the students. Furthermore, interviews were conducted with three Christian and three Muslim student leaders purposively selected on the campus.The study showed that virtually all Christian and Muslims interviewed (92%) had a strong concern about piety and healthy sexuality in the society. Hence, the large volume of literature on sexuality written by Christian and Muslim preachers for young people emphasised conservative and restrictive perspectives on sexuality. Interviews and Focus Group Discussions indicated that religious commitment affected adolescent sexual attitudes in a positive way. Such religious commitment created boundaries of acceptable and non-acceptable moral behaviour within which young people exercised their choices. In addition, religious teachings through literature and multimedia channels were the main resources that informed decisions of young Christians and Muslims on sexuality. The Study further revealed that 50.5% of the respondents believed that membership of their religious group, and Christian and Islamic doctrines on sexuality had to a large extent positively influenced their sexual behaviour. Other significant factors recognised by the respondents included peer pressure (35%), parental influence (19%), and the fear of contracting the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (4%).The study concluded that despite the promotion of liberal values on sexuality by the print and electronic media, religious beliefs and practices would remain important factors influencing sexual behaviour among students of Obafemi Awolowo University. In a most significant way therefore, the strong religious commitment of the students played considerable role in helping them cope with the    reproductive health issues and sexual challenges.|Thesis collection|sexual behaviour/muslim groups/preachers/chastity/multimedia/peer pressure*||||||Ayinde, Julius Olatunde|M|Evaluation Of Role Performance Of Osun State Farmers' Congress (OSFC) In Agricultural Production In Osun State, Nigeria.||||||M.

It also identified the expected and the actual roles of Osun State Farmers' Congress (OSFC) as agent, target and medium of change. This was with a view to providing useful information in extension programme planning directed towards improved agricultural development programmes.Four administrative zones namely: Iwo, Osogbo, Ede and Ife Local Government Areas (LGAs) as well as sixteen villages were randomly selected for this study. One hundred and twenty-six were randomly selected from the list of registered members. Validated and pre-tested structured interview schedule was used to collect data from selected participants, which represent 20% of registered members. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and correlation analysis.The results showed that 93% of the respondents were married and 80% were male with average age of 55 years. Sixty percent had minimum of primary education while the average household size was 8 and 45% of the respondents were farmers with average of 29 years farming experience and 48 years of residence in the farming communities. About 75% cultivated less than 5 hectares of land, whilst 68% belonged to more than three social organizations with an average household income of N76,000.00k per annum. The OSFC played the roles of agent, target and medium of change for its members as the results indicated that 80% of the respondents enjoyed input supply services, 83% enjoyed linkage with relevant institutions and 85% enjoyed exposure to improved farming systems.

It also examined the problems associated with verbal communication in the teaching of the subject with a view to promoting the use of appropriate communication activities in English thereby improving students' use of English within and outside the classroom.The survey design was used. The population consisted of Junior Secondary School (JSS III) students and English Language teachers in Ile-Ife. The sample size was 403 students comprising 23 English Language teachers and 380 class three students from four purposively selected private and four purposively selected public secondary schools. Four instruments were used, namely: teachers' questionnaire titled "Teachers' Questionnaire on Classroom Communication Activities" (TQCCA), divided into two sections which elicited response in areas of experience, teaching methods and problems usually encountered in the classroom; students' questionnaire titled "Students' Questionnaire on English Language Classroom Activities" (SQELCA), divided into two sections which sought personal information about the students and the kind of activities their teachers used in the class, a written task on picture stories, where students chose and wrote on one of the two picture stories provided. In addition, observation of actual classroom interaction was undertaken to find out teachers' effective use of verbal communication activities. Data collected were analysed using frequency counts, percentages, Eta correlation co-efficient and analysis of variance (ANOVA).From the results, 28% of the students claimed that their teachers used discussion and questioning method mostly in the classroom; followed by 19% who stated their teachers used discussion alone; 10% chose questioning and group work, 9% each went for questioning; class work as group work; discussion, questioning and group work; 6% selected discussion and group work while 5% each chose discussion and life situation; and role play, questioning and discussion. A coefficient of 0.31 was obtained as the level of correlation between the communication activities teachers used in the classroom and the result of the written test given to the students which shows that there is a significant difference in the performance scores of students exposed to various communication activities and students who were not. The problems usually encountered in the language classroom were seen to range from lack of teaching aids to problems of socio-economic background of the students. However, 30% from the total number of respondents reported that lack of teaching aids constitutes a major obstacle to effective communication activities.This study concluded that the use of a variety of activities, which will aid performance, is not being exploited by English language teachers due to a number of problems highlighted by them.|Thesis collection|communication/classroom/group work/teaching aids/Eta correlation/language teachers*||||||Ibitoye, Matthew Olomolatan|M|An Assessment Of Accelerated Soil Erosion In Irele Local Government Area, Ondo State||||||M.Sc.

This was with the view to ascertaining the roles of the specific factors in effecting erosion in the study area.The study was carried out in four settlements located in various parts of Irele Local Government namely; Ode-Irele, Akotogbo, Ajagba and Lipanu. Ode-Irele was purposefully selected due to its status as the Local Government Headquarter while the other three (3) settlements were selected from the list of towns in Irele Local Government using a table of random numbers. Six gullies were identified in the settlements: Two channels each at Ode-Irele and Akotogbo, and one each at Ajagba and Lipanu. The areas as well as the spot heights of all the gully catchments were determined with the aid of Global Positioning System. The spot heights were later analysed using specialised programme, Suffer 3.2 for Window to produce contour maps and the digital elevation models (DEM) of the catchment areas. The dimensions of all the gullies (length, width and depth) were also determined in the field with measuring tape and leveling staff at intervals of 10 m. The measured values of widths and depths of all the channels were plotted to produce the gully profiles. Soil samples at a depth of 0-15 cm were collected and analysed for bulk density, soil texture, moisture content and permeability.The soil bulk density averaged 1.70 g/m3 while moisture content averaged 11.04 %. The textural analysis showed mean values of 59.0 %. 7.0 % and 34.0 % of sand, silt and clay respectively. The mean depths of the gullies ranged from 1.0 to 5.85 m, while mean width ranged from 2.31 to 5.75 m. The mean gully lengths ranged between 6 to 750m. The mean cross-sectional area of the gully ranged between 2.27 and 37.89 m2 and the volumes of soil excavated from all the erosion channels were estimated at 47,522.12 m3 while sediment loss was estimated at 84,788.51 tons. The rate of sediment loss per catchment was 26.2 m3/ha for Lipanu, 185.8 m3/ha, 651.3 m3/ha, 98.2 m3/ha and 995.8 m3/ha for LA Primary School area, Ajagba and Akotogbo respectively.It was concluded that soil erosion was caused by large volume of runoff generated by the typical high intensity tropical storms flow mainly on steep earth roads and unpaved drains.|Thesis collection|soil erosion/gully profiles/erosion channels/digital elevation models/permeability/storms flow*||||||Abogan, Philips Opeyemi|M|External Debt Burden And Economic Growth In Nigeria, 1970-2004||||||M.

This was with a view to investigating whether or not the external debt burden was a major determinant of real economic growth fluctuation in Nigeria.The study used annual time series data from 1970 to 2004. Data were obtained from Statistical Bulletin published by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and International Financial Statistics published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Error Correction Model (ECM) was specified to analyze the main determinants of external debt burden and economic growth as well as the relative contribution of external debt burden to economic growth fluctuations in Nigeria. The stationary and cointegration properties of the variables were also examined.The results showed that the main determinants of external debt burden in Nigeria were exchange rate (t= -2.8 p<0.05), export (t= -2.6 p<0.05), fiscal deficit (t= 4.44, p<0.05) and inflation rate (t= 3.6 p<0.05). While increase in export and real exchange rates caused reduction in debt burden, similar increase in fiscal deficit and inflation rate resulted in increase in external debt burden. Domestic Investment (t=4.16, p<0.05) and Foreign Direct Investment (t=-4.73, p<0.05) had significant effects on economic growth. More importantly, both external debt stock (t=-4.19, p<0.05) and external debt servicing (t= 2.01, p< 0.05) also had significant effects on economic growth. The result showed further that the error correction term was also negative and significant (t=-2.71, p<0.05); implying a significant long run feed back effect on the short run economic growth fluctuations in Nigeria.The study concluded that external debt burden among other variables was a major determinant of real economic growth fluctuation in Nigeria, Hence, external debt burden reduction, fiscal deficit and exchange rate fluctuations along with export and investment promotion had potentials for stimulating sustainable economic growth in Nigeria|Thesis collection| debt burden/International Monetary Fund/Error Correction Model/fiscal deficit/growth fluctuations/external debt*||||||Aremu, Funmilayo|F|Development Of An Estimation Model For HIV/AIDS Transmission In Nigeria ||||||M.

Cumulative probability equation and truncated geometric distributions concepts were used to reduce the inherent problems such as over projection of infected people and high rate of transmission associated with the AVERT model (An Estimation Model for the Reduction of HIV/AIDS Transmission). The model was implemented using Visual Basic 6.0 programming language. The model was tested using sample data collected from Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals (OAUTHC). Ile-Ife, Osun State; University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, Oyo State; and General Hospital, Akure, Ondo State. Two scenarios rate of transmission of HIV/AIDS from male to female and from female to male were considered in the implementation.The result showed a gradual decrease in the rate of transmission of HIV/AIDS when effective preventive measures were introduced and therefore resulted in lower projection rate as compared with the AVERT model. In addition, the developed estimation model showed a reduction in the rate of transmission from 93% in AVERT model to 82% for scenario I (rate of transmission of HIV/AIDS from male to female) and from 65% in AVERT model to 60% for scenario II (rate of transmission of HIV/AIDS from female to male).It was concluded that the model proposed in this research resulted in a more robust estimation of the transmission rate of HIV/AIDS than the existing model.|Thesis collection |HIV prevalence/condoms/sexual partners/transmission rate/AVERT model/scenarios rate*||||||Babalola, Sunday Oludele.|M|The Forms And Relevance Of Ajogbo Music In Awori Community Of Oto, Lagos State||||||M.

Five Awori traditional chiefs and twelve Ajogbo musicians in Oto -Awori were interviewed to collect information on Ajogbo music. The performances of the music were observed, recorded on tape, and transcribed. The collected data were analyzed using ethnomusicological theories. Library search was conducted to source information on the historical background of Lagos State.The results showed that Ajogbo music originated with the Egun of Badagry who brought the music to Oto-Awori and that the music symbolized authority, fortune, power and victory. It was further revealed that, in spite of the encroachment of Western values on Yoruba culture and traditions, the music was able to maintain its continuous stability and originality as part of the musical heritage in the palace of the Oloto of Oto-Awori. The forms employed in Ajogbo Music were vocal and instrumental. The vocal forms included short lyrics, simple and complex rhythm, slow and fast tempo, antiphonal singing, indefinite pitches and light texture. The instrumental forms, in terms of the components of its musical instruments were four drums, namely Iya Ilu, Atele Iyalu, Omele and Kenkekenke, which were regarded as standard in the worship of Yoruba deities. Iya ilu led all the other drums. There was a concept of family in the organization of the drums. There was gradation of tone colour in choosing the drums, and the number four was significant in the worship of ancestral gods who were all conceptualized as males. The stylistic devices employed in the performance of Ajogbo music included improvisation, repetition, call and response, and heightened speech. Ajogbo music served as a medium of communication and as a form of entertainment. It was also used to narrate historical events, evoke and invoke spirits and ancestors during ritual worship, sing praises of people, and satirize foibles and ills of society.The study concluded that Ajogbo music was a vital part of the royal insignia of the Oloto. The musicians functioned as a living archive and as oral historians of the palace and people of Oto-Awori community in Lagos State.|Thesis collection|Ajogbo musisc/Oto-Awori/Kenkekenke/deities/ritual worship/historians/Atele Iyalu*||||||Aweda, Iyiola Oyebimpe|F|Composting Of Food Waste Using Cow Dung And Poultry Droppings As Boosters||||||M.

This was with a view of producing a safe compost with good quality fertilizer and to evaluate the level of pathogenicity and toxicity of the compost and its fertilizer quality.Food wastes (2.5 kg) containing different proportions (0.5 kg, 1.0 kg and 2.0 kg) of either cowdung or poultry droppings were composted in different baskets. The quantities of cowdung and poultry droppings used to treat the food waste were varied in order to determine the best proportion of food wastes to animal manure that gives the best compost. The total bacterial, total coliforms and total fungal counts of each treatment were determined using standard pour plate technique. The moisture contents, changes in temperature, weight and pH of each treatment were also monitored using established procedures. Concentration of Escherichia coli as a probable evidence of pathogenicity of the end-product was determined and the bacteria and fungi implicated in the process were identified. The level of some organic nutrients (C, N, K, P, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe) and concentration of heavy metals such as Pb, Zn were determined in order to verify their fertilizer value and probable toxicity respectively.The bacterial population of the matured composts ranged from 1.0x106 to 2.9x 107 cfu/g while the fungal count averaged 1.1 x 105 to 3.0x 105 cfu/g. Escherichia coli, an indicator of pathogenicity died out in all the composts. Similar genera of bacteria and fungi were recovered from the food waste treated with either cow dung or poultry droppings irrespective of the proportions; only the population's distribution pattern differs. Some of the bacteria recovered were of the genera Klebsiella, Bacillus, Proteus, Enterobacter, Shigella, Corynebacterium and Pseudomonas while the fungi include Mucor, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus glaucus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Geotrichum and yeast. The moisture content ranged between 50 % and 60 %. The composting process occurred within the temperature range 24 °C to 44 °C and a pH range of 5.7 to 8.8 in all the treatments. The reduction in weight of all the treatments ranged from 55 % to 84 %. The results of elemental analysis showed that the end-products contained the essential inorganic nutrients required by plants. The heavy metal level of the matured compost was below or with tolerable limits of the FAO recommended standard for organic fertilizer.In conclusion, the end-products of the process of composting food wastes using cow dung and poultry droppings as boosters are non-pathogenic, non-toxic and were suitable as organic fertilizers.|Thesis collection|food waste/Aspergillus glaucus/cow dung/composting/organic fertilizer/Geotrichum/boosters*||||||Aboderin, Oluwakemi Adebisi| F                                            |Iyisodi Ati Atupale Ihun Re Ninu Eka-Ede Awori||||||Ph.D. Yoruba Language And Literature|Adewole, L.

This was with a view to determining the deep structure of the negative markers in Standard Yoruba and Awori dialects.The methodology involved the collection of data from ten native speakers from each of the following Awori towns in Lagos State - Akesan, Ojo, Igando Ikotun, Oto, Iba, Okokomaiko. The people interviewed were fairly old people who were deemed competent in the use of the dialect for communication. The collection of data was complemented by library and archival researches. The analysis of the data was carried out within the framework of the Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG).It was found that the number of negators and their variants were more in Àwóri dialect than in Standard Yoruba. The research also revealed that the source of the syllabic nasal, n, was mu as used in ko mu and not i as claimed by earlier researchers. In addition, the study showed that the verbs in the serial verb construction have more than one noun phrase as their subjects as against a single noun phrase subject claimed by earlier researchers.

It also illustrated various forms of interpretations that could be adduced to tense and aspect in the context of the Mofoli linguistic communication milieu and contrasted them with what obtained in the Standard Yoruba. This contrastive effort was with a view to examining the question of the sensitivity or otherwise of Mofoli verbs to specific aspectual and tense notions, an issue that had been a subject of contention among the Yoruba scholars.The research methodology involved collection of data through oral interviews with about forty native speakers of the Mofoli dialect whose age bracket ranged between twenty-five and eighty-four. This is with a view to sampling people of varying age-grades, and randomly select within the dialectal area of Mofoli. This was supported by Ibadan 400-wordlist and a set of relevant self-generated questions. Library and archival researches which provided the requisite review of literature on the grammatical formatives in Yoruba were also used. The analysis of data was carried out within the theoretical framework of Government and Binding (GB).The finding showed that the interpretation of tense and aspect of some forms of the Mofoli verbs could reflect the notion of events, points of reference and moments of speech, which could ultimately instantiate the binarity of future/non-future for tense and perfect/non-perfect for aspect. The markers involved in the standard Yoruba were a/yoo/oo/o/maa (neutra), a maa (imperfective progressive aspect), a maa/ma máa (imperfective habitual aspect), a ti máa/ti ma máa (perfective aspect continuous), á ti/ó) ti/ti máa (perfective aspect past), n (progressive aspect); while those of the Mofoli were á / mee (neutra), i mee (imperfective progressive aspect), ee mee (imperfective habitual aspect), i ti mée/éé ti mée (perfective aspect beginning), a ti/ti mée (perfective aspect ending) and in/n (progressive aspect). The study also found that temporal order was a fundamental tool for the notion and identification of tense and aspect. Thus, the study was able to demystify a number of key syntactic misconceptions hitherto associated with Yoruba tense and aspect. For instance, it was discovered that the controversies on the sources and status of the syllabic nasal n, which also marks the progressive aspect, were unnecessary because the inherent forms of n in Mofoli pointed to their proto status. In addition, the study showed that tense- in standard Yoruba and Mofoli is not synonymous with a morphological representation of the opposition present-past; and that an across-the-board morphological application of the implications of the analysis of tense and aspect to Mofoli (as in English) will invariably lead to syntactic inaccuracy.The study concluded that although tense was not overtly marked in Mofoli, time reference was sometimes lexicalized by the use of deictic adverbials.|Thesis collection|Plateaeu State/Mofoli verbs/progressive aspect/syllabic nasal/deictic adverbials*||||||Fatula, Olugbemi|M|Feminist Jurisprudence Perspective On Some Aspects Of Nigerian Law.||||||M.Phil.

It also analysed some fundamental and crucial areas of the Nigerian law with a view to determining the extent to which Nigerian women have been marginalized or discriminated against.The study relied on primary and secondary sources of information. The primary sources included the Nigerian Constitution and other legislation, local customs, judicial decisions and international conventions. The secondary sources of information included journal articles, books and technical reports. The data so obtained were subjected to critical analysis.The study revealed that having been conceptualised and written by men from their point of view, conventional jurisprudence, starting from natural law school through analytical positivism, historical school, sociological jurisprudence, marxist jurisprudence, the realists movement and even the critical legal studies movement have all ignored the existence and role of women in their analysis of law and legal institutions. The study also revealed that the logic and the language of conventional jurisprudence reflect male's point of view and that some crucial aspects of the Nigerian law discriminate against Nigerian women though there had been constitutional, legislative and judicial interventions in some of these areas with a view to creating a gender neutral society. Such discriminatory areas of the Nigerian law included the Nigerian 1999 Constitutional provisions on citizenship by registration, provisions of taxation law relating to tax relief, Nigerian labour law, law of  evidence relating to competence and compellability of wives in a polygamous marriage, law relating to marital and non marital rape, law of bail, law of domestic and non-domestic violence, law relating to women's and daughters' succession and inheritance rights under statutory, custom and Islamic laws, law of domicile of women as well as laws and practices relating to marriage. The study concluded that in spite of some shortcomings of feminism, some practical contributions of the feminist's movement have had lasting effect as it provided great stimulus to the feministic study of law and institutions.|Thesis collection|journal articles/marxist jurisprudence/tax relief/inheritance rights/feminist's movement/Nigerian law*||||||Inyang, Ephraim Peter|M|A Determination Of The Thermoluminescence (Tl) Characteristics Of Some Silica Based Glass.||||||M.

The fused quartz was from SPI laboratory, West Chester, USA. The soda-lime glass materials were either cut into specific dimensions or pulverized into powder before annealing. The samples were exposed to ionizing radiation using Gamma cell 200 irradiator for various time intervals followed by readout using a Victoreen TL reader (2800 M) The glow curves obtained were analyzed using the Microcal Origin graphical software. The result showed that the soda-lime type glass material displayed a single peak glow curve with the maximum (Tmax) at 548 K while the fused quartz glow curves had two peaks at 443 K and around 673 K. It was noted that the soda-lime type 1 glass demonstrated the least sensitivity to gamma irradiation, followed by soda-lime type 3. The soda-lime type 2 showed more than 100% increase in TL response over the glasses studied. Powdered soda-lime glass showed significant increase in dose-response sensitivity than the whole glass, showing shift in Tmax towards a higher temperature.All glasses studied showed considerable fading over the first few hours post-irradiation and stabilized within 8 days of storage in the case of the soda-lime glasses. The glow peak maximum temperature (Tmax) was shifted from 523 K at about five minutes after irradiation to 593 K after 8 eight days of storage.The glow curve characteristics, studied with change in dose demonstrated that for the soda-lime glasses, the Tmax was invariant under change in occupancy. The fused quartz presented anomalous fading in peak II (Tmax = 673 K) after an initial enhancement. The fading in peak I followed by enhancement of Peak II indicates some kind of interaction between the two traps involved.The study concluded that the glass materials could be used in Thermoluminescence Dosimetry (TLD) especially in high dose dosimetry and retrospective / accident dosimetry.|Thesis collection|Powdered soda- lime/silica-based glass/fused quartz/Thremoluminescence dosimetry/Gamma cell*||||||Ijadunola, Macellina Yinyinade|F|Male Involvement in Family Planning Decision Making in Ile-Ife, Osun State||||||M.P.H.

The aim was to determine the extent of male involvement in family planning and reproductive goal decision making among couples in Ile-lfe, Nigeria.Both quantitative and qualitative methodologies were used. The quantitative survey employed a cross-sectional descriptive design using a structured household questionnaire to collect information from 402 male study participants and 50% of their spouses. A multistage sampling procedure was employed, where 10% of the 400 enumeration areas (EM) were selected by simple random sampling. For the selected EM, all the constituent households (second stage sampling unit) were listed and one eligible respondent (third stage sampling unit) was interviewed from every Kth household. The qualitative design consisted of twelve focus group discussions and four in-depth interviews with identified groups and individuals. Data were analysed using appropriate descriptive and inferential statistical techniques.A majority (72%) of the male respondents were aged between 30 and 49 years, while half of the female respondents were between 30 and 39 years old. Virtually all (99.8%) male respondents were aware of the existence of at least one modem family planning method. Eighty nine percent of men approved of the use of family planning while only about 11% disapproved of it. The most common reason given for family planning approval was birth spacing, while that for disapproval was religious dictates (44% and 38% respectively). Eighty percent of men had ever used contraception while 56% of them were current users. Spousal communication about family planning and other family reproductive goals was quite poor, as consistently less than a quarter of either male respondents or their spouses individually initiated discussions on common reproductive health issues such as when to achieve a pregnancy, when to avoid a pregnancy and use of contraceptives. Furthermore, about a third of couples never discussed family planning in the year preceding the survey, while just about half of men and two-fifths of their spouses discussed family planning only one or two times during the same time period. While most of the female focus group discussion participants had attended family planning clinics, most male participants had not. All family planning providers interviewed corroborated men's low patronage of family planning services, but were favorably disposed to men attending their services. The providers were of the opinion that cultural beliefs, societal perception that family planning was a women's affair and religious misconceptions were the main reasons for men's poor patronage.The study concluded that male involvement in family planning decision making in Ile-Ife is poor and their patronage of family planning services is low.|Thesis collection                                              |family planning services/poor patronage/Spousal communication/religious misconceptions/birth spacing/contraceptives*||||||Fagbohun, Francis Oluyemi |M|An Appraissal Of Revenue Generation Strategies In Selected Local Governments In Osun State||||||M.

Primary data were collected through questionnaire administered on two hundred and forty employees of the local government from twelve local governments out of the thirty in Osun State. The choice of the twelve was done on basis of two local governments from each of the six geo-political zones that make up Osun State. The respondents in each of the sampled local governments are key officials and head of various departments in the local government. This was complemented with data collected through an in-depth interview of six seasoned principal officers from each of the six geo-political zones that recently retired from the local government service in the state. Secondary data were obtained from official records and documents of the local governments especially the annual estimates of the sampled local governments and other published work of scholars on related subjects. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.The study revealed that all local governments were not generating enough revenue locally as evidenced by their relying almost exclusively on the monthly statutory allocation from the central government, which in all cases represent more than 80% of the revenue of the local government in the study area. Internally generated revenue as percentage of total revenue stood at between 0.05% and to 8.4% in the sampled local governments. The study also revealed that most of the strategies usually adopted are no longer efficient (x2 = 11.4); Such strategies like blockade of roads, licensing and serving of assessment notices on properties and the usage of tax force have become weak, inefficient and corrupted. The study equally revealed that most local governments lack facilities and taxable services on which they could place user charges to generate revenue.The study concluded that the existing strategies of generating revenue internally for local governments are not adequate to bring in substantial revenue to the coffers of the local governments enough to perform their statutory functions|Thesis collection|local governments/pirncipal officers/revenue generation/statutory allocation/licensing/geo-political zones*||||||Akindipe James Olufemi|M|Gender issues in the appointment and Promotion of staff in osun state Civil service||||||M.Sc.

It also studied the relationship between male and female workers as well as the nature of problems arising from appointment and promotion of workers in the service.Primary and secondary data were employed for the study. The study was conducted in three ministries namely, Information, Health and Education. The total number of workers in the ministries during the time of study was four hundred and fifty (450) out of which 53.3 percent (240 workers) was male and 46.7 percent (210 workers) was female. The ministries were selected because they possessed the higher number of workers in the state. Three hundred (300) questionnaires were distributed and stratified sampling technique was used to distribute the questionnaires. To reflect the size of the male and female workers, 60 percent of the questionnaires were distributed to male and 40 percent to female. Out of the three hundred (300) questionnaires distributed two hundred and seventy six (276) representing 92% were retrieved. Secondary data were collected from academic journals, government and official publications. Simple descriptive statistics was used for data analysis.The study revealed that appointment and recruitment exercises in the service reflected gender traces. Men were considered to perform most jobs better than women and more men were appointed into them. That was why 70.6 percent of the respondents said the mode of appointing and recruiting workers was not fair because men were much favoured by the mode of appointment and recruitments. As a result of this, 69.8 percent of the respondents wanted the mode reviewed so that more women could be injected into the composition of the state civil service. Also, the study showed that the promotion exercise was not gendered. Out of the 52 percent of the respondents that claimed to have been cheated in promotion exercise, 28 percent was male while 24 percent was female. This showed that cheating was not based on sex but on other factors. In addition, 91.3 percent said nobody had ever been promoted above them because of gender. The reason for this was that there was a laid-down procedure for promotion in the service. It, therefore, followed that the procedure was being followed in promotion exercise. Moreover, the working relationship between male and female workers in the service was cordial. The study revealed that 47.1 percent preferred to work with men while 48.6 percent preferred to work with women. Since there were more male workers in the service, it means many male workers would work closely with female workers. Furthermore, 55.8 percent of the workers said they related fairly well with the senior opposite sex while 38 percent related with them intimately. Only 6.2 percent related fairly. This showed cordial relationship between the bosses and the subordinates irrespective of gender in the service.The study concluded that there were traces of gender in the appointment and recruitment exercises in Osun State Civil Service. However, the promotion exercise was gender-free and the relationship among the workers was cordial.|Thesis Collection|Gender issues/civil service/appointment and promotion/recruitment exercises/ministries*||||||Olapade, Rufus Ilesanmi|M|Neuropharmacological Studies of Persea Americana Miller (LAURACEAE) leaf extract||||||Ph.D Pharmacology|Ukponmwan, O.

The extract, fractions, antagonists (flumazenil, atropine, yohimbine and naloxone) and reference drugbenzodiazepine) were administered to mice and observed for novelty-induced behaviours (NIBs), open-field locomotion activity (OFL), head dips, pentobarbitonec-induced sleeping time (PIST), anxiety, convulsions, psychosis (amphetamine, morphine-induced stereotypy), pain (hot-plate and tail flick tests), muscle coordination and learning.Acute toxicity studies revealed that the intraperitoneal LD50 values for PAL, AF
EAF were 720, 650 and 875 mg/kg respectively. Phytochemical screening of the leaf
t and its fractions revealed differences in their contents of cardiac glycosides,phenolic compounds, compounds with steroidal nucleus, flavonoids, alkaloids,
anthraquinones derivatives, flavonols, saponins and tannins. The leaf extract and its
fractions decreased NIBs, OFL and head dips in mice with the aqueous fraction
demonstrating, more pronounced effects than the ethyl acetate fraction. Flumazenil, aspecific GABAA receptor antagonist, decreased the action of the aqueous fraction on
NIBs, OFL and head dips, but it had no effect on the inhibitory actions produced by ethylacetate fraction. Naloxone, atropine and yohimbine had no effect on the inhibitory action of the aqueous and ethyl acetate fractions on NIBs and OFL, while, atropine alone reduced the inhibitory action of both fractions on head dips. The leaf extract and itsfractions also prolonged P1ST, which was reduced by fluma7enil. However, naloxone, atropine and yohimbine did not affect the sedative property of the aqueous fraction. In the e vein, the extract and fractions did not protect mice against leptazol, strychnine and 'crotoxin-induced convulsions. The fractions decreased open arm avoidance index, h was antagonized by flumazenil and atropine. The leaf extracts reduced amphetamine and apomorphine-induced stereotypy, which was not demonstrated by the fractions. The results obtained showed that the plant extract and fractions' inhibitory ects, sedative and anxiolytic actions are mediated through GABAergic receptors. The 'bitory effect did not involve opioids, cholinergic and adrenergic receptors. The plant ssesses no anticonvulsant, analgesic properties and no influence on learning and ory.The study concluded that the leaf extract and its fractions were relatively safe and poseised sedative, anxiolytic and anti-psychotic properties that were mediated via GABAergic and cholinergic mechanisms, thus, supporting the use of the leaf as a sedative in folkloric medicine.xxtsuggesting that opioid, cholinergic and adrenergic mechanisms were not involved in these actions. Atropine reduced the effects of both fractions on head dips, indicating mediation via cholinergic mechanism.The leaf extract and its fractions prolonged PIST, which was reduced by flumazenil, a specific GABA-A receptor antagonist, showing the involvement of GABAergic mechanism. Naloxone, atropine and yohimbine did not influence the sedative actions of the aqueous fraction, indicating that these actions did not involve opioid, cholinergic and adrenergic receptors. The leaf extract and its fractions did not protect against leptazol, strychnine and picrotoxin-induced convulsions. The aqueous and ethyl acetate fractions at low doses decreased open arm avoidance index, showing their anxiolytic properties. Flumazenil and atropine antagonized these anxiolytic actions, indicating mediation via GABAergic and cholinergic mechanisms. The leaf extract reduced amphetamine/apomorphine-induced stereotypy; indicating its anti-psychotic property, but this was not demonstrated in the fractions. The leaf extract and its fractions showed no pronounced analgesic activities and no effect on learning at low doses. Toxicological studies revealed that the LD50 values for the leaf extract and its fractions were higher than the standard minimum value for intraperitoneal route in mice, indicating that the extract/fractions were not toxic in mice.The study concluded that the leaf extract and its fractions were relatively non-toxic and possessed sedative and anxiolytic properties mediated via GABAergic and cholinergic mechanisms. Sedation manifested by decrease in head dips was mediated via cholinergic receptors. The leaf extract demonstrated anti-psychotic property. These support the use of the leaf as a sedative in folkloric medicine.|Thesis collection|Neuropharmacological Studies, persea americana miller, Leaf Extract, Ethanolic Leaf Extract, novelty-induced behaviours,  open-field locomotion activity, head dips, pentobarbitonec-induced sleeping time (PIST), anxiety, convulsions, psychosis (amphetamine, morphine-induced stereotypy), pain, muscle coordination and learning, GABAergic and cholinergic mechanisms*
