It specifically investigated men's knowledge and their level of spousal communication in relation to the use of contraceptives, their involvement in the use of condoms as a means of family planning or as a prevention of STDs especially HIV/AIDS, and their attitude to safer sex. bearing in mind the risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including HIV/AIDS.The data used were collected through interview schedule in which 300 respondents 220 men aged 20 years and above, and 80 women of reproductive age (15-49) were randomly selected and interviewed. Data were analysed in three stages i.e. Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate. The logistic regression model was used to establish the relationship between response variables and explanatory variables.The study found that knowledge of contraceptive methods was relatively high while usage was relatively low. Majority used contraceptive methods for birth spacing and for the prevention of STDs. Monogamously married men were more likely to be knowledgeable about contraceptive methods and their usage than men who were in other unions. They were also more likely to have discussed desired family size and when to stop childbearing with their partners.Awareness of STDs and its mode of transmission were relatively high while the use of condom was relatively low. Unmarried men were found to be more likely to use condom for STDs than married men. Men who were not staying with their families were more likely to have used condom for the prevention of STDs than men who were staying with their families. It was also found that the number of male respondents who had ever contracted STDs was relatively low in the study area. Polygamously married men were more likely to have contracted and treated for STDs than men who were in polygynous union. However, men who had contracted and treated for STDs 12 months prior to the survey were more likely to have changed their sexual behaviour in preventing HIV/AIDS by stopping the use of unsterilized instruments/needles rather than the use of condom and/or stick to one sexual partner than men who were not.Based on the findings, it was observed that failure of respondents to use condom or stick to one sexual partner would have great implications for the spread of STDs including HIV/AIDS. This implied that the awareness of HIV/AIDS was yet to have any positive impact on male sexual behaviour in the study area.|Theses collection|Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Contraceptives, HIV/AIDS, Family planning*||||||Adebayo, Kafayat Adenrele|F|Microbial studies on sorghum fermentation during `ogi' preparation||||||M.Sc|Abiose, S.H||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,Food Science and Technology|2005|||OAU|||||xiv,100p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The pH was monitored with a pH meter, while titratable acidity was evaluated by titrating samples against NaOH solution, and was calculated as % lactic acid (w/v). Tannin content was determined by modified vanillin - hydrochloric acid method. Sample extraction was done with HCL/ Methanol solution and the filtrate was made to react with vanillin-HCL reagent. Varying catechin concentrations were prepared to obtain a standard curve. Tannin concentrations of samples were then obtained from the catechin curve. Total viable and Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) counts were carried out on Nutrient agar and Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) agar respectively. LAB were isolated and identified using cultural and colonial morphology complemented with biochemical tests. The isolates were screened for bacteriocin production by the deferred antagonism plate assay against Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. Cell-free supernatants of the isolates were tested for bacteriocin activities using spot-on-lawn and agar well diffusion assays.The results showed that the pH of fermenting sorghum grains decreased while the titratable acidity increased in both varieties. Tannin contents in raw grains were 2l mg/g catechin equivalent (C.E) and 3.5mg/g C.E for red and white sorghum, respectively. These values decreased to 4.2mg/g C.E and 0.6 mg/g C.E in R/ogi and W/ogi, respectively at the end of 96 hour fermentation. Total viable count increase from 1.8 x 104 cfu/ml in both varieties to 1.9 x 108 cfu/ml in R/ogi and 3.0 x 108 in W/ogi at the end of the 96 hour fermentation. Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) count increased from 3.1 x 10 cfu/ml to 7.9 x  107 cfu/ml in R/ogi while it increased from 3.5 x 10cfu/ml to 3.2 x 108cfu/ml in W/ogi at the end of the fermentation period. The bacteria identified were Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Pediococcus acidilactici, Lactobacillus confusus, Leuconostoc paramesenteroides and Streptococcus bovis. The final stage of fermentation was dominated by Pediococcus pentosaceus and Enterococcus faecium, accounting for 80% of total bacterial isolates. Lactobacillus confusus, Leuconostoc paramesenteoides and Streptococcus bovis were isolated only in R/ogi between 0 and 48 hours. The six LAB identified produced inhibition against Bacillus cereus NCIB 6349, Escherichia coli NCIB 86 and Staphylococcus aureus NCIB 8588. In conclusion, LAB were found to be important in sorghum fermentation and the isolates were capable of inhibiting the growth of enteropathogenic bacteria.|Thesis collection|sorghum fermentation/ogi preparation/E.coli/B.cereus/S.aureus/lactic acid bacteria/bacteriocin production/biopreservation.*||||||Adebolajo, Samuel Oluwole|M|Attitude Of Male Elite In Ile-Ife   towards Male Contraception||||||Ph.D|Odebiyi, A.

It also examined the knowledge base of the elites about male and female contraception with a view to employing the insight gained to design a proposal for an appropriate integrated family planning programme for Nigeria.Primary data were collected for this study using both structured and open-ended questionnaires. The respondents were selected using multistage cluster sampling technique from the mixed aggregates of clusters of elites and non-elites in OAU campus, Fajuyi and Ikoyi quarters, Ajanaku, Omole and Moremi estates. These clusters constituted the primary sampling units. The second stage involved the listing out of housing units in each of the clusters. The sampling frame comprised 844 housing units. One thousand and forty three households were obtained from the housing units. From these, 1000 men were selected using the lottery sampling method. The data were analyzed using the SPSS Computer Software package.The  study showed  the age of  the respondents to  range f rom  26-63  years with a mean of 46.02 years for the non-elite, a range of  15- 60 years and a mean of  44.37 years for the elite.The median age for the two groups was 45 years. The predominant occupation was public civil service with 61.27 percent elites and 51.78 percent non-elites. Businessmen constituted 14.25 percent non-elites while 8.25 percent were elites. The professionals were 7.90 percent non-elites compared with 25.40 percent elites.The study also found that the high value placed on children and the preferential gender biased sex composition of children born into the family were major determinants of the ideal family size and fertility aspirations. Other factors included parental educational level, socio-cultural background, religious affiliation and early childhood experience, personality traits, demographic characteristics, subjective perception of norms and the prevailing value consensus of the social environment. The disparity observed between elites and non elites with regards to these variables was a reflection of the differentials in the magnitude of these factors.The study further found that the belief system of the respondents, 57.5% elite and 42.5% non-elite was positively influenced by their marital status,but there was a significant inverse relationship between the belief system and the degree of religious affiliation. There was also a direct linear relationship between advancing age groups of the respondents and the  level of positive disposition towards family planning. The degree of association was also statistically significant.This study concluded by highlighting the significance of socio-demographic and socio-cultural determinants of male reproductive behaviour as a fuction of a number of variables which included personality traits ,subjective perception of societal norms,  past reinforcement including symbolic coding and cognitive organisation. these findings constituted the main ingredients in the design, development and implementation of an integrated clinic-based, male-oriented family planning programme proposed for the nation. |Thesis collection|family planning/contraception/multistage cluster sampling/lottery sampling/childhood experience/personality traits/subjective perspection.*||||||Abiona Olatunde Olusesan |M|Development of a framework for optimizing access to wide area network resources||||||Ph.D|Kehinde, L.

This was done to determine which host or application is generating the most traffic with a view to managing limited network resources efficiently.The software aspect of the network traffic monitoring system consisted of a wrapper script written in Perl language and other open source programs such as IPTraf, Multi Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG) and Webalizer. The wrapper script started the IPTraf program with suitable argument and sorted the output of IPTraf based on Internet Protocol (IP) address and protocol. The program was designed to restart every 30 minutes in order to ensure effective data gathering, maintain system stability, and minimize memory leaks. The traffic management was based on a cyclic multicast proxy server which was simulated using OPNET IT GURU Academic Edition version 9.1. During the simulation the following performance parameters: delay, response time and ethernet load were used to provide performance analysis between the proposed cyclic multicast proxy server and the caching proxy server.The results of the traffic analysis showed that over 80% of the traffic was Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP), 10% Domain Name Service (DNS), 5% Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) and about 3% File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Subsequently, MRTG produced a graphical overview of the traffic pattern while Webalizer produced a detailed analysis of the traffic pattern. The results of the simulation showed that in both single and multiple traffic types the global Ethernet delay experienced by the cyclic multicast server was about 20% lower than that of the existing caching server. Similarly, HTTP page response time was over 10% lower for cyclic multicast than for the caching server. The Ethernet load for single traffic was about 7% lower for cyclic multicast than for the caching proxy server and about 13% lower for multiple traffic. In conclusion, the cyclic multicast proxy server was found to provide a superior performance and scale better at higher traffic loads.|thesis collection|wide area network/multi router traffic grafher/webalizer/hypertext transfer  protocol/file transfer protocol/proxy server*||||||Aderibigbe, Alade Fatai|M|Development of hydrolitic procedure for cassava starch||||||M.Sc|Solomon, B.O/ Anozie, A.N||Ile-Ife,Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,Chemical Engineering|2005|||O.A.U|||||xxi,172p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University,H.O library,Ile-Ife,Osun state.Email :ul@ oauife.edu.ng|http//:www.library.oau.edu.ng||||I hereby authorize the Hezekial Oluwasanmi Library to copy my thesis,in whole or part,in responce  to request from individual researchers and organisations for the purpose of private study or reseach.|The study evaluate the hydrolic procedures for cassava starch with the aim of designing and fabricating a pilot scale hydrolizer which could be useful in small and medium scale industries. Different routes of hydrolyzing cassava flour were investigated.These included the effect of temperature on acid hydrolysis using ,0.1M-0.5 HCL; Acid /Enzyme hydrolysis using 0.1M HCL in conjuction with fungalmyl-amyloglucosidase enzyme system and also 0.1M in conjuction with Termamyl-amyloglucosidase enzyme system as well as the two enzyme system alone. Based on the Enzyme/Enzyme starch hydrolysis theory, a mathematical model was developed and solved by fourth order Runge-Kuta numerical method using Matlab programme.A hydrolyzer was subsequently designed and constructed and its performance profile was studied. The result obtained from the studies showed that increased reaction temperature and acid concentration favoured reducing sugar production during acid hydrolysis of cassava flour.With the optimum temperature of  70oC  0.1M  HCL an increase in percentage cassava flour slurry resulted in increase reducing sugar  production. Optimum reducing sugar concentration was obtained after 10 hours at 70oC  and 0.5M  acid concentration in acid hydrolysis. The maen rate of hydrolysis decreased gradually with time in Acid ,Acid / Enzyme and Enzyme/ Enzyme Hydrolysis. The reduction in the mean rate of hydrolysis could be attributed to product inhibition. The best procedure for the production of fermentable sugar from cassava starch was achived in Termamyl/Amyloglucosidase hydrolysis of 10% cassava flour slurry at 72oC /60oC after  85hour when a  71% Dextrose Equivalent (DE) was realised. This is comparable with result obtained from the solution to the developed model,which revealed that at hydrolysis time of 100hour an average of 86.4% DE was achived for Termamyl/Amyloglucosidase and 83% for Fungalmyl/amyloglucosidase at amylose and amylopectin mole fractions of  0.2 and 0.8 respectively. Kinetic study of the enzyme hydrolysis revealed a non-adherence with simple Michaelis-Menten Kinetics with or without product inhibition.This study concluded that the Enzyme/Enzyme process involving the amylase (termamy and amyloglucoisdase)was more effective than the Acid /Enzyme processes.The scale up version of the Enzyme/Enzyme process led to a satisfactory performance of the design and fabrication of protype.|thesis collection|Cassava starch/matlab programme/Enzyme hydrolysis/termamyl/Amyloglucosidase*||||||Adesanmi, Taofik Olasunkanmi|M|"Thank You" As A Discourse Marker in Service Encounters in Selected Local Government Areas of  Osun State||||||M.

It identified the different forms of thank you as a discourse marker in conversations, described the functions and frequency of thank you or its variants in conversations, and explored the factors (social and situational) affecting the different uses of thank you and its variants.Oral conversations involving the use of thank you were recorded mainly surreptitiously from eighty-eight English as Second Language discussants in four Local Government Areas: lfe Central Local Government (lfe). Boripe Local Government (Iree), Olorunda Local Government (Osogbo) and Ilesa West Local Government (Ilesa) all in Osun State, Nigeria. In each of these locations, ten conversational texts were randomly selected, transcribed and analysed using the Pragmatic Theory and Linguistic approach employed by Aijmer (1996). In all, forty texts in which there were sixty-three occurrences of thank you and its variants in use were analysed.The findings showed that thank you had more functions than the discussants attributed to it. The study discovered that thank you could he used for seven things, namely (1) to express gratitude for a major or minor favour. (2) to express phatic feeling between two speakers, (3) to depict irony, sarcasm and brusqueness in conversations, (4) to function as a discourse marker in conversations (5) to accept a service, (6) to dismiss a person' or service and (7) to express politeness in conversations. It was. also. observed that thank you as a variant of thanking strategies featured in use more than the other variants like thanes. i appieciate it. etcetera. The expression thank you had material and immaterial benefactions in view. Immaterial benefaction (which had to do with prayers, wishes greetings, etcetera) attracted the higher number of thank you (i e 33=52.38%) than the material benefaction (e.g. gifts and services), which had thirty (47.62%) This study concluded that the basis for thank  you and its variants was politeness, which should not be jettisoned because of modernization.|Thesis Collection|Discourse marker/oral conversation/ pragmatic theory*||||||Adetogun, Gbadegesi Elubode |M|Studies on the Emulsification Properties of Mentha piperita Linn.

(ocimum oil) and Mentha piperita Linn. (peppermint oil) so as to enhance their pharmaceutical value.Ocimum oil was extracted by hydrodistillation of the plant leaves while peppermint oil B.P. was purchased. Physical properties such as density, refractive index, surface tension, and viscosity of the oil samples were determined using official methods. Studies on the required Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance (HLB) of the oils were determined using blends of non-ionic emulsifying agents of known HLB values. The required HLB of liquid paraffin, whose value is documented, was also determined to validate the methods used. The effect of the emulsifier type on the stability of the essential oil emulsions was evaluated using non-ionic [sorbates (Spans®); polysorbates (Tweens®)] and ionic [anionic (sodium lauryl sulphate); cationic (cetrimide)] emulsifiers. The stability of the emulsions with respect to phase volume ratio was also studied. Droplet size analysis, creaming rate as well as turbidimetry measurements were parameters used to determine the stability of the emulsions, while centrifugation was used as an accelerated stability test.The result showed that the required HLB values of peppermint oil were 12.98 and 13.30, using  Span  85/Tween 20 and Span 80/Tween 80 blends, respectively. The required HLB value of ocimum oil was, however, not obtained in this study as only the emulsion prepared at the highest HLB value (16.70) of the emulsifier blends was temporarily stable for a day and, subsequently, cracked within a week. The HLB value of 11.80 obtained for liquid paraffin fell within the literature range of 10-12, thereby validating the methods used. The optimal phase volume concentrations for ocimum oil were 3%v/v and  20%v/v using 1%w/v Tween 20 and cetrimide, respectively. Various concentrations of the oil up to 50%v/v were stabilized with 1%w/v sodium lauryl sulphate. On the other hand, 50%v/v of peppermint oil was stabilized with 1%w/v each of Tween 20, cetrimide and sodium lauryl sulphate. The two essential oils were better emulsified with the ionic emulsifiers than the non-ionic emulsifiers. Ionic emulsifiers normally form electrically charged films around dispersed droplets making the droplets repel each other as they come closer thereby preventing coalescence. Hence, their emulsions were more stable than those prepared with non-ionics.This study concluded that ionic emulsifiers produced more stable ocimum oil emulsions than non-ionics, while peppermint oil emulsions could be stabilized with both non-ionic and ionic emulsifiers. Moreover, phase volume ratio was more critical to the stability of ocimum oil emulsions than for those of peppermint  oil.                                                                                                         |thesis collection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |mentha piperita linn/lamiaceae/ocimum gratissimum linn/lamiaceae oils/ionic emulsifiers*||||||Adesopo,  Ayo Ariyo|M|An Assessment of Inter-governmental Fiscal Relations in Selected States of Southwestern Nigeria (1996-2003)||||||M.Sc |Erero, E.

Questionnaires and interviews were the instruments used for collecting primary data. The questionnaires were administered on purposively selected political functionaries of the three selected states (Oyo, Osun and Ekiti) of  Southwestern Nigeria. The questionnaires assessed participants' opinions and perceptions of evolution and development of inter-governmental fiscal relations in Nigeria, the linkage between centralisation of power and inter-governmental fiscal relations as well as the effects of such linkage on the policy actions (formulation and implementation) of the lower levels of government in Nigeria. Of the two hundred and ninety-three questionnaires administered, one hundred and ninety-two (65.5 per cent) were retrieved. To complement the data collected from questionnaires, interviews were also conducted to seek information from the three (3) commissioners of the National Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (NRMAFC) representing the selected states. The interviews focused on the appropriateness of the revenue sharing principles; the vertical sharing of the central pool account, and the distribution of tax jurisdiction. Secondary data were obtained from relevant textbooks and official documents, especially the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) publications. Data generated from the survey were subjected to both descriptive and inferential statistical analyses using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS ) version 11.0. The hypotheses formulated for the study were tested at 0.05 level of significance. The results showed that the evolution and development of inter-governmental fiscal relations in Nigeria had been largely determined by the nature and scope of her federal structure (x2=45.95; df=3; P<0.001). It was also revealed that there existed significant relationship between centralisation of power and inter-governmental fiscal relations in Nigeria as derived from the nature of her federalism (x2 =637.69; df=4; P<0.001) (x2=421.71; df=3; P<0.001). Furthermore, the study showed that the policy actions (formulation and implementation) of the lower levels of government in Nigeria were determined by the nature of the linkage between her centralisation of power and inter-governmental fiscal relations (x2 =468.86; df 15; P<0.001). The state-by-state comparative assessment revealed no significant differences in the responses.The study concluded that the evolution and development of inter-governmental fiscal relations in Nigeria were dictated by the centralised nature of Nigeria's federal political arrangement.|thesis collection |physical policy/fiscal relations/task jurisdiction/policy action/Southwestern Nigeria*||||||Akutson, Seth Koks |M|Staffing situation in selected Nigerian Universities and its implication for human resource planning (1981- 2001)||||||Ph.D|Oladeji, S.

It also analysed the factors determining the staffing situation in selected Nigerian universities and assessed the human resource planning practices in the universities with the aim of drawing out the implications of the findings for effective human resource planning in the universities.The study used primary and secondary data. The secondary data were obtained from published documents of the National Universities Commission (NUC), the National Manpower Board (NMB) and the Abstract of Statistics of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). A survey research design was adopted for the primary data using a multi-stage sampling procedure. Eight universities were purposely selected, namely, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, University of PortHarcourt, PortHarcourt, University of Jos, Jos, Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, Enugu State University of Science and Technology, Enugu, and Federal University of Technology, Akure. The choice of universities reflected geographical spread, ownership, type and the generation to which the universities belong. A total of 495 copies of the questionnaires were administered to principal officers, deans and heads of departments in the selected eight universities.The analytical techniques were both descriptive and quantitative. Data were expressed in percentages, ratios, and tables for the descriptive analyses. The quantitative aspect of the study used multiple regression analysis of time series data on students' enrolment, funding and staffing. The study showed that about two-third of the respondents indicated that stakeholders such as the regulatory authorities, staff, students and the host communities had considerable influence in the way the universities were managed.	More than 60% of the respondents indicated that the socio-political and economic situations in the country meant that the universities had to adopt various measures to cope with these situations. These measures included increase in fees and extra charges; cutting of students' admission, embargo on employment, mounting of revenue generating programmes and suspension of capital projects.In the regression analysis, the t-value (2.0203) was found to be significant for the university staff at 5% level, while the coefficient (-0.4712) was negative, suggesting that as enrolment was increasing the staffing situation was depleting. The R-Squared (0.3978) and F-statistics (1.5413) showed the explanatory power of the model. The Granger causality test showed that the direction of causality was from enrolment to staffing;  suggesting that pressures resulting from increased students' intake determined the level of staff recruitment. The study showed that 70% of the respondents indicated that staff turnover was on the increase while recruitment lagged behind. These, coupled with inadequate funding resulted in unfilled vacant positions in the universities, especially of the teaching staff. The result from the study also showed that the nature and dimension of human resource planning problems and practices in the universities were similar. The uniform planning practices in the selected universities was attributed partly to the influence of the National Universities Commission (NUC) on the universities' management.The study concluded that the running and management of Nigerian universities was strongly influenced by their operating environment while students' enrolment was the main determinant of staffing. The implication of this was the ineffective human resource planning efforts in all the universities.|Thesis collection|human resoursce planning/multiple regression analysis/capital project/staff recruitment*||||||Alabi, Sunday Boladale |M|Rapid Determination of Controller Parameters for Uncertain Systems using the Method of Inequalities.||||||M.Sc|Taiwo, O.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,Chemical Engineeringœ|2005|||OAU|||||xxii,186p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

In the first algorithm, design weights were proposed as lead, lag and lead-lag networks and were selected by an automatic approach using the method of inequalities (MOI). In the second algorithm, the worst plant from the family of perturbed plants was identified based on Nyquist stability criterion. In algorithm 1, internal model control (IMC) configuration was used. The model uncertainty was described both in exact and norm-bounded forms. The objective functions (robust stability and performance conditions) were defined as a set of algebraic inequalities. In algorithm 2, the worst plant was identified and used for the design. Using these algorithms via IMC and classical  feedback control schemes, the objectives were defined as a set of algebraic inequalities and the controllers and/or weighting functions parameters were used in the parameter search until all the inequalities were simultaneously satisfied.From algorithm 1, the results obtained were in agreement with the results obtained from the existing H¥ approach, but simpler weights - leads and lags were obtained as opposed to higher order weights obtained from the existing trial-and-error approach. Also, both the weights and the controller were simultaneously obtained as opposed to stage-wise selection of  weights and controller design in the existing techniques. From algorithm 2, the results obtained were in agreement with those obtained by the non-conservative approach of algorithm 1. It was found that the identified worst plants before and after design were the same; with the exception of IMC in example 2, and this was probably due to dependence of IMC closed-loop stability on extreme plant dampingcoefficient. The best results obtained from the two algorithms were found to be similar to the published results by earlier workers.It was concluded that using MOI to select design weights for H¥ approach was easier and faster than using the existing H¥ approach. Also, algorithm 2 was found to be computationally economical since the effort required in the H¥ approach in selecting design weights was conserved here. Moreover, the trial-and-error difficulty involved in selecting suitable extreme model for design was overcome.|Thesis collection|controller parameter/feed control/algebraic inequalities/function parameter/internal model control*||||||Badru,  Folasade Mardiyya Idowu |F|Effect of Presentation Modes of  Computer Assisted Instuction (CAI) on Learners' Acquisation of Design Skills in Fine Arts||||||M.

It also examined learners' attitude towards the use of CAI in the. teaching of Fine Arts. This.was with a view to providing an intervention .strategy for improving the performance of, students in Fine Arts.The pre-test post-test control group design was employed. The study population consisted of Junior Secondary School (class three)  students in Ife Central Local Government. Three schools we.re purposively 'selected based on the availability of computers. Twenty students were randomly selected from each of  the three schools to constitute two experimental groups and one control group. Two instruments titled"Questionnaire on Attitude to Computer Assisted Instruction"(QACAI,)and "Graphic Tool Utility and Achievement Test"(GTUAT) were used for the study. The GTUAT had a test-retest reliability coefficient of 0.67over an interval of two weeks while the QACAI yielded a split half reliability coefficient of 0.72. Data collected for the study wereanalysed using descriptive and analytical statistics.The results showed a_significant difference between 'the performance of students exposed to problem solving CAI package and those exposed to drill and practise CAI package (t = 2.105, P < 0.05).The problem solving  CAI group (x = 86.75, SD = 11.27) perfomed  than the drill and practice CAI group (X = 79.50, SD = 10.51). The results also showed a significant difference between the performance of learners exposed to drill and practice CAI package and those exposed to the conventional chalk-and-talk m-ethod (t= 7.79, p<0.05) The drill and practice CAI group (X = 79.50, SD = 10.50) performed better than the chalk-and-talk group (X = 52.50, SD = 11.41). Lastly, a significant difference was noted between the performance of learners in the problem solving CAI group and those exposed to the chalk-and-talk method (t =9.54, p<0.05). The problem solving group (X = 86.75, SD = 11.27) performing better than the chalk-and-talk group (X = 52.50, SD =11.41). The result also showed a significant difference between the pre test and post test attitudes of learners in the experimental groups to CAI. A comparison of the pre test and post test attitudes of learners ,in the drill and practice group to CAI showed at value of  6.20 which was significant at 0.05 level while that of the problem solving group showed a significant t value of  5. 51 at 0.05 level. It was concluded that both the problem solving and drill and practice modes of  CAI were effective in improving the performance of  students in Fine Arts and in developing a positive attitude towards computer assisted Instruction.                                                                       |Thesis collection|Computer Assisted Instruction/ Graphic Tool Utility/design skills in Fine Arts/ chalk-and-talk*|||||| Egbowon, Silas Eniola|M|Effects of modes of presentation of videotaped instruction on learners' Aquisition of english language phonology among first yaer university students||||||Ph.D|Akanbi, D.

It also investigated which mode most effectively presented the videotaped instruction and whether  or not learners are favourably disposed towards the use of videotaped instruction for the acquisition of English language phonology skill.This is with theaim of providing an alternative and effective method that can enhance the acquisition of phonology skill in Nigerian universities.The study is a quasi-experimental research. It adopted a 5 x 2 x 4  modified pre-test post-test control design. The population for the study consisted of all the registered First Year English language students in Lagos State University(LASU), Ojo.The  sample was made up of an intact group comprising 125 First Year English language students of Lagos State University, Ojo , who were randomly assigned to four experimental groups and a control group made up of 25 students per group .The research instrument was the Videotaped Instruction on English Language Phonology (VIELP) which was manipulated in four experimental groups, that is ,Repeated and Tested (R+T), Non-repeated but Tested (NR+T), Repeated and Non-Tested (R-NT)and Non-Repeated and Non-Tested (NR-NT) videotaped  instruction groups while the Control Group (CNTRL) was exposed to the conventional chalk and talk classroom teaching. The test instruments were the"Phonology AchievementTest" (PAT) and the Programme Evaluation Questionnaire"(PEQ). The scores obtained were subjected to standard deviation, mean, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Scheffe's Multiple Range Analysis.The result showed that the experimental groups, which were taught usingn locally produced Videotaped Instruction on EnglishLanguage Phonology (VIELP) performed significantly better (F = 14.4325, df = 4, 120, P < 0.05) than the group taught with conventional classroom method. The result also showed that a significant difference existed between the pairs of Repeated and Tested (R+T) andNon-repeated but Tested (NR+T) videotaped instruction groups; Repeated and Tested (R+T) and Non-repeated and Non-tested (NR-NT) videotaped instruction "groups; Repeated and Tested (R+T) videotape instruction group and the Control (CNTRL) group. Also, both pairs of  Non-repeated but Tested (NR+T) and Repeated and Non-tested (R-NT) videotaped instruction groups showed that a significant difference existed between each of them and the Control. Finally,the result showed that no two groups are significantly different regarding the students' attitude towards the use of videotaped instruction (F = 0.1463, df = 3, 96, p >0.05). The study concluded that repetition and immediate testing enhanced  learning with videotaped instruction. Therefore, repeated and tested (R+T) videotaped instruction is a very effective mode of  presentation that can enhance learners' acquisition of English language phonology in Nigerian universities.

It was carried out as a response to the need to seek viable strategies that could enrich the teaching' of library.skills to students just entering the tertiary level of education.Two hundred and forty students selected by stratified random sampling were assigned to four groups, A, B, C, and D, each presented with a different learning package. Group A was given the complete package of flowcharted advance organizer plus the learning material.Group B was given the learning material only while Group C was given only the flowcharted advance organizer. Group D was given the placebos. Six hypotheses were generated for the study. With the aid of two instruments, the Library Skills Mastery Test (LSMT) and the Library Skills Transfer Test (LSTT), data were collected and analysed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the t-tests.The t-tests were followed by further analysis using the Least Significant Difference (LSD) method. All the hypotheses were tested at the 0.05 level of significance.The results of the study revealed that the flowcharted advance organizer plus the learning material group (Group A) did not perform significantly better than the learning material only group (Group B). The results further revealed that the group exposed to the flowcharted advance organizer plus the learning material (Group A) and the group exposed to the learning material only (Group B) performed significantly better than the control group (Group D) that was not exposed to either ofthe treatments; both Group A and Group B were significantly better than the flowcharted advance organizer only (Group C). It was also found that the enhanced performance of the flowcharted advance organizer plus the learning material group. (Group A) and the learning material only group {Group B) was most noticeable on the achievement test.Finally it was found that the learning material (LM) was the most important element of the learning packages presented to the groups.|theses collection|library.skills/flowcharted/ANOVA/advance organizer*||||||Abiona,  Olatunde Olusesan |M|Development of a framework for optimizing access to wide area network resources||||||Ph.D|Kehinde, L.

This \\as done to determine which host or application is generating the most traffic with a view to managing limited network resources efficiently.The software aspect of the network traffic monitoring system consisted of a wrapper script written in Perl language and other open source programs such as IPTraf, Multi Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG) and Webalizer. The wrapper script started the IPTraf program with suitable argument and sorted the output of IPTraf based on Internet Protocol (IP) address and protocol. The program was designed to restart every 30 minutes in order to ensure effective data gathering, maintain system stability, and minimize memory leaks. The traffic management was based on a cyclic multicast proxy server which was simulated using OPNET IT GURU Academic Edition version 9.1. During the simulation the following performance parameters: delay, response time and ethernet load were used to provide performance analysis between the proposed cyclic multicast proxy server and the caching proxy server.The results of the traffic analysis showed that over 80% of the traffic was Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP), 10% Domain Name Service (DNS), 5% Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) and about 3% File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Subsequently, MRTG produced a graphical overview of the traffic pattern while Webalizer produced a detailed analysis of the traffic pattern. The results of the simulation showed that in both single and multiple traffic types the global Ethernet delay experienced by the cyclic multicast server was about 20% lower than that of the existing caching server. Similarly, HTTP page response time was over 10% lower for cyclic multicast than for the cachingserver. The Ethernet load for single traffic was about 7% lower for cyclic multicast than for the caching proxy server and about 13% lower for multiple traffic.In conclusion, the cyclic multicast proxy server was found to provide a superior performance and scale better at higher traffic loads.|theses collection|wide area network/multi router traffic grafher/webalizer/hypertext transfer  protocol/file transfer protocol/proxy server*||||||Akinnawonu, Benson Monehin |M|A Critical Analysis of the Causal Theory of Perception. ||||||Ph.D. Philosophy|Makinde, M.

It examined the consequences of the causal theory on knowledge of the external world in relation to sense data and their objects. The study defended causal theory  of perception through a naturalized philosophy of mind. The objective was to show the futility of  avoiding causal talk in references to physical objects.The method of critical/conceptual analysis was employed in the review and analysis of existing literature on causal and non-causal theories of perception, with particular focus on sense datum theory, phenomenalism, reliabilism and naturalism. The methodology also included a critical study of the computational theory of mind in Neuroscience and other related theories of  perception in Psychology. The study established that perceptual objects were determined by causal antecedents of perceptual experience. It showed that the relation between physical objects and their qualities was causal. It also demonstrated that seeking for a theory of mind purely on a priori ground, and trying to account for perceptual awareness of physical objects in terms of brain functions or identification of neural correlates of conscious experience alone were erroneous. Although the explanation of the relation between physical objects and their qualities involved a priori considerations,  physical descriptions of conscious experience could not be ruled out. Neither a descriptive nor a priori method of explanation of the relation between physical objects and their qualities would suffice conceived exclusively of each other.The study concluded that it is possible to accommodate the mind within a naturalistic framework, and that the relation between physical objects and their qualities is causal. This showed that there was a regularity or unity that implies objective laws in nature.|Thesis collection| a priori ground/causal antecedents/sense datum theory/Neuroscience/naturalized philosophy *
