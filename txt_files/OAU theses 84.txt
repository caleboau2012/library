The potentialities for tourism in Nigeria are many, but her tourism resources are yet to be fully developed.  The success of the tourism sector in this country has continuously been hampered by the general lack of primary infrastructures and services needed for tourism and a weak organizational machinery.  The totality of these shortcomings makes tourism a fertile but fallow sector, despite the comparatively huge investments in Nigeria.In this study the methodology involved relevant literature review, carrying out sample survey by questionnaire and analyzing the data collected.  Past efforts to develop tourism in Ondo State have been largely concentrated on the development of Ikogosi Warm Spring which is the focus of this study.  Measures taken to develop other tourist attraction centres, which fortunately abound in the state, amount to piece-meal.  In addition to the lack of primary infrastructural facilities in the existing tourist centres, there is also a dearth of trained personnel, substandard hotels and associated services, and poor transport facilities.Despite the greater attention focused on the development of Ikogosi Warm Spring, the achievements of the centre still fall short of expectations.  Efforts, so far, have been concentrated on the development of chalets, most of which are under utilized, while neglecting other relevant facilities and services like electricity, water supply and catering.The various steps taken in the past are not sufficient to achieve the required standard for tourism in the state.  It is necessary therefore, to prepare a Master Plan for tourism development in the state and evolve a tourism policy with the aim of upgrading, evaluating and effectively promoting tourism in and outside the state.  Due consideration for the provision of adequate facilities, utilities and an effective promotional strategy is recommended at the end of this study for proper development of the tourist centres in Ondo State.|Theses collection|Tourism development in Nigeria/Tourism resources*||||||Moro, Dauphin  Dighitoghi|Male|A study of bacterial species of the endocervix of infertile and fertile women attending fertility clinic in Ile - Ife.||||||M.

Both the vagina and cervix harbour various microorganisms. Endocervical colonization by pathogens have been reported to cause morbidity of the reproductive system which may result in infertility and congenital malformation in the foetus. Information relating to endocervical microflora of Nigerian women is scarce in the literature hence this study. The objectives of the study are : isolation and identification of microbes in the endocervix of infertile and pregnant women in Ile-Ife, determination and comparison of host factors contributing to microbial colonization and determination of the in-vitro antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the isolates.Endocervical cultures from one hundred and seventy eight women consisting of 92 infertile and 86 pregnant women were processed. The primary isolation media used were blood agar, eosin-methylene blue agar, mannitol salt agar, sabouraud dextrose agar, Thayer-Martin agar, brain heart infusion broth and cooked meat medium. The isolates were identified based on cultural, morphological and biochemical characteristics. Wet mount and direct Gram's stain of each endocervical swab was also made on clean glass slides for microscopy. Antibiotic susceptibility pattern of bacteria was determined by the disc diffusion method while the medical histories of participants were obtained from their case notes and questionnaire method was also used. Data were statistically analysed using the Chi-square technique.A total of three hundred and sixty seven microbial isolates were recovered with 203 (55.3%) from the infertile women and 164 (44.7%) from the pregnant.  Forty six percent of the total bacterial isolates from the infertile women and forty-eight percent of those from the pregnant women were pathogens.  These included Neisseria gonorrhoeae which constituted 19.7%, Staphylococcus aureus, 18.7%, beta haemolytic streptococci 4.4% and Clostridium sp, 3.9% of the isolates cultured from the infertile women.   Similarly, N. gonorrhoeae was recovered from 17%, S. aureus 14.6%, beta haemolytic streprococci 10.4% and Clostridium sp 6.1% of the total isolates from the pregnant women.  Other organism isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus sp, Bacillus sp, coagulase negative staphylococci (CONS), Candida sp and Trichomonas vaginalis.  Similar organisms were cultured from both groups of women.The result showed that 17.5% of the infertile women from whom N. gonorrhoeae was isolated had history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), 10% had history of bilateral tubal occlusion (BTO) and 2.5% with cervicitis.  Similarly, 10.5% of the infertile women from whom S. aureus were cultured had PID, 13.2%, BTO and 5.3% cervicitis.  Altogether, 68 (73.9%) of the infertile women had secondary infertility which was about three times more frequent compared to 24 (26.1%) with primary infertility.  The bacteria cultured from their endocervix showed multiple antibiotic resistance to commonly employed antibiotics.  The study revealed bacterial colonization of the endocervix of infertile and pregnant women with pathogens specifically N. gonorrhoeae which is of concern to their neonates particularly those delivered through the birth canal.  The study also revealed the prevalence of antibiotic resistant organisms among the participants.|Theses collection|Bacterial species/bacterial species of the endocervix of infertile and fertile women*||||||Akinwole, Philips Olugbemiga|Male |Microenvironmental preferences of soil dwelling mites on the floor of a secondary regrowth forest in Ile-Ife||||||M.

This is to know the possible influence of moisture content and temperature on the different species as well as to determine the seasonal variation in the age structure of each species. The work also aimed at breeding selected groups of the mites in the laboratory so as to know their feeding preference.Sampling was done monthly from August 2002 to April 2003 covering the two seasons of the annual cycle. On each sampling occasion, soil samples were taken from three layers of the topsoil from four subplots of a 25 m2 marked out from each of two contrasting habitats (shaded and unshaded area) on the forest floor. Litter samples were collected within a 25 x 25 cm quadrat below which the fermentation and topsoil samples were taken using a soil auger. The soil and litter samples were collected in polythene bags, labeled and brought to the laboratory. Site-specific data on rainfall, soil moisture contents, and soil temperature were simultaneously collected. The samples were extracted for microarthropods in the Berlesse Tullgreen extractor. The mites were later identified to genera or species level and sorted from the rest of the microarthropods under a stereo dissecting microscope. Some of the mites were extracted alive and later used for the breeding experiment.There was an overwhelming predominance of mite populations in the 5 cm topsoil where peak populations reached 54,000 mites per m2 in October 2002, compared with the fermentation and litter layers where peak populations were 7,500 mites per m2 in February 2003 and 12,500 mites per m2 in August 2002 respectively. Microenvironmental differences in the shaded and unshaded plots were reported to have influenced the densities and fluctuation patterns of the mite populations. The large numbers of mites extracted from the topsoil in the shaded plot was attributed to highly conducive moisture conditions provided by the canopy. It was observed that Mesoplophora ifeana had preference for moist conditions during the dry and wet seasons, while Mixacarus spp. appeared to prefer fairly moist condition. Therelatively stable population of M. ifeana and Scheloribates mochlosimilaris in the fermentation layer is a consequence of many interacting microenvironmental factors which include rainfall and temperature.The feeding of members of Polyaspidae and Teleolides on the algae Pleurococcus sp., indicates that they are algivorous browsers. The pteromorphs, namely, S. mochlosimilaris and M inexpectata fed on the yeast and litter filtrate (panphytophagous) and were present in all the three soil layers investigated. It was observed that the active feeding of Pergalumna and Teleolides was responsible for their relatively longer survival in the laboratory when compared with the other taxonomic groups. The rejection of food by Actinedida and Uropodidae suggests that they could be predators or carrion feeders.The study concluded that canopy cover affected the sensitivity of soil dwelling mites on the floor of a secondary regrowth forest with regard to vertical gradients of light, microclimate and foliage quality in a complex way.|Theses collection|Soil dwelling mites / Secondary regrowth forest*||||||Obong, Inyang Akpan|Male|Dairy factory complex: design proposal for Obudu cattle ranch Cross River State||||||M.

This calls for up-to-date and adequate design data. The research is a study for collection of necessary design data, establishment of the design criteria and the application of such to a dairy factory complex.The general policy for industrialisation and dairy development has been reviewed. Existing factories have been analysed, to establish deficiencies. The climatology of the project location has been examined and environmental design criteria established for the micro-climate.It has been discovered that, at both national and state levels, there are well formulated policies on industrial development. Although there is increase in industrial development; dairy industry development is very low because of low investment. The creation of dairy development authority to be in charge of dairy development is recommended.in the design of the factory, high hygienic condition, limitation to only inorganic materials, high energy consumption and complex services system have been identified as the design constraints. Thus sterilization unit for workers entering the factory, elimination of external polluted air, insulation for floor, roof and wells to reduce heat intake from outside are recommended.In addition to functional space planning, the.provision of adequate welfare facilities for the workers, will motivate them and enhance greater efficiency.|Theses collection|Dairy factory complex / Obudu cattle ranch Cross River State*||||||Adeola, Olukemi Anthony|Female|FINANCIAL  MANAGEMENT  PRACTICES  IN GRADE  TWO  TEACHERS COLLEGES IN OYO STATE, NIGERIA.||||||M.

The proto-Dahomey depocentre was a simple downwarped faulted basin. The deposits constitute part of a larger West African -Brazilian intercratonic sedimentary sequence.The inception of the basin is related to the tensional forces that culminated in the separation of the African plate from the South American plate. Tectonism was mainly controlled by Mesozoic fracture zones and faults, such as the Chain, Romanche and Charcot Fracture Zones.The geology is dominated by a series of parallel to Subparallel faults, trending in a northeast to southwest direction. Vertical displacements led to the developmentof horst and grabens which controlled sedimentation. Sediment cover is moderated thick and there are no evidences of metamorphism or volcanism. The basin is thus a miogeosynclinal type. The sedimentary record is complicated by the occurrence of many unconformities and hiatuses.Sedimentation was syntectonic. Various postdrift episodes of transgression and regression were well preserved. The sediments are mainly classics, ranging from conglomerates and through sands and limestones to shales and marls.Geophysical evidences show that the sediments pinch out against the Basement Complex. This makes the Cretaceous sands (Afowo Formation) a good target for oil exploration,since it is overlain by the shaley  Araromi Formation, a possible cap rock.The fact that heavy oil and tar had been discovered in the Nigerian sector and high grade light crude in the offshore of the Benin Republic suggest a possible occurrence of light crude in the offshore of the Nigerian sectorDitch cutting samples studied yielded 50 species of Foraminifera including 6 new species. The three newly erected Cretaceous formations of Omatsola and Adegoke (1981) were characterised for the first time with their responses on geophysical logs.A model for the tectonic evolution of the Dahomey Basin is proposed.|Theses collection|Dahomey Basin*||||||Afolayan, S.

It provides as a baseline, information on the pre-colonial Igbomina society, especially on those institutions that the British either built upon and used or destroyed.  Pre-colonial Igbomina was under the suzerainty of the Fulani who were operating the Ijia (District Head) system of government from Ilorin and Lafiagi.  This arrangement was incorporated and adapted by the British.  The system, hitherto oppressive, became even more oppressive during the colonial period.	The operation of this system was further reinforced by the colonial disregard for traditional practices, the trampling on, and undermining of, the powers of traditional rulers.  This, coupled with the colonial economic exploitation, generated hostile reactions in Igbomina.  The result was riots, agitation for the creation of more local governments and a call for independence from foreign rule.  Attempts by the British to solve one crisis only produced others.  This chain reaction continued until 1960 when the country attained independence.	The colonial period, however, witnessed a number of socio-economic changes in the ways of life of the people: roads were constructed, schools and hospitals were built and a new religion, Christianity, was successfully introduced.|Theses collection|Igbomina under colonial rule*||||||Ajayi, Gabriel Oladipupo.|Male|A design proposal for general post office, Akure.||||||M.

The general increase in the level of education and the urbanisation phenomena in Nigeria in recent years, are some of the contributing factors to this urgent demand..The design of a General post office building that will solve the shortcomings and promote the efficiency of the existing one at Akure requires a systematic development.It is in the light of this that the study of the climatic conditions of the study area and physical condition of the site are carried out. This will make it easy to develop adequate design responses to humidity, radiation, heat, rain and other inclement weather. Furthermore, in order to generate a realistic and meaningful General post office design, an analytical survey of same existing post offices in the country including the existing one at Akure was taken.It was found from the survey that spaces allocated for uses within the building are inadequate, there were conspicuous lack of shading devices to limit sun penetration into the interior and the lumping of the inward and outward sorting section together  i n  thesame roam which results in functional conflict.Therefore, in order to alleviate these problems, due consideration was given to the provision of the necessary facilities and services like car parking spaces, staff canteen, training  centre among others, in the design proposal at the end of this study to enhance functionality and

It is hypothesized that except for the very few who are privileged with secondary or higher education, the educational status of females is improving only slightly. This study therefore, investigated the effects of some family characteristics (mainly family structural variables) on female educational aspirations in Oyo State secondary schools of Nigeria.Three hundred and fifty nine female secondary school students drawn from six randomly chosen local government areas of Oyo State were involved in the study. Data were collected with the use of questionnaires.  Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used in the analysis.About one-quarter of the respondents were found to be of low educational aspirations, while seventy percent of them had medium level of aspiration and about five percent had high aspirations. Positive significant relationships were round between the female students' educational aspirations and parental levels of education., types of occupation, fathers' material possession scores, sisters' levels of educational attainments and the students' scholastic performances Both fathers' and mothers' levels of education have almost equal positive effects on the students' aspirations. However the fathers' types of occupation seem to be a more important factor for the students' educational aspirations.Family size, number of wives in the family and students' ages were also found to have significant negative correlations with the students' educational aspirations. Students' order of birth although negatively correlated was not significant. There were also significant differences between the urban and rural family students in their scholastic performances and educational aspirations.On the basis of the findings, it was recommended that there should be deliberate governmental interventions to raise rural dwellers levels of living.

In the first few years of independence, three areas of external relations received emphasis  the Commonwealth, the OAU and the United Nations. When Nigeria joined the Commonwealth in 1960, it was optimistic about its usefulness, hoping to benefit diplomatically and economically.However events after 1960, as this study shows, betrayed this optimism. But for the successful struggle  in 1961 for the expulsion of South Africa from the Commonwealth, other aspirations were unfulfilled; there were little or no economic advantages; the body did not do much to help Zimbabwe in the struggle for independence and Nigeria witnessed a civil war which Commonwealth members failed to resolve.By 1970, the relationship with the Commonwealth was being assessed, not by the government, which still preferred membership, but by the people who pointed out the ineffectiveness of the organisation. The muchtalked about machinery for consultation was not of much use, as Britain, the core of the association, continued to act as she deemed fit, even when opinion in the Commonwealth ran counter to her actions. It was also pointed out that during the civil war in Nigeria  the body could not reach a common line of action. Finally, as an economic body, it did not prove itself a useful organisation.|Theses collection| Nigeria and  the Commonwealth                                                                                                                                               *||||||Adegoke Sola Adetunla.|Male|Advertising in a television media ||||||MBA Business Administration|John Weinrich||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Management and Accounting|1981|||OAU|||||ix, 133p.|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

It was necessary, therefore, to study the commercial activities of N.T.V., Ibadan, from its inception in October, 1959 when the first African Television station was established in Ibadan.Since its inception, it is noticed that N.T.V., Ibadanhas, therefore, experienced many changes in its promotional strategy. Hence, the historical background and the theory of Television commercial promotion are presented in order to provide a foundation for the analysis.Among the recommendations made to improve television commercial advertising in Nigeria generally and the commercial department in particular, are to decentralise its operations, implement a participative management style, zonal transmitting stations should be installed, a data bank should be developed concerning audience attention, awareness, and response, and additional support should be given to research into The Profiles of Nigerian consumers.|Theses collection|Advertising / Television media*||||||Akinwumi, Isaac  Oyedele|Male|Comparing basics skills between formally trained and non-formally trained Nigerian Blacksmiths||||||M.

The researcher compared the quality of the curricula which apprentices inboth systems were exposed to by evaluating the quality of copies of matchets made by the apprentices when they were given prototype matchets. Three hypotheses were raised to compare the skills of formally and non-formally trained apprentices;1)	on precision at copying;2)	material selection; and3)	qualities of end-product.Students of the Technical Colleges of Oyo and OwO respectively constituted the formally trained apprentices, while blacksmith apprentices randomly selected in Oyo and Ondo States constituted their non-formally trained counter parts. The subjects were given a made in Birmingham matchet each to copy and reproduce. Matchets produced by both groups were scored. The 't' test analysis of the performances of the two groups at level 0.01, df 48, yielded the following results for skills in:-1)	copying precisely tc = 14.83 > tt = 2.68;2)	material selection tc = 17.82 > tt = 2.68; and3)	finesse of end-product tc = 23.89 > tt = 2,68. The differences were significant in favour of the non-formally trained apprentices. It follows therefore that: Non-formally trained apprentices performed better in all the skills tested than their counterparts in formal institutions. The study reveals that the curriculum offered by non-formal (traditional) apprenticeship system is more effective than that offered by formal apprenticeship system. It is therefore suggested that the non-formal (traditional) apprenticeship system should be up-dated so that it can be suitable for the further training of junior high school graduates in various indigenous vocational skills.|Theses collection|Formally trained and non-formally trained Nigerian Blacksmiths*||||||Alao, Nathaniel Olusola|Male|The effect of palm oil on selected engineering materials                   ||||||M Sc.

The effect of these combinations of parameters on the stress-strain relationship and creep behaviour for rubber was also studied.A 23 Factorial experiment was designed with moisture content, Temperature and time as variablesand the selected metals were subjected to the different combinations of effects. The total corrosion, rate of corrosion and also the percentage of metal corroded were determined for the metals and on these basis, the time of exposure of these metals had significant effects on the corrosion rates of the metals in palm oil and also any of the metals can be used as materials for the components of pump for pumping palm oil and storage tanks for storing it.An understanding of the contributions of the three parameters on the corrosion rates, total corrosion and percentage of metal corroded in palm oil, is gained if the relationship between the factors and the free fatty acid level is studied.The effectiveness of rubber which is potentially useful as seal material to be used in a pump for pumping palm oil, depends largely on the rigidity while in service. The stress-strain relationships and creep curves for rubber were developed and the average elastic modulus (a measure of rigidity) was estimated. The Elastic Modulus of rubber was affected in varying degrees depending on the condition of the experiment.|Theses collection|Corrosion under different combinations of moisture content /  Creep behaviour for rubber*||||||Anyaegbu, Geoffrey Okechukwu Dike|Male|Design proposal for a community centre at Amichi-Anambra  state||||||M.Sc.

The undesirable effects have been felt in the various communities in the nation in general, and in Amichi, in particular. The major causes of this problem have been identified as lack of amenities and employment opportunities in the rural areas. A lasting solution to it will involve obtaining a fairly balanced development between the rural communities and urban centres, by the provision of amenities such as Educational, Social and Cultural facilities, as well as employment opportunities, in the rural areas.A well composed and functional community centre with other associated amenities will provide most of these required facilities and employment opportunities in the community.To produce a functional community centre, the justification for it in this area, Amichi, and its possible integration into the culture was carried out through a review of literature on the town and environs, the people and culture, government policies on such centres, and oral interviews with a cross section of the people (users) and community leaders (clients).Furthermore, a critical appraisal of some existing community centres within and outside the country was done in order to establish standards, forms, spatial composition and managerial efficiency which form the guidelines for the design proposal.Then, to ensure, proper integration of the designproposal of a court-yard concept for the COMMUNITY CENTRE FOR AMICHI, which in its functional context and spatial composition, would provide public facilities for the education and the entertainment of the community. This would promote community solidarity, craft commercial services, social and cultural development and employment opportunities in the area.|Theses collection|Rural-Urban Migration  / Community disintegration                             *||||||Ayeni, Musa.

Many strategies based on the philosophy of seismic wave propagation in various complex geological environments are employed in practical schemes, often referred to as algorithms, for deconvolution.A number of deconvolution schemes namely Wiener, Kalman, Homomorphic and Minimum Entropy have been reviewed in this study. A detailed study of Wiener least squares filter has led to a modified filter development based on the minimization of the least squares error and a more efficient desired output. Various examples are given to illustrate this development.

The objective was to investigate the extent to which principals actually performed their roles (instructional, administration, human relations) as perceived by their reference groups (teachers, students) and principals themselves.The instrument used in the study was a thirty-item questionnaire tagged "Principals' Roles Perception and Performance Questionnaire (PRPPQ)". This questionnaire was designed to elicit responses of teachers, students and principals' perception and performance on principals roles in three functional areas, namely; instructional, administrative and human relations. A total of five hundred and sixty respondents, made up of 35 principals, 175 teachers and 350 students from 35 randomly selected secondary schools were interviewed. The data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics.The results showed that the principals were qualified and experienced and exhibited high level of effective performance in administrative and human relation roles as compared to instructional roles. Variations however abound between the principals' perception of their expected instructional, administrative and human relation roles and their actual performance of these roles.Thus, principals in Osun state secondary schools can generally improve upon the actual performance of their instructional, administrative and human relation roles through encouragement and motivation by the state's Ministry of Education.|Theses collection|Principals' role perception and performance / Secondary Schools*||||||Chilakpu, Desmond Ogbona|Male|A Mathematical model of cool flames||||||M.

The reaction is assumed to be a two-step Arrhenius irreversible reaction. This problem is then generalized to take care of many other gaseous two-step reactions. Of particular interest are the time of ignition and conditions necessitating separation into two or more flames.We employ large activation energy asymptotics to study the unsteady and steady equations. Appropriate approximations were made so that analytical solutions were obtained.

Three attitudinal questionnaires plus a 50-item multiple-choice achievement test were the research instruments used to collect data. Correlation analysis, t-test analysis, and analysis of variance were used to analyse the data. The significance of the statistics obtained were considered adequate at the 0.05 level.Results of the analyses showed that:A discrepancy between teacher's grade and students' expectation has significant effecton a student's attitude toward himself.2.     A discrepancy between teacher's grade and students' expectation has no significant effect on a student's attitude toward the teacher.3.	A discrepancy between teacher's grade and student's expectation has significant effect on a student's attitude toward his subject or course of study.In addition to the above, it was also found that the accuracy of a student's self-assessment is though not significantly related to academic discipline (B.A. or B.Sc.), but is moderately related to academic standing. Further, females were able to predict their grades more accurately than males.It was therefore suggested that teachers should have significant regard to both the validity of the questions they set and of the grades that are usually returned to students. Course advisers and counsellors are also urged to encourage students to make realistic academic goals and follow these up with realistic efforts.|Theses collection|Teachers' grades and students' expectation / Students' attitude*||||||Badmus, Aliu Alabi|Male|Farm-size and production efficiency among maize farmers in Ilorin and Asa Local Government Areas of Kwara State||||||M.

The Decree stipulates a maximum allocation of 500 hectares of land to an individual for agricultural purposes and 5,000 hectares for grazing. In spite of the abundant supply of arable land in the country there is still a need to use this resource efficiently. To guide the allocation of land under this Decree the capacity of farmers to efficiently utilise land allocated to them has to be determined for various crops and different parts of the country.The present study investigated the relationship between farm size and production efficiency among maize farmers in Ilorin and Asa Local Government Areas of Kwara State, Data were collected on socio-economic backgrounds of farmers and also on costs and returns various sizes of maize farms. The data were summarised and analysed, Regression analysis was also carried out.The results of the analyses indicated that the size of farm affects the efficiency of production. Net returns rose for - 41.51/ha on the 0.1 - 0.9 hectare farms to a maximum of 416.86/ha on the 2.0 - 2.9 hectare farms. It declined on bigger sites. The optimum size of farm among the farmers under study was found to lie between 2.0 and 2.9 hectares. The results of the production function analyses showed that the farmers were prodcing at a decreasing return.   Their resources were also not efficiently allocated.  They under-utilised modern inputs and labour while they over-utilised traditional farm implements.  The study revealed that 69.5 per cent of the farmers have their farms below the optimum size and identified finance as their constraint.  It was therefore suggested that the government should ease the process of granting loans to farmers to facilitate the expansion of farms.|Theses collection|Farm-size / production efficiency / maize farmers*||||||Akinwande, Kayode Ibikeye|Male|Comparative effects of drugs on reptilian atrial muscles||||||M.

After blockade with B-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, the pD2 values of phenylephrine were 5.90 and 5.25 for lizard and tortoise driven atria respectively.In spontaneously-beating atria of the lizard, tortoise and guinea-pig, the positive chronotropic effects induced by isoprenaline, noradrenaline, adrenaline and tyramine were competitively inhibited by propranolol, while phentolamine proved to be ineffective.  Phenylephrine induced a B-adrenoceptor mediated positive chronotropic effect in lizard and tortoise isolated atria at 270C.  In guinea-pig spontaneously-beating atria, however, phenylephrine had no effect on the rate of contraction at 270C; but at 170C, a positive chronotropic response was obtained.The results presented suggest that reptilian atrial muscles respond differently to certain drugs when compared with conventional mammalian atrial muscles.|Theses collection|Drugs / Reptian atrial muscles*||||||Odilora, Chris Akwuba|Male|Thermal stability studies on vinyl chloride polymer||||||M.

Previous work has shown that these metal soaps have special ability to stabilize PVC against thermal degradation both via ester exchanging reactions with labile chlorine in the polymer backbone, and by scavenging hydrogen chloride.The effect of 2%, 3% and 5% concentrations of lead and zinc soaps, and lead/zinc soap mixtures of varying chain lengths on thermal degradation of PVC was investigated.  Results obtained by IR and UV spectroscopy and weight loss studies in air showed a dramatic influence of these soaps on PVC degradation.  Greatest stabilization was observed with PbC12.  Increase in colouration of the polymer/lead soap mixture following thermal degradation was suggested to be due to decomposition of the lead soap rather than the polymer itself.  Colour suppression by zinc soap which was accompanied by significant weight loss was discussed in terms of the soap catalyzing cross-linking of the polymer.  With lead/zinc soap mixtures, there were indications that synergism is occurring in the stabilization.  The relative importances of stabilization by lead and zinc soaps in these mixtures are discussed.Preliminary thermogravimetric analysis results of the thermal degradation of PVC in the presence of these soaps in a Nitrogen atmosphere are also reported.	                                                                             |Theses collection|Thermal stability / vinyl chloride polymer*||||||Akinwumi, Isaac Oyedele|Male|Effectiveness of feedback-remedial measure in the learning of secondary school Physics||||||PhD.

The methods were Specific Feedback Remedial (SFR), Specific Feedback Only (SFO) and the Conventional Method (CM).   Effectiveness was determined by the level of performance of subjects that were exposed to each method.  Attitude modifications in subjects that were exposed to the three methods were also compared.	Four hundred and eighty senior secondary one (SSI) students were randomly selected to constitute the sample.  Group  based instructional package on the concept of motion was constructed based on physics SSS Syllabus by CESAC.  Specific remedial packages were also constructed to enable subjects who were deficient in certain areas of each weeks work to remediate for such deficiencies.  The subjects concerned used the specific remedial packages as self learning devices.  The instruments developed and validated for the study were the cognitive pretest, post-achievement test, diagnostic test, and attitude towards physics scale.  After independent induction sections, teachers assigned to the SFR and SFO groups used the Group-based instructional package to teach the concept of motion to subjects in the two groups for a period of nine weeks.  At the end of each week, the SFR and SFO teachers administered a diagnostic test on the subjects in the SFR and SFO groups.  Feedback was also provided.  Subjects in the SFR and SFO groups were thus able to detect areas where specific learning difficulties existed.  Subjects in the SFR group were given specific remedial packages to correct specific learning difficulties while subjects in the SFO group were not given such packages.  The subjects in the CM group were taught the concept of motion using the lecture method.  The group did not have the weekly diagnostic tests and specific remedial packages.  The attitude towards physics scale was administered on all the subjects in the groups namely SFR, SFO, CM and CON which was the control, before the pretest was given.  The same attitude towards physics scale was also administered after the post-test was given.  The data collected were statistically analysed using mean scores, ANOVA, ANCOVA, Scheffes pairwise comparison test and multiple t-tests.	The results showed that the SFR individuals performed higher in a physics achievement test (percent mean gain in score 46.00%) than the SFO (29.49%) and the CM group (10.00%).  The results of the ANCOVA showed that the SFR group performed significantly higher in the physics achievement test than the SFO and the CM groups    (P < 0.01).  Results of the ANCOVA also showed that the SFR group performed significantly higher in a physics retention test than the SFO and the CM groups (P < 0.01).  The subjects in the SFR group cultivated a more positive attitude towards physics than the subjects in the SFO and the CM groups as revealed by ANOVA test (P < 0.01).  Performance of boys and girls were comparable in the SFR group while boys performed higher than girls in the SFO and CM groups (P < 0.01).

The study also examined the number of organized groups co-opted into the programme and the level of their involvement.  It investigated the difference between the programmes planning and administration in the three local government areas.	Two hundred and ten subjects were selected for the study.  Stratified random sampling technique was used in the selection which involved Local Inspectors of Education (LIE), Local Adult Education Officers (LAEO), Adult Literacy Education Programme Supervisors (ALEPS), Adult Literacy Education Instructors (ALEI) and adult learners grouped into regular clients (RCG), the dropped-out (DOG) and graduated ones (GRG).  The study lasted eight months, May  December 1991, and it involved eighteen literacy centres equally chosen from both towns and villages in the three local government areas.  Questionnaires, Observation Sheets, Oral Interview and Achievement tests otherwise called End-of-Cycle test were used to collect data for the study.  The data collected were analysed using simple percentages, one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-test for all the hypotheses generated for the study.

The para-substituents were classified into electron-donating (for P-NH2, P-CH3 CONH, and P-CH3 substituents) and electron-withdrawwing groups (for the P-NO2 substituents).	Substrate-surfactant interactions occur particularly above the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the surface-active agent.  The effect of this interaction on the hydolysis rate, whether it is an increase or decrease in rate, or no effect may depend on the orientation of the substrate in the micelle, and on the surfactant type and concentration.  Although the presence of different para-substituents have been reported to influence the effect of CTAB on the hydrolysis rate of a number of esters, reports being presented are not in agreement with the literature information.	Using the various para-substituted sulfonyl fluorides did not result in inhibition (in the case of electron-denoting groups) or catalysis (in the case of derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups).  Instead of the expected result, inhibition was observed in all cases.	The kinetic results were analysed using the multi-plot approach.  This analysis clearly indicated that the various substituents were appreciably partitioned into the micellar phase.  Furthermore, the results showed that the various substituents did not determine the degree of micellar stabilization.	Thus, with the sulfonyl fluoride/CTAB system, the extent of interaction may be a primary factor in determining the type of effect observed, instead of the electron activity of the various para substituents.|Theses collection|cationic surfactant / alkaline hydrolysis / benzene sulfonyl fluorides*||||||Ikotun, Titilola Janet|Female|An analysis of the effect of pre and post organizer on the teaching and learning of biological concepts||||||M.

Both chloroquine and aspirin caused degenerative processes in the placenta.  Chloroquine, its polar and non-polar metabolites were demonstrated in the blood and urine of the mother animals whereas only chloroquine and its non-polar metabolites were demonstrated in the fetuses.	Teratogenic activities of chloroquine and aspirin were greatest when the drugs were administered from the 1st to the 10th days of gestation with a peak during the period 6th to the 10th day.  The administration of chloroquine and aspirin to pregnant Wister rats significantly caused a reduction in the litter size, live births and birth weights; whilst it produced significant increase in the intra-uterine and neonatal deaths among the experimental groups.  The greatest significant effects were on the reduction of live birth and increase in the intra-uterine death.	Chloroquine administered to pregnant Wister rats caused varied morphological abnormalities which were first identified during the gestational period 6th to 10th day.  These abnormalities included haemangioma of the brain, deficient calcification of the cranium, spinal-bifida, deficient skeletal calcification, cleft palate and lips, opacity of the lens and cornea, exophthalmia and foetal runts.  Aspirin administration to pregnant Wister rats caused morphological abnormalities in the fetuses which included haemangioma of the brain, deficient calcification of the cranium and phecomelia of both upper and lower limbs.	Administration of chloroquine and aspirin resulted in synergistic reaction with aspirin potentiating the teratogenic action of chloroquine.  Prolonged administration of chloroquine, aspirin, or the combination of the two drugs to pregnant Wister rats was incompatible with foetal viability.

Management structure of the company is the focus of the study.  The determination and allocation of responsibilities and authority in the company has been examined.  Literature review of management structures was undertaken to provide a theoretical model with which to compare the management structure of NIROWI.  The management structure adopted in the company has been analysed.  The compositions and role of the Board of Directors and Management were explained.  The organization hierarchy and the departmentation method adopted in the company were analysed.  The analysis has revealed a centralized authority relationship, lack of delegation, and inadequate coordination and control.  From the analysis it is clear that NIROWI has adopted inappropriate management structure.  A review of operation between the period 1978 and 1980 has shown that the company has been making losses.  Production and sales targets have not been achieved.  Production capacities have been under-utilised resulting in annual losses.  Organisational problems in the company were, also highlighted.  In the section on recommendations and conclusion, a review of the project agreement establishing the company has been suggested.  A new organization structure considered appropriate for the company has also been recommended along with the creation of a number of management committees.|Theses collection|Nigerian-Romanian Wood Industries Limited (NIROWI) /*||||||Kabaija, Ephraimm|Male|Calcium, phos phorus and manganese interactions in the aetiology of perosis in broilers||||||M.

Mn content ranged from 9.1 mg/kg in maize to 145 mg/kg in oyster shell; Ca ranged from 0.03% in maize to 37.5% in oyster shell; and P ranged from 0.01% in palm oil to 14.12% in bone meal.  In general, the commonly used energy sources had lower Ca, P and Mn levels than protein and mineral sources.  The latter were as expected, the richest source of these minerals.	The biological availability of the three elements (Ca, P and Mn) in representative samples of the above three classes of feeds was determined in broilers, using a simple mineral balance technique that made correction for endogenous minerals excretion.  The bio-availability to broilers of the three minerals were: maize (53.9, 40.8, 64.2); ground nut cake (71.1, 59.1, 64.1); fish meal (89.4, 90.4, 93.7); bone meal (94.6, 88.1, 81.3); oyster shell (96.5, 90.6, 99.3) for percent Ca, P and Mn respectively.  Availability of Mn from MnSO4 was 99%.	A factorial design with 3 levels of Ca (0.9, 1.9, 2.9%) and 2 levels of P (0.6, 1.2%) was employed to study the effects of high dietary Ca and P on Mn utilization in broilers.  The level of dietary Mn was 70 mg/kg diet.  Only dietary P had significant effect on broiler performance and mortality, with high dietary P (1.2%) depressing (P<.01) weight gain and efficiency of feed utilization and causing a higher ( P<.01) mortality rate.  The trend was different for parameters on bone characteristics, perosis score and Mn status of the birds for which Ca and P interaction effects were significant (P<.01).  High dietary Ca tended to distrupt Mn metabolism, causing high and severe incidence of perosis and low tibia Mn.  High dietary P attenuated the distruptive effects of high dietary Ca on Mn metabolism. 	Another experiment was carried out to quantify the upward adjustments of dietary Mn required to correct the hazards of dietary Ca and P interaction effect on Mn metabolism.  A total of 150 Cobb-broilers divided into 5 groups of 30 each were fed 5 diets containing increasing levels of Mn (77.5, 140, 200, 255, 300 mg/kg) but similar Ca (2.9%) and P (0.6%) levels for 6 weeks.  Increasing dietary Mn from 77.5 up to and including 200 mg/kg, raised (P<.01) the Mn levels in tibia and feathers and reduced (P<.01) the incidence and severity of perosis.  Above 200 mg/kg diet, there were no additional benefit from the added dietary Mn, suggesting that the detrimental effect of a diet with Ca: P ratio as wide as 4.8:1 on Mn utilization can be controlled by increasing dietary Mn to 200 mg/kg.  A study of the apparent biological availability of Mn in broilers, revealed that the Mn availability fell (P<.01) from 46.3% when dietary Mn was 77.5 mg/kg to 31.1% at the highest dietary Mn level of 300 mg/kg.  Correlation coefficient between dietary Mn and availability was -0.98. ||Calcium, phos phorus and manganese interactions in the aetiology of perosis in broilers*||||||Ekpe, Samuel Eni|Male|An economic analysis of the national accelerated fish production project : a case study of the UTA Ewa Pilot Project||||||M.

Records kept at the Uta Ewa pilot scheme which covered the period between 1977 and 1980 were used.	Fish caught in kilogram was postulated to be a function of labour (effort-day) and the Cobb-Douglas production function was adopted as the most appropriate in evaluating the productivity of labour using the regression analysis.  Profitability of the project was estimated by using cost and returns analysis.	Our results revealed that labour was over utilized, fishermen were not making profit, and that spoilage could affect the profitability of the project.  Government was also indicated for dragging its feet in the implementation of the project.	On the basis of these results, it was recommended that the number of fishing trips made should be increased while the number of operatives in a canoe should be reduced.	Secondly, the capital profile was slated for change to require less labour per unit and to incorporate some storage facilities which will minimize fish spoilage.

The objective is to examine the current arguments in African aesthetics and to identify those theoretically important issues whose resolutions will greatly enrich the discipline.  In pursuance of this objective, the dissertation starts with the exposition and assessment of the main relativists positions in aesthetics.  It examines the issues between the relativist and the universalist and arrives at the conclusion that the anti-universalist and anti-objectivist claims of the relativist rests upon a mistake.  The mistake is the supposition that aesthetic values, concepts and standards are unique to each culture.	Although the dissertation agrees that there is a correlation of aesthetic values with their historical context, it holds that this should not be construed as an evidence that aesthetic values are unique to their culture in any special sense.  Otherwise, the relativist has to show that it is impossible for the aesthetic values of one culture to be exemplified in another.  The position which this dissertation defends is that aesthetic values do not express some definite aesthetic characteristic unique to a particular culture; rather, they exemplify socio-historical conditions.  Hence given similar aesthetic and cultural situations, the same type of aesthetic value will result.	The dissertation concludes by noting the consequences of the relativists theoretical inadequacies on the question of understanding African aesthetics.|Theses collection|African aesthetics / relativism*||||||Ogungbenro, Basiru Mosobalaje|Male|The efficiency of transmission of three isolates of pepper veinal mottle virus by the green peach aphid (myzus persicae sulz.) and the groundnut aphid (aphis craccivora koch.)||||||M.Sc.

It is able to continue active growth and nodulation in the critical period of the dry season when other herbs are dry and quiescent.  It is abundant in soils very low in nitrogen and organic matter.	Three distinct morphological forms are here recognized: a simple-leaved form; a simple-compound-leaved form and a compound-leaved form.	Nitrogen concentrations in the leaves, stem and roots are significantly different within and between the forms.  One form, Jos 1 compound-leaved, appeared to have a different growth rate, and seed germination character also varies among the forms.	The distributions of I. pulchra, grass tussocks and other legumes were found never to be random but to show various scales of contagion.  The local pattern of I. pulchra distribution is largely controlled by grass tussocks and topography (ridging), which are correlated with soil organic matter concentration (and presumably cation exchange capacity and nitrogen concentration).  I. pulchra was found not to be able to compete with tall grasses.	Seeds were treated in concentrated sulphuric acid, boiling water, tap water and by scarification.  The acid treatment gave the highest percentage germination (70  100%) while tap water treatment gave the lowest, (0  1%).	The suggestion is made that I. pulchra can be utilized by seeding into infertile open savanna areas and into managed ranges.  The Jos 1 compound-leaved form is suggested as the most suitable for further investigation and field trials.|Theses collection|indigofera pulchra wild *||||||Badifu, Gabriel Ijegbunam Okei|Male|Evaluation of  'OGI' from red and white sorghum||||||M.

There was an increase, from 3.48 to 3.60 ug/ml for white variety and 3.18 to 3.35 ug/ml for red variety, in thiamine (B1) and slight increase, from 1.06 to 1.11 ug/ml for white variety and 1.07 to 1.13 ug/ml for red variety, in riboflavin (B2) contents within 3-4 days of fermentation, thereafter, a continuous decrease was observed.	Lactic acid reduced the geling or pasting characteristics of sorghum starch.	The swelling and thickening properties of sorghum starch were considerably increased in 3-day fermentation period.  Ogi from red sorghum (R/Ogi) had higher peak viscosity than Ogi from white sorghum (W/Ogi).The gelatinization time and temperature for R/Ogi were shorter and lower respectively than W/Ogi.   R/Ogi showed greater stability than W/Ogi.	A 3-4 day fermentation period for the preparation of Ogi was sufficient to impart desired qualities coupled with some supplementation for human nutrition.	There was no significant difference (P<0.05) in flavour, mouthfeel, degree of sourness between the cooked R/Ogi and W/Ogi.	Both the cooked and uncooked R/Ogi enjoyed a more popular aesthetic acceptability than cooked and uncooked W/Ogi; in other words, R/Ogi was superior or preferred to W/Ogi and this result agreed with the data obtained from amylogram.

These were then analysed through the use of safety-first model, linear programming technique and discriminant analysis.Results from the safety-first model showed that farmers in the study area can be categorized into two namely:  Risk Averse and Risk Preferring.  It also indicated that about 81 per cent of the farmers exhibit risk aversion.  The Linear programming technique showed the effect of risk on the profitability of farmers investments.  Risk preferring farmers were found to be compensated by a higher return on their investment compared to those who exhibit risk averse behaviour.  The discriminant Analysis technique however revealed that socio-economic characteristics such as Land area, level of schooling, off-farm income and membership of farming groups are positively associated with risk bearing.  It also supports the results obtained from the safety-first rule.The implication of the findings is that risk aversion plays a very important role in farmers behaviour within the study area; and in order to improve the risk-bearing ability of farmers, provision should be made for increased membership in farming groups.  Improved education and inspiration to farmers through the provision of extra cultivable land for optimum use are also expected stimulate the risk bearing ability of the farmers for increased agricultural investment and consequently productivity.|Theses collection|Risk and farm investment / Farmers / Odo-Otin local government area of Oyo State, Nigeria*||||||Odewale, J.

Anthers dissected out of the sterilized buds were implanted without their filaments on highly modified Staritskys (1970) medium.The modification on the Staritskys (1970) medium involved a reduction of the sucrose, m-inositol concentrations, and the addition of the following amino acids: alanine, arginine, aspartic acid, glutamine, histidine, lysine, praline, serine, tyrosine and valine.The response of the shock treated anthers to callus initiation was dependent on the type of phytohormone used as well as the period of incubation.The temperature and pH ranges for callus generation were within those normally used for tissue culture experiment but shaking did not produce the desired effect of embryoid formation.Additives like activated charcoal and coconut milk did not bring about callus differentiation, neither did doubling the concentration of iron and magnesium within the medium enhance chlorophyll development.Environmental factors like temperature, pH and shaking did not affect callus growth within the ranges used.Variation in auxin and cytokinin concentration showed only the difference in budding ability of the generated callus.|Theses collection|callus induction / oil palm*||||||Oyebisi, Timothy Oyedepo|Male|Design and construction of a  potentiometric titrator||||||M.

The major findings among others in this work are as follows:(i)	That although administrative effectiveness of an organization like local government goes a long way to improve its performances yet it is not true to say that all problems of local government revolves around their administrative ineffectiveness alone.(ii)	That not withstanding the administrative effectiveness of the workers in the Council, the ineffectiveness of it can be disrupted by party politics both within and outside the council itself.(iii)	That the successful service deliveries of any council depends to a considerable extent on the caliber of the councilors and the leader-ship traits of both the chairman and the executive secretary.(iv)	That structural instability also affects the performances of the Council.(v)	That lack of funds, and State/Local Government relations have contributed a lot to the problems of Ibadan Municipal Government.(vi)	That the ideas of sending seconded officers to the council has generated lots of unhappiness and disunity and it must be abhorred for the reasons stated in chapters 3 and 7.Method of Research	As a background to the study, I have read many literatures on local government and many other topics.

Rocks of the area include (i) Hornblende-biotite and augen gneisses (ii) the younger metasediments consisting of mica-schist, quartzites, dolomitic marble and amphibolites and (iii) fine to medium grained and the coarse to coarse porphyritic granites which are intrusive into the metamorphic rocks.	A total of 210 representative samples of the various rock units were studied petrographically and analysed for both major and trace elements contents.  The hornblende-biotite gneiss is geochemically characterized by high values of CaO + Na20 (average = 6.76%), low average K2O (2.23%) and high Na20/K2O ratio (average = 1.70) all of which suggest its derivation from a greywacke-like parent rock.	Petrographic observations on the augen gneiss together with its geochemical characteristics, particularly the low K/Rb ration (average = 171), the high K20 + Na20 (average = 7.75%), the high K2O/Na2O ratio (average = 3.35) and the high average Rb/Sr ratio (3.76) as compared to the corresponding and respective values in the hornblende-biotite gneiss and the crust suggest strong overprints of metasomatic effects on the original rock which could have been a biotite gneiss.	Though texturally different, the Igbeti granites are generally calc-alkali to weakly alkali in composition, show strong indications of genetic relationships and were probably emplaced at PH2O below 10 K bars.  Their average K/Rb (208), Rb/Sr (0.68), Ba/Sr (2.29), Ba/Rb (3.53), K/Ba (67.73) ratios and Sr87/Sr86 = 0.7120 + 0.0016 of the Igbeti granites suggest crustal affinity hence it is proposed that the granite magma is of lower crustal origin but with complex evolutionary history.	The alkali feldspar geochemistry, field relationships and other geochemical characteristics of the granites indicate that the magma was highly viscous, poor in volatiles, slightly differentiated and was not markedly contaminated by the surrounding rocks.|Theses collection|Igbeti Granite Complex Oyo State, Nigeria*||||||Odubanjo, Cordelia Olatokunbo|Male|Optimum housing for low-/middle-income Nigerians (Oyo State) : the growth factor||||||M.

When that roof is his to call his own, his degree of contentment leaves only a few things (if any) to be desired. If, in addition, he is able to adapt his dwelling to suit immediate needs, his sense of fulfilment can best be imagined, not described. It is considerations of this nature that have led to the present literary effort.The work is centred on providing the low-and middle-income groups the opportunity to own a house which has built-in growth potentials. Each unit is proposed to be able to "grow,' in response to need for more space (through increase in family-size) or to reflect change in economic standing. In spite of subsequent developments being on an individual basis, they are to conform to prescribed guidelines, such that, at any given time, effective control of the architectural environment is maintained.The study is divided into three main parts: Part A is, essentially, the introduction, and contains Chapter One which states the aims and objectives of the research; Part B (Chapters Two, Three and Four) is the result of the analysis undertaken, and deals with case-studies, income-levels in the Nigerian economy and the questionof rent; the last part, Part C (Chapters Five to Ten) is the Proposal, and makes recommendations both of policy and design, at the same time exploring strategies for cost-reduction and general implementation.|Theses collection|Housing / low-/middle-income Nigerians*||||||Ubaru, Moses Obioma|Male|Design of a programmable digital process controller for a chemical process plant||||||M.

Each group was placed in a paddock of 0.4 hectare. Two groups were infected with 2000L3 H. contortus while the other two groups were not infected. One group each from infected and non-infected groups was placed on protein supplement of Leucaena leaves, firstly at 50 g/d for seven weeks and then at 100 g/d for four weeks.Later, stocking rate was increased from 15 lambs/ha to 20 lambs/ha; 25 lambs/ha and 30 lambs/ha consecutively at fortnight intervals.The following measurements were taken: weekly weight gains, packed cell volume (PCV), faecal egg counts and pasture larval count.It was found that the non-infected animals had a daily weight gain of 114.6 g/ram while the infected one had 91.8 g/d; and these were significantly different (P<0.05). Protein supplementationmodified the effects of the infection while the PCV was not significantly affected (P>0.05) either by the infection or protein supplementation as the values ranges between 30.1 to 31.3% There was increase in pasture larval count in the rainy season.

Histamine induced a concentration-dependent negative chronotropic and negative inotropic responses in the rat isolated atria. In the bat isolated atria, histamine produced marked concentration-dependent negative or positive chronotropic and inotropic effects.On the rat isolated right atria, cimetidine on its own, caused a negative chronotropic effect at low concentration (4 x 10-6 M) and small but measurable positive chronotropic effect at higher concentrations (= 8.0 x 10-6 M), Cimetidine did not produce any consistent effect on the rate and amplitude of contraction of the bat atria. Co-administration of cimetidine and mepyr amin caused significant (P<0.05) negative responses on the rate and amplitude of contraction in the two mammals. However, prior administrationof mepyramine enhanced the positive effects of histamine on the amplitude of contraction but reduced the positive chronotropic effect of this agonist on the bat myocardium.Analysis of the present findings showed that histamine H2- receptor stimulation probably mediates the positive effects of histamine on the rate and amplitude of contraction of the bat right atria, while histamine H1- receptor stimulation may be responsible for the inhibitory responses. In the rat isolated atria, both histamine H1-and H2- receptors seem to mediate inhibitory effects of histamine.Reserpinisation of the animals suggests that histamine probably exerts a direct effect on the rat and bat spontaneously-beating right atria.|Theses collection|Pharmacological analysis / histamine receptors / mammalian atrial muscles*||||||Itaman, Joseph Onomhanria|Male|Correlative studies on some physical properties of selected tablets||||||M.

Additionally, experimental formulations of both drugs were made by wet granulation method using 10% w/w yam starch paste as binder and yam starch powder as extra- or intragranular disintegrant. Yam starch granules were also employed as direct compression carrier for diazepam tablets. All tablets were examined for friability, hardness, disintegration time and dissolution rate and correlation between them determined.Considerable differences in physical properties, especially disintegration . and dissolution rates, were observed among different brands of both tablets. Experimental tablets containing intra-granular disintegrant had the better mechanical properties and dissolved faster than those containing extra-granular disintegrant with diazepam but not chloroquine formulations whose extra-granular disintegrant tablets were faster dissolving. Direct compression diazepam tablets were not, however, satisfactory.There was a very high statistically significant correlation between hardness and friability of both chloroquine and diazepam tablets. On the other hand, only correlations between hardness, disintegration and dissolution rates of chloroquine were found to be significant and were higher than the corresponding ones for diazepam tablets.|Theses collection|Chloroquine and diazepam tablets/Physical characteristics of compressed tablets*||||||Jagunna, Abiodun Olu|Male|A design proposal for Badagry Beach Holiday Resort, Badagry Town, Lagos State.||||||1984|S.

Evidence has shown that the tourist industry is graduallydeveloping in Nigeria. and that the demand for local tourism facilities is growing at an encouraging rate. However, the provision of recreation facilities for our ever increasing population is yet to be given the proper attention it deserves.The thesis started with the importance of leisure and recreation to the mental, physical and emotional development of mankind and the interrelationship of tourism and recreation. Tourist activities in Nigeria vis-a-vis the recreational facilities provided were examined with a view to establishing an appropriate standardization of typologies for the use and comfort of the tourists. Existing facilities on site and its relationship to the land-use pattern of the town were factors considered in the choiceof site, the overall planning proposals and design parameters.

In this regard, its impact has been felt in both economical and industrial as well as other facet of human development.This thesis started with a literature review of modern techniques in the fields of Aerial Surveys as being practised and used in the developing countries of Africa in general-and Nigerian in Particular, to establish deficiencies. It goes further to review the importence of Aerialel Surveys for a well  co-ordinated national plan (Natural resources, Planning, management etc.) for a countries like Nigeria.In essence, to provide effectively for this function, in terms of its Architecture and Technology,	well documented case studies were carried out. This was to enable the thesis to establish deficiencies in the ones currently in use,to evaluate	existing facilities and their spaces andfinally, to collect	relevant information on aerial surveys technology. In this way, it was possible to programme inboth qualitative and quantitative terms, the size of space and structure; storage capacity (Laboratory and Workshops) and handling potentials of the necessary and useable equipments.In order to put forward a design proposal, a study of locational value and Regional evaluation as well as micro climate of the site for the Architecture of the aerial surveys centre was carried out. In conclusion, the research findings would enable a concept to be proposed by integrating man, machine and building designed, to provide condusive atmosphere for a good learning process.

The data were collected from the response of these teachers to a Leadership Perception Questionnaire, a Teachers' Task Performance Questionnaire, and a Teachers' Background Information Questionnaire. Six hypotheses were formulated to investigate the problem. The chi-square analysis was used to determine the significance of the relationships.The teachers perceived their principals' leadership styles as transactional, (43.19%, 21 principals), democratic, (30.68%, 6 principals), autocratic, (13.50%, 3 principals), pseudo-democratic, (9.79%, 1 principal), and laissez-faire, (2.12%, 1 principal).Teachers' job performances were classified into positive, negative, and neutral types. Teachers classified as positive, perceived their principals as mainlytransactional and democratic. Teachers classified as neutral, perceived their principals as autocratic, pseudo-democratic and laissez-faire.The study found out that principals' leadership styles were significantly related to teachers' job performance, (X2 = 71.35, DF = 4, P>.20). Teachers' qualification, (x2 = 3.58, DF = 4, P<.20), teachers' sex, (X2 = 6.89, DF = 4, P<.20), teachers' experience, (x2 = 8.24, DF = 4, P<.20) , and the location of schools (X2 = 6.21, DF = 4, F<.20), were found to be of no influence on their perception of principals' leadership styles.Since transactional and democratic leadership styles of the principals provided the appropriate social climate for positive job performance, these leadership styles are recommended to the principals of Nigerian Schools.|Theses collection|Principals' leadership / Teachers' job performance*||||||Ibikunle, Ayobami Sore|Male|Studies on gentamicin-induced tissue damage in the rat: possible protection by selenium||||||M.

Lysosomal acid phosphatase and muramidase released from gentamicintreated lysosomal suspensions was significantly higher than the controls. In the presence of selenium, light absorbance decrease and the release of lysosomal enzymes were considerably minimized.In the rats treated with gentamicin alone, there was a significant loss of kidney acid and alkaline phosphatase and muramidase activities, while the activities of these enzymes were markedly elevated in the serum.

(a)	Excessive traffic level and intensity(b)	Poor compaction quality	control(c)	Inadequate structural thickness and(d)	Inadequate provision of drainageThese causes of failure are arranged in order of relative importance and emphasis as usually placed on them in current road design practice in Nigeria (FMWH 1974). These design factors could cause failure separately or in combination with one another.It is observed that most of the factors causing highway failures are identified after post - failure studies are done at such points on the highways where the failures must have occurred. This present research work concentrates on studying proposed road alignment during the planning stage i. e. before actual construction work starts.The present work emphasises the need for engineers to view engineering geology (especially soil mechanics) in the simple terms which lie at the heart of this branch of technology.A proposed road alignment in a virgin forest (Ijebu - Igbo - Alaguntan Road) has been chosen as a change from the previous practice of carrying out investigations on known failure points on roads and highways.

Through a series of surveys like the home interview and bus-passenger surveys, carried out on field, the tools for appraising the transportation system of the University were obtained.The findings obtained after analysis showed that some subsystems of the transportation system were defective. These	include the spatial distribution of parking bays in the central area of the University, the inefficiency of the public transportation system, the over-utilization of certain routes because of the poor conditions of alternative routes, and the high rate of traffic accidents along over-utilized routes and in the central area.A factor-analysis technique was used to forecast future travel trends. It was observed that travel was likely to increase with higher employment rates, house-hold and personal incomes, vehicle ownership, and population density; and will decrease with an increase in a household's distance from the central area of the University.Since a Master Plan for the University was already under implementation, a few recommendation were made to serve as interim measures aimed at solving the inherent transportation problems. These recommendations include the provision of parking bays in deficient areas, the provision of more bus services and facilities to over-come demand and extend its service area, and the renovation of poor conditioned routes that could serve as complementary travel routes to over-utilized ones.|Theses collection |Transportation system / University of  Ife*||||||Adegbola Anthony Afolabi|Male|The effect of nitrogen fertilization on the carbohydrate content, forage quality and regrowth potential of coastal bermudagrass (cynodon dactylon, (l) pers.)||||||PhD.

The first study concerned the effects of top dressing nitrogen at three rates (0, 100, and 250 lb. per acre applied at six-week intervals) on the carbohydrate content of leaves, stems and stolons, roots and rhizomes of coastal Bermudagrass. Plant tissues were analysed for reducing (glucose and fructose}, non-reducing (sucrose) sugars, and for fructosans every two weeks during 1963.The reducing sugar content of leaves increased with increasing rates of fertilization. In stems and stolons as well as in roots and rhizomes no significant changes occurred in reducing sugar content throughout the growth-season. In the leaves there were no significant differences in content of sucrose and fructosan due to fertilizer application but in stems and stolons as well as in rhizomes and roots, sucrose and fructosan content decreased with increasing fertilization.Bermudagrass fertilized at the high rate apparently retains most of the newly synthesized carbohydrate as reducing sugar in-the leaves. The amount of carbohydrate translocated into rhizomes at the high nitrogen level is a small fraction of the total amount synthesized. During the active growth phase, sucrose may be equally as important a source of reserve for regrowth as fructosan.The second phase of the project concerned the evaluation of regrowth potential of the plots fertilized during the first study. Six-inch diameter sod plugs were taken from each plot, put in cans, and grown in a dark chamber. The regrowth potential was measured in mg of dry matter produced per sod plug.The first six-week regrowth was closely related to the content of carbohydrate reserve present in the stubble and rhizome. Sod plugs from plots fertilized at 500 lb. N per acre made the best regrowth. The least regrowth was made by sod plugs from plots fertilized at 750 and 1000 lb. N per acre.The final phase of work involved an evaluation of forage quality of coastal Bermudagrass hays from plots fertilized at 0, 100, and 250 lb. N per acre every six weeks. Rabbits were used as test animals. The grass hays replaced the 40% alfalfa hay normally incorporated into the control ration. Three feeding experiments were carried out using three successive hay harvests. Feed evaluations were based on the live weight gains of young rabbit from age 21 days to 52 days. In the third experiment 8-week-old rabbits were used and the grass feeds were supplemented with preformed vitamin A.In the first two feeding experiments, alfalfa ration was superior to the three coastal Bermudagrass rations, possibly due to the former's higher content of carotene and low level of nitrate. The rabbits fed Bermudagrass rations showed acute symptoms of vitamin A deficiency, masking any observable differences between the coastal Bermudagrass feeds. In the third experiment, rabbits on fertilized Bermudagrass rations performed very poorly. These rations contained levels of nitrate-nitrogen that are possibly toxic to rabbits, and which might interfere with availability and utilization of vitamin A.|Theses collection|Nitrogen fertilization / Carbohydrate content, forage quality and regrowth potential of coastal bermudagrass (cynodon dactylon, (l) pers.)*||||||Eze, Josiah Onyinye|Male|Limited chymotryptic cleavage of archachatina (calachatina) marginata haemocyanin||||||M.

The first study concerned the effects of top dressing nitrogen at three rates (0, 100, and250 lb. per acre applied at six-week intervals) on the carbohydrate content of leaves, stems and stolons, roots and rhizomes of coastal Bermudagrass. Plant tissues were analysed for reducing (glucose and fructose), non-reducing (sucrose) sugars, and for fructosans every two weeks during 1963.The-reducing sugar content of leaves increased with increasing rates of fertilization. In stems and stolons as well as in roots and rhizomes no significant changes occurred in reducing sugar content throughout the growth 'Season. In the leaves there were no significant differences in content of sucrose and fructosan due to fertilizer application but in stems and stolons as well as in rhizomes and roots, sucrose and fructosan content decreased with increasing fertilization.Bermudagrass fertilized at the high rate apparently retains most of the newly synthesized carbohydrate as reducing sugar in'the leaves. The amount of carbohydrate translocated into rhizomes at the-high-nitrogen level is a small fraction of the total amount synthesized. During theactive growth phase, sucrose may be equally as important a source of reserve for regrowth as fructosan.The second phase of the project concerned the evaluation of regrowth potential of the plots fertilized during the first study. Six-inch diameter sod plugs were taken from each plot, put in cans, and grown in a dark chamber. The regrowth potential was measured in mg of dry matter produced per sod plug.The first six-week regrowth was closely related to the content of carbohydrate reserve present in the stubble and rhizome. Sod plugs from plots fertilized at 500 lb. N per acre made the best regrowth. The least regrowth was made by sod plugs from plots fertilized at 750 and 1000 lb. N per acre.The final phase of work involved an evaluation of forage quality of coastal Bermudagrass hays from plots fertilized at 0, 100, and 250 lb. N per acre every six weeks. Rabbits were used as test animals. The grass hays replaced the 40%. alfalfa hay normally incorporated into the control ration. Three feeding experiments were carried out using three successive hay harvests. Feed evaluations were based on the live weight gains of young rabbit from age 21 days to 52 days. In the third experiment 8-week-old rabbits were used and the grass feeds were supplemented with preformed rased vitamin A.In the first two feeding experiments, alfalfa ration was superior to the three coastal Bermudagrass rations, possibly due to the former's higher content of carotene and low level of nitrate. The rabbits fed Bermudagrass rations showed acute symptoms of vitamin A deficiency, masking any observable differences between the coastal Bermudagrass  feeds. La the third experiment, rabbits on fertilized Bermudagrass rations performed very poorly. These rations contained levels of nitrate-nitrogenthat are possibly toxic to rabbits, and which might interfere with availability and utilization of vitamin A.|Theses collection|Nitrogen Fertilization / Forage Quality and Regrowth Potential of CoastalBermudagrass / (Cynodon Dactylon (L) Pers.)*||||||Mbufong, Paul Kuban|Male|A linguistic study of the language of law||||||M.

Although some studies have been done on the language of law, this work differs from existing studies not only in terms of the greater detail it covers but more in terms of the method of approach: it combines the two indispensable components of style investigation: analysis and comparison in the treatment of a particular register of the English Language - the language of law.In doing this, a specification of the general context of language variation within which this study falls is undertaken. A random selection of sufficiently broad-based samples of written legal texts follows. Analysis and comparison of these texts at the linguistic levels of syntax, lexis and graphology is embarked upon with a view to determining their indexical markers and common-core features. From the analyses and comparison of data, it is observed that while the language of law as a specialized code displayscertain characteristics riot exclusive to the profession but prevalent enough to have formed a fixed association, differences even emerge which can safely be said to be text-specific.

Some selected personal and socio-economic characteristics of parents and their youths, level of role performance by parents in the development of their youths, the development indicators of youths as perceived by the parents and level of development of the rural youths were examined. It also identified the constraints faced by parents in performing their roles towards enhancing positive developmental outcomes in their youths.Pre-tested and structured interview schedules were used to elicit information from one hundred and eighty-six parents and their youths aged between 11 and 18. They were selected using multi-stage random sampling techniques. Qualitative data were gathered through focus group discussions, which revealed the communities' understanding of parental role performance and youth development. Descriptive (frequencies counts and percentages) and inferential statistical analyses such as linear correlation, regression and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were employed.The result showed that 42.47 percent of the parents fell within the age group of 56-65 years and were married and living together with their spouses. About 58.60 percent were illiterates and had between 7 and 11 people in their household comprising of between 1 and 2 youths. Also, 66.13 percent were Christians; earned low incomes; had spent more than twenty one years residing in the community; and belonged to rural community associations including Parents' Teachers' Association (P.T.A). Also, between 64.52 and 100percent of the parents perceived and performed their roles in developing the rural youths. However, there was a high level of performance of roles such as enforcement of discipline, giving guidance, absence of coercive control, provision of good and adequate nutrition. At 0.05 level of significance, correlation analysis showed positive and significant relationship between level of development of rural youths and parent's educational level (r = 0.2026), and cosmopoliteness (r = 0.1664). Significant associations existed between level of development of rural youths and parent's sex (X2 = 14.697 C = 0.2706), maritalstatus (X,2= 13.169; C = 0.2571) and religion (X2 = 16.749; C = 0.23 7 4).

It was further revealed that there is a highly significant relationship between the level of role performance by parents and level of development of rural youths (X2 = 13.618; C = 0.2612). Also the analysis of variance result (F = 1.441) shows that there was no significant difference between role perception and role performance by parents in developing their rural youths.The parents, therefore, perceived their roles as worthy of performance and equally performed these roles towards positive developmental outcomes in their youths.|Theses collection|Parents / Youths*||||||Nwosuh, Amaka|Male|Effect of tragacanth and tweens on the hydrolysis of aspirin in aqueous medium||||||M.

An increase in the stability of the aqueous aspirin suspension was observed with increase in the alkyl chain length of the polysorbates. The least degradation was obtained in the presence of 5%w/v polysorbate 80.The effect of compound tragacanth powder and tragacanth mucilage on the stability of aqueous aspirin suspension was also separately determined. O.5%w/v of compound tragacanth powder gave the best stabilizing effect. On the contrary, tragacanth mucilage enhanced the degradation of the aspirin and was therefore considered unsuitable for use in stabilizing aspirin suspension. Employing 5%w/v polysorbate 80 and 0.5%w/v compound tragacanth powder, it was found that the use of aspirin powder of mesh size 60, instead of the higher mesh sizes, further enhanced the stability of the aspirin suspension.The optimal conditions of 5%W/v polysorbate 80, 0.5%W/v compound tragacanth powder and aspirin powder of mesh size 60 were employed in the formulation of aqueous aspirin suspension. The rate of hydrolysis of the latter product was monitored as a function of temperature. Aqueous aspirin suspension without surfactant and tragacanth was used as control. The result showed increased degradation of aspirin with increase in temperature.An incorporation of a flavouring agent, a colourant and a preservative in the suspension had no significant influence on the rate of aspirin degradation.Finally, an estimated shelf-life of the aspirin suspension was made based on elevated temperaturestudy. The aspirin suspension was found to have a shelf-life of about 30 days at 4C, 10 days at 25C under stabilized conditions and about one day at 25C in the absence of stabililizing conditions.|Theses collection|Tragacanth / Tweens / Aspirin*||||||Muse, Wasiu Adesola Alade|Male|Studies in proteolytic activity in the midgut homogenate of the blowfly, CHRYSOMYIA CHLOROPYGA  (WIED)  (DIPTERA : CALLIPHORIDAE||||||M.

This attracted African and world attention to the territory and strengthened the efforts of the freedom fighters in their demand for majority African rule. The strategies which the Zimbabwean nationalists adopted included actual military struggle and appeal to other African states and the rest of the international community for assistance.Nigeria and other African countries responded to this appeal. However, the degree and extent of Nigeria's contribution varied from one regime to another. While the response of the Balewa regime was conservative, and while Gowon was toopreoccupied with the civil war and the internal problems of postwar reconstruction, the Murtala/Obasanjo regime adopted a more vigorous and radical policy to the independence of Zimbabwe.This study examines Nigeria's contribution to Zimbabwe's independence, taking into account the attitude and dynamism of each Nigerian regime, the response of the international community, and the relentless efforts of Zimbabwean freedom fighters all of which led to the territory's independence on 17 April 1980.|Theses collection|Zimbabwe*||||||Oguntonade, Edward Oluwadare|Male|Factors affecting the use of media in selected secondary schools in Ondo state of Nigeria||||||M.

An examination of the performance of the Local Government institutions in South-Western Nigeria, between 1960 and 1980 revealed a skewed orientation of activities and expenditure patterns of councils in favour of services which reinforce an urbanised approach to the problems of the rural areas, a relative rural neglect and a peculiar buck-passing.By em cloying a system model for analysing the rural economy of South-Western Nigeria, it was evident that there is a compelling "urban bias" in the activities. Also, the patterns of rural-urban relation suggest a peculiarity which questions any uniform pattern of local government activities. In the bid to explain these observable features and relative governmental rural ineffectiveness, even among rural councils, it was evident that the predominance of urban ways of life is relatively constraining to rural development. This urban-outlook had however been reinformed by various inter-governmental issues and a seeming buck-passing characteristic of federal systems of government. These various factors have set major limits on the sizes, contents, directions and the relevance of council activities, given the identified problems of the rural areas.While the study argues that Local Governments have performed significant roles in the rural areas in the provision of certain social services and road infrastructure, it is also noted that council-provided-services were the only visible indications of government presence in most localities. But at the same time, most councils were found to be less active in pursuing policies and programmes that are both truly 'local' and relatively - specific to most rural areas.This study calls attention to the various issues and problems facing Local Governments. It argues that the potential for more council effectiveness and efficiency is present in South-Western Nigeria. It also suggests that more Local Government involvement in rural development activities particularly in the salient areas of rural economic activities especially in agriculture will go a long way to creating the needed mechanisms for smooth rural development intermediation.|Theses collection|Local Government Institution / Rural Development*||||||Adesulu,|Male||||||||||Ile-Ife||1984|||OAU||||||||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The organization hierarchy and the departmentation method adopted in the company were analysed.  The analysis has revealed a centralized authority relationship, lack of delegation, and inadequate coordination and control.  From the analysis it is clear that NIROWI has adopted inappropriate management structure.  A review of operation between the period 1978 and 1980 has shown that the company has been making losses.  Production and sales targets have not been achieved.  Production capacities have been under-utilised resulting in annual losses.  Organisational problems in the company were, also highlighted.

The seismic refraction results show that the area is underlain by a medium to high quality foundation material (Vp = 2500 m/s), The region with velocity higher than 2500 m/s has an unconfined compressive strength higher than 8.5 x 106 kg/m2 indicating a fairly good foundation rock correlating with fresh sandstone rock.The coefficient of permeability of the sandstone rock varies from 3.10 x 10-6 m/s to  7.95 x 10-6 m/s. Cone penetration tests show that the sandstone is very dense. It is thus evident that the sandstone rock is fairly sound and would carry a small/medium size dam. Nevertheless the site could be regarded as problematic.|Theses collection|Dam / sandstone rock*||||||Adedokun Timothy Adeyemi|Male|The Hydrogeology of the Okitipupa tar sand area||||||M. Sc.

Both surface and ground water systems were investigated in an area covering approximately one hundred square kilometers.Evidence obtained from the forty boreholes drilled for tar sand reserve evaluation and the six boreholes drilled for the hydrogeologic investigations, showed the presence of perChed and artesian aquifers in the area. Permeability is invariably low in the tar horizons while the tranamissivity and permeability values are high in the artesian aquifers. Dater wells drilled into the southern portion of the artesian formation revealed discharge rates in the range of 71,000 to 109,000 litres per hour. Transmissibility and permeability values were estimated to be 7.3 x 10-I m2/s and 2.43 x 10-2 m/srespectively in the artesian aquifers.The average depth to the artesian aquifers is estimated at about 60 metres while the depth to the tar and sand horizons range from 0 to 50 metres. The removal of thisoverburden therefore poses the danger of heaving and blowup due to artesian pressures. The planning and construction of pressure relief wells and adequate drainage and dewatering systems are therefore suggested as a necessary prerequisite for the successful winning of the economically viable tar horizons.Chemical analysis of water samples show that the springs, streams and dug well water are soft and fresh while the artesian waters are moderately hard. and highly saline.|Theses collection|Mining operations of the tar sand horizons/Surface and ground water systems/Hydrogeological characteristics of the okitipupa Tar Sand area*||||||Afolabi Betty Adeola|Female|The Reaction of Sixth Form Adolescents to Moral Norms in Oyo State, Nigeria||||||M.

The focus was on sixth form adolescents from eleven institutions that offer the Higher School Certificate course in Oyo State, Nigeria. Some of the variables considered and included in the questionnaire filled by the subjects were family back-ground, frequency of parental moral education, sex, academic achievement and the effect of the school setting on the adolescents,A sample of 392 subjects made up of 225 boys and 167 girls was selected for. the purpose of the study. Altogether, five hypotheses were considered and tested. In analysing the data collected from the questionnaire administered to the subjects, the Pearson product moment correlation co-efficient was employed in assessing the degree of relationship between family background and reaction to moral norms and conformity to moral norms and academic achievement. The t-test was employed in determining the significance of differences between the reaction of male and female adolescents. to moral norms, the reaction of adolescents who are frequently educated by their parents on moral norms. and those who are not and the reactionof 'regimented' and 'non-regimented' adolescent student of Oyo State to moral norms.Some of the results of the study revealed that:-	Adolescents from high social status in terms of education and occupation were greatly influenced by their family background in their reaction to moral norms.-	There was no significant difference between the reaction of male and female adolescents to moral norms.Some of the recommendations were that:-	curriculum planners should include the teachingof moral norms in the school curriculum.-	all parents should be teachers of moral normswhich should be tailored towards bringing outthe best out of their children.|Theses collection|Adolescents behaviour/ Adolescents  moral norms/Sixth form adolescents*||||||Toriola Abel Lamina|Male|Influence of distance running on coronary risk factors in male undergraduates||||||M.

A total of 40 untrained subjects participated in the study. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of four study groups: (i) Control, (ii) Experimental (1.6 kilometer joggers), (iii) Experimental (3.2 kilometer joggers), (iv) Experimental (4.8 kilometer joggers). There were ten subjects in each study group. The training groups were made to jog the prescribed distances at about 85 percent HRmax, three times a week for 12 weeks.Subjects anthropometric and biochemical measurements were taken through standardized procedures before and after the training programme. A one-way ANOVA was computed on the difference scores which were obtained by subtracting the post from the pre-training scores, for each subject and for each dependent variable. Newman-Keul's post hoc analyses were computed where F-ratio was significant (I< 0.05).The following results were obtained:(i) The exercise groups did not differ significantly from one another with respect to levels of reduction in percent body fat. Percent body fat reduced significantly (P< 0.05) in the exercise groups as compared to the control group.(ii)	In subjects of the 4.8 kilometer group blood glucose level declined significantly (P& 0.05) as compared to those of other groups.(iii)	Subjects in the 3.2 kilometer group had significantly (P< 0.05) lowered level of serum triglyceride than subjects in the other training groups.(iv)	Subjects within the experimental groups generally had greater but insignificant decline in blood pressure, serum cholesterol and serum uric acid levels as compared to the control subjects.It was concluded that jogging over 4.8 kilometers three times a week, for 12 weeks was generally most effective in lowering the levels of coronary risk factors in the group of male undergraduates. It was recommended that the duration of training programmes should be long enough to enable the occurence of adequate physiological effects, especially when subjects are untrained.|Theses collection|Distance running / coronary risk factors/ blood pressure/ percent body fat/ blood glucose/ serum cholesterol/ serum triglyceride and serum uric acid*||||||Esenwa, Gabriel Ogochukwu|Male|Some aspects of pharmacokinetics of niridazone in bilharzia patients.||||||M.

This study is divided into six chapters. Chapter one discusses the concepts of adult education generally byreviewing existing definitions and assumptions.  Chapter two examines the various aspects of the informal and formal patterns and the content of the indigenous Yoruba adult education which embraced community consciousness, common values and skills needed for the survival of the society as well as individual vocational enterprises. The third chapter analyses the historical and religious aspects of the establishment and provision of western-style adult education by the Missionaries, traders and government officials as agencies between 1842 and 1882. The religious, commercial and political activities of these agencies provided the basis for the comparative study. The fourth chapter contains an examination of the establishment of Industrial Education. During the 1880's, the Missionaries attempted to modernise the indigenous crafts and vocational training of the Yoruba converts through the apprenticeship system. They adopted for most of their educational programmes the trial-and-error method. In varying degrees of successes and failures, the industrial education programme helped totrain a few Yoruba workers in different occupations like carpentry, masonry, brick making and even farming. Chapter five highlights. the auspicious application of western-style adult education to the agro-economic and social welfare of the Yoruba people. This was brought about by the generalpolitical awareness among the educated Yoruba people which, from 1893 to 1945, led to schism in the C.M.S. The newly established African Churches in the interior of Yorubaland promoted western-style adult education, while chapter six summarises the study and relates the findings and conclusions to the melting point between the indigenous and the western-style adult education systems in Yorubaland.|Theses collection|Yoruba indigenous adult education systems /  western-style adult education systems / Adult education *||||||Adegbulu, Adetoye|Male|RELATIONS BETWEEN NIGERIA AND ANGOLA, 1975 - 1978||||||M.

The state of relations between Nigeria and Angola from 1960 to 1974 constituted the main focus of Chapter One. Under the Balewa government, 1960-1966, Nigeria's relations with the African movements was rather hostile. The African policy of Balewa was against indiscriminate aid to the liberation movements because it was felt that the termination of colonial rule could lead to disruptions after independence. The Ironsi and Gowon regimes took certain measures to support the Angolan nationalist movements because of the aid Portugal and South Africa gaveto the Biafrans during the Nigerian civil war. The second chapter outlines the historical setting of Angola, the emergence of the nationalist movements, the political stalemate on the eve of independence, the- civil war, and then goes on to explain Nigeria's initial and ultimate response to the Angolan civil war. The comparison of national interest in foreign policies of Nigeria and Angola are dealt with in chapter three. Here an attempt is made to bring into focus the attitudes of the two countries to such issues as African unity, liberation struggle, border clashes and non-alignment. The fourth chapter examines the areas in which Nigeria and. Angola could co-operate and issues which may lead to conflict between the two countries. The study concludes with the premise that relations between the two countries may develop toward a more cordial nature if the government that emerges in Nigeria in 1979 is attuned to the policies of the present government.|Theses collection|Nigeria and Angola Relations from 1975 to 1978 *||||||Okafor, Linus Mgbodima|Male|KNOWLEDGE OF CONTENT AND METHODS OF TEACHING SOCIAL STUDIES BY GRADUATING GRADE TWO COLLEGE STUDENTS IN ONDO STATE||||||M.

Grade two teachers in Ondo State were prepared in one-year, two-year and three-year course tiers. The purpose of the study was to ascertain the performance levels of the graduating students in each of the three tiers in the grade two certificate social studies examination and to ascertain the teaching methods which teacher-trainers used in teaching grade two college social studies.The study population was made up of 240 graduating students and their eleven teachers, selected from six teachers grade two colleges in Ondo State. The instruments used in gathering data were teachers grade two certificate examination results in social studies; questionnaire for social studies teachers; questionnaire for the graduating students; and an observation guide used by the researcher to ascertain on the spot the teaching methods teachers normally used for their lessons.The findings showed that a majority of the graduating students had just an average knowledge of grade two socialstudies; students who did two-year grade two course had a slightly higher knowledge of the subject than students in each of the other two course tiers; college teachers made more use of traditional teaching methods (such as the lecture method) than the new teaching methods that require increased learner participation; and a majority of the social studies teachers did not receive any special training in the teaching of the subject.The researcher, therefore; recommends that: social studies teachers should make increasing use of the inquiry method; only qualified teachers should be engaged to teach social studies; and seminars on the subject should be organised regularly. Further research is suggested to assess the ability of grade two college graduates in teaching primary school social studies.|Theses collection|knowledge of social studies / Grade two teachers  *||||||Adegbesan, Tunde|Male|The weatherability of coal-bearing argillite near Lafia||||||M.

Petrographic studies included thin section study, ignition loss, chemical analysis and x - ray Diffraction. Chemical analysis showed that the samples are hydrous aluminosilicates with appreciable iron titanium and magnesium content. Results from x - ray Diffraction indicated the presence of three groups of minerals, quartz, iron - and clay minerals. The iron minerals are goethite and chamosite while the clay minerals are chlorite, chloriteripidolite and chlorite - montmorillonite.The samples possess an average bulk density of 2.61gm/cc, exhibited medium porosity (10%) .and. specific ,gravity. (2.77). laboratory weathering tests carried out are free swell, water absorption, slake durability and crystallization test. These tests provide a simple, rapid but reliable evaluation of the weatherability and durability of the argillites. The results show a low free swell, average11% and a relative high potential to water absorption, (49%).The samples crumbled easily and are unsound.Possible problems such as swelling ground, squeezing ground and running ground associated with underground construction in generally incompetent rocks were identified. These can be prevented by treatment of materials with chemicals or by allowing the rocks to move under controlled conditions with installation of strain guages.Thus even with these unfavourable engineering properties, the construction of underground structures for winning the coal in the argillites, is still a justifiable engineering feat.|Theses collection|weatherability  / Coal-bearing argillite*||||||Sofekun, Morounfayo Oluwatoyin|Female|An investigation of the ability of environmental bacteria to proliferate in selected intravenous fluids.||||||M.

A close study and analysis of the Policy-making and implementation of the scheme is considered a worthwhile exercise so as to add to the literature that could guide in the formulation and execution of other national efforts.An attempt has been made to trace the genesis of the idea of free education in the whole world in general and in Nigeria in particular. This is followed by an examination of the preparatory planning process, and the policy-making process on the scheme against the background of the Normative Optimum model prescribed by Dror. (1969). Further more, an examination was made of its actual execution by the Bureaucracy, against the background of the Classical School of management as put forward by unwick (1947).From this study, one observes that in the Federal Government's preparation for the U.P.E. Scheme, all the fifteen preparatory steps as enumerated by Dror, for Normative Optimum model, were taken by the Federal Government. The stages were however compliled with in an unco-ordinated 'muddling' fashion charasteristic of Lindblom's Incrementalist approach.This Incrementalist approach was discussed and found unsuitable for the scheme largely because of the time constraint and the novelty of the scheme. The Normative Optimum approach was also found unsuitable becauseof the inadequacy of data, end the unpredictability of our monolithic source of revenue generation. One is therefore compelled to advocate for future schemes, 'the mixed Scanning' approach as enunciated by Amital Etzioni (1963) which combine suitable elements in both the Incrementalist and the Normative optimum models.As far as the actual implementation on the scheme was concerned, it is found that the main constraint is the colonialist oriented bureaucracy. What is therefore recommended is a general re-orientation of the entire Nigerian Bureaucracy towards a more results - oriented Rational Productivity Bureaucracy as advocated by IIchman, {1970), Fredrick Riggs and even by the Udoji Report (1973).|Theses collection|Universal Primary Education*||||||Osundare, Lawrence Akinola|Male|A Design Proposal for the National Orthopaedic Hospital,Lagos, Nigeria||||||M.

Their existing departments, staff standards and the relationship of one department to the other as regard their location were taken into consideration.The third chapter deals with an ideal orthopaedic Hospital. The conditions for each department in order to be an ideal one were found out and alaysed. Each of these departments were treated separately and the units that make up each department where also known.Chapter four deals with the site, the geography of the site, were analysed and the design criteria taken to form the basis forthe proposed National Orthopaedic Hospital. In this chapter, the departments provided for were discussed as regard their planning and their locations.Chapter five which is the least chapter deals with the accommodation schedule of the spaces provided for in chapter four. The pattern of circulation and the services within the complex were discussed. Such services include ventilation, gass supply, Electrical Installation,Lighting, and accoustics Materials and finishes for the building were also discussed according to the functions they perform.All these chapter make the thesis a "whole".|Theses collection|Orthopaedic Hospital*||||||Adelusi Adekunle Ajayi|Male|Heat-induced quantitative changes in the growth, photosynthetic apparatus, plastidPigments and flavonoids of Zea mays linn.

When the seedlings were heat-stressed at 45C for 16 hours, however, there was a decrease in all of the parameters measured, the rate of decrease being more pronounced with the longer duration of stress in the case of chloroplast formation, leaf length and seedling height. The cowpea seedlings were more sensitive to heat stress than the maize seedlings.When etiolated seedlings of maize were heat-stressed at 45C for 16 hours and then illuminated at 25C, there was a retardation in the rate of accumulation of carotenes and protochlorophyllide, whilethat of xanthophylls, flavones and phytol was enhanced. The accumulation of phytol, however, was reterded in dark-grown seedlings.

No minute would strike without the populace i.e. the supposed beneficiaries of the service-delivery groaning and moaning over lack of performance of these Corporations. Some of them have gained so much notoriety that their abbreviations are being punned e.g. National Electricity Power Authority (NEPA) becoming "Never Expect Power Again".One becomes really intrigued that the Public Corporations are set up to facilitate development, usher change (economic, social and political) and develop the manpower potentialities available in the country, among other reasons. As the populace complain, so are the various governments,Federal and States, the financiers and sponsors of these Public Corporations. In fact, the various government approaches to bailing out the Public Corporations from their non-performance range from institution of judicial probes into theirmanagement to handling them to foreign Management Consultants.

Their usefulness in coding for secured message transmission vis-a-vis their use in cryptography oriented systems have been critically looked into.A specialised alpha-numeric keyboard encoder which can be operated at frequencies between (3-4,000) kHz has been designed and constructed. Each alpha-numeric character forms the input to a 8x8 matrix whose columns are the inputs of a multiplexer and rows the outputs of a decoder. The keyboard incorporates a printed circuit technique to connect the switches for improved reliability. In the design each character is encoded by six binary bits.

Some of the factors examined were related to learner himself, the subject matter and the contents of the mathematics syllabus used in schools, attitudes and methods of teaching of the teachers, the use and making of teaching aids during mathematics lessons, and other factors such as the school and the class time-table, the library facilities and the classroom arrangement.The study sample consisted of students from a co-educational school in an urban area, students from a co-educational school in a rural town, students from one girls' school and one boys' school both in an urban town. By this choice of schools, there was the opportunity of comparing attitudes towards mathematics of students in the ruralareas with those in urban centres, students in co-educational schools with their counterparts in uni-educational schools, boys and girls in the same institution, and lastly, students in boys' schools with those in girls' schools.The methods of investigation included the administration of a questionnaire to two hundred students in Form III of four secondary schools and oral interviews with the Class III mathematics teachers in the four schools. Personal observations of some facilities related to attitude formation towards mathematics were also made. The results were analysed and tabulated in Chapter Four.In the concluding chapter, a list of suggestions, based on the results of the investigations and which can help in creating greater positive attitudes of students, especially Form III students, towards mathematics was made.These include: (1) individualising instruction in mathematics; (2) designing two curricula for secondary schools in mathematics, one for the social needs of the learner and the other for those who will pursue mathematics and mathematical subjects in higher institutions; (3) allowing vary experienced teachers to teach Form III; (4) using teaching aids, library facilities and textbooks profitably;(5)	providing mathematics laboratories in schools, and(6)	giving homeworks, assignments and projects to students, especially those in urban centres, so as to keep them involved in mathematics after the school hours.|Theses collection|Attitudes and methods of teaching of the teachers / Form III students' attitudes towards mathematics / mathematics lessons*||||||Akindehin, Olufolamiji|Male|Predicting academic performance from entry qualifications at Adeyemi College of Education, Ondo||||||M.

The main hypothesis of the study was that: There is no significant relationship between the entry qualifications and academic performance of Adeyemi College students.The students' entry qualifications considered are age, sex, teaching experience, entrance examination score, qualifying entry certificate which could bei West African School Certificate or General Certificate of Education Ordinary Level (WASC), ii Teachers' Grade Two Certificate (TCII) oriii Pivotal (combination of i and ii)and level of performance in WASC/TCII.A total of 1006 students were sampled for the sturdy from the students of ACE who were in their first and third years in the 1980/81 academic session. The study made use of stepwise multiple regression analysis, repeated measures analysis of variance and one way analysis of variance.The results show among others that different combinations of students' entry qualifications can be used to predictstudents marks in each semester at ACE. And also, there was no significant difference in the academic performance of WASC, TCII and Pivotal holders.It is included among the recommendations that the selection of students into the NCE programme should not be determined solely by entrance examination score. Other student background qualities such as age, teaching experience and sex could also be considered. Furthermore TCII cannot be deemed as inferior academically to WASC for purposes of selection of candidatesinto institutions of higher learning, particularly those for Teacher Education.|Theses collection|Entry qualifications / Academic performance*||||||Adesina, M.

Thereafter, attention is directed towards planning and planning strategies. The planning experience in the former western State during 1975-80 development plan and the Oyo State programme of the 4th National Development Plan (1981-85) is treated and constrasted and, basically, the goals of the two plans are considered identical. Premium is placed, however, on the "four cardinal programmes" of the Government in Oyo State programmes of the 4th National Development Plan 1981-85. These are free education at all levels, free medical services, integrated rural development and full employment.Arrangement for the provision of funds and the state apparatus for the sane is this subject of Chapter IV wherein the revenue sources, types of Government expenditure and its control are discussed. Significantly relevant in this regard is Budgeting under which three types of budgeting are mentioned and briefly treated. More importantly, the budget process in Oyo State is marshalled and the unique role of the ad-hoc body, "Fund Allocation Committee" in channelling available resources to priority areas is explained, all in Chapters V and VI.The inter-relationship of planning and budgeting and its assessment as a vehicle for plan implementation is the focal point of Chapter Vll.

As the country's official language, the language of formal education, of politics, of commerce, and of inter-ethnic and international communication, English has become a language required for full participation in Nigerian affairs. This is the reason for the investigator's concern about students' poor performance in English every year on the West African School Certificate Examination (WASCE).Several possible causes were examined, but the paucity of qualified teachers of English and absence of good English language textbooks were considered to be the most threatening. Since teacher training normally requires a long time to accomplish, it was resolved that textbooks should provide the immediate remedy by presenting instructional materials in such quantity and of such quality as will ensure students' general competence in English language and success in the WASCE.Consequently, there were two parts to the study. The first part examined the types and amount of composition tasks set in each of the three coursebooks which subdivide into fifteen textbooks. The composition tasks in the fifteen textbooks and WASCE English composition papers from 1969-1979 were compiled by the investigator and handed out to apanel of three independent raters. The raters categorized each composition task according to the working definitions provided by the investigator. Frequency counts were later computed and expressed as percentages for the purpose ofcomparison.It was found that students were more frequently expected to write in the transactional-report category than in any of the six other categories used in the study. The textbooks' failure to include a fair proportion of composition tasks for each category was regarded as a fault since composition tasks were set in all the categories in the WASCE at one time or another.The second part of the study assessed the quality of instruction in each coursebook and the accompanying Teacher's Notes. Two of the three coursebooks were found to be average while the third was rated inferior. It was concluded that a coursebook would be satisfactory in the Nigerian situation examined in the study only if it provided superior quality instruction.|Theses collection|Writing Skills / English Language / Nigerian School Certificate EnglishLanguage Program*||||||Adeleye Michael Odere|Male|Aburi : a case study of peacemaking diplomacy||||||M.

Special attention is paid to the circumstances which necessitated the meeting, the role of the officers of the Federal Military Government as well as those of the Eastern Region, and the strategies employed by each side to achieve its objectives.A critical examination of the peace settlement reveals that Aburi peace meeting was a failure, several reasons accounted for this. In the first place the agreements were unrealistic as many of the provisions could not be implemented without causing a disintegration of some national institutions like the army. Secondly, there were no specific recommendations on the methods of implementation; and there were no sanctions against any breach of the agreements. Finally, the leaders at Aburi underestimated the mood and strength of the secessionist forces in the East and the determination of the Federalists in Lagos to keep Nigeria united.|Theses collection|Aburi / Peacemaking / Nigeria Military Leaders*||||||Shonubi Abiodun Tunde|Male|An evaluation of finished products inventory management as an integral part of marketing planning||||||M.B.A.  Business Administration|John Weinrich||Ile-Ife, Nigeria |Obafemi Awolowo University,  Management and Accounting|1983|||http://library.oauife.edu.ng Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Limited - a glass container manufacturing company. The activities related to stock accumulation and depletion were observed. The accuracy of sales forecasts and reliability of production programmes were investigated. These were evaluated in the context of conventional principles of finished products inventory management, particularly as they relate to marketing planning.The study revealed that the company was faced with an acute problem of managing its stock of finished products, to the extent that it had to rent five additional warehouses at different locations to supplement its on-site storage facilities. This additional cost of renting warehouses was unplanned, and it affected the company's profit. The accumulation of stock resulted from inaccuracy of sales estimates; lack of in-depth understanding of customers (and the market generally); inefficiency of the printing department and some external factors which are beyond the company's control.It was observed that this stock accumulation impaired the company's commercial activities. The study also revealed that these inefficiencies resulted in a poor customer service level,low sales, reduced production efficiency, and poor performance ofthe company as a whole.To overcome these problems, it is recommended that the company's sales forecast be based on a more realistic assessment of customers' needs and likely bottle offtakes rather than merely accepting customers stated requirements. The company should also estimate its customers' stocks of its products. Studier bulk packaging should also be adopted for more effective use of its present warehouse space, and the provision of an additional warehouse on site is imperative.

The concentrations of the soaps employed were 0.0625% (w/v), 0.125% (w/v) and 0.25% (w/v). Potassium myristate exhibited the highest reduction of viability of the test organism, followed by Potassium laurate, Potassium palmitate, and lastly Potassium stearate. Antibacterial activity was observed to increase with increasing concentrations of the soaps.Furthermore, the potassium soaps was observed to cause a significant increase in both the nephelometer readings and the optical density of whole cells of the test organisms.The soaps also caused a leakage of intracellular materials. This suggests that soaps have some effect on the cell membrane of bacteria. The leakage induced by potassium myristate was the greatest, while that induced by the stearate was the least. The ability of the soaps to act on the cell membrane was further demonstrated by the uptake of acriflavine in the presence of soaps. The soaps brought about a disorganization of the cell membrane as shown by the fact that cells were rendered permeable to acriflavine in their presence.|Theses collection|Antibacterial activity / Softs soaps*||||||Adenuga James Olusegun Olaitan|Males|An Appraisal of Equity Share  Ownership in Nigeria, 1958 - 1980||||||M.

However, equity ownership is not in this paper discussed with respect to these institutions, Rather, its focus is on assessing how far equity share-ownership has succeeded in contributing to the independent economic development of Nigeria.It is shown that from the incorporation of the Lagos Stock Exchange in 1960, to the enactment of the Companies Decree in 1968 and the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Decrees of 1972 and 1977 Nigeria has experienced changes in its economy similar to those which had earlier taken place in the political sphere with political independence in 1960. This was a period when radical opinions were rampant and nationalism pervaded third world countries including many countries in Africa. It was an era "when governments were urged to curb the excesses of foreign monopoly capital so that control over the national economy could pass into the hands of the country's own citizens and that in the absence of indigenous entrepreneurs, large and experienced enough to take over, governments should themselves take over. In Uganda, it resulted in the explusion of Asians; in Ghana, Nigerians and in Kenya, Europeans.In Uganda, Ghana and Kenya, attempts to hand over control of the economy to citizens resulted in the alienation of foreign nationals, and loss of needed expertise.The policies pursued by the Nigerian Government can there-fore be seen as gradualist and conciliatory affording Nigerians unlimited opportunities of business ownership, and at the sametime providing avenues for foreign investment in advanced technology.The result was that Nigeria experienced no disruption in implementing its policies. Rather, Nigeria earned international respect and co-operation.The study also shows that it is not the majority equity ownership of commercial enterprises, the majority membership of the Boards of Directors, nor the financial gains that accrue from ownership that determine the ultimate control of enterprise. Rather, the ability to control enterprise requires the chief actors to comprehend a given technology and to have the management expertise and ability to evolve relevant technologies.The major findings of this paper is that the various achievements of the "enterprises" promotion decrees can be viewed as aids towards the realisation of greater long-term objectives, which should include the evolution of indigenous technology, the emergence of indigenous management personnel, and control of the Board of Directors.|Theses collection|Equity share - ownership / stock in trade / capital market*||||||Adebanjo Afolabi|Male|Studies on the anthracnose disease of water yam (dioscorea alata, L.)||||||M.PHIL.,  Plant  Science|P.

The model described applies to incidence of black pod disease in an experimental plot in Ibadan, Nigeria based on the black pod incidence and meteorological factors for the period of March to November 1976.The 3-compartment model, consists of	(1) number of pods available for infection, (2) number of infected pods and (3) number of infected pods above 200cm; where total pod production is a source and number of pods harvested is a sink. The model is conceptualized as a steady-state physical transfer of elements in the plot. The model was driven with rate of infection, which was developed as a linear function of rainfall frequency and proportion of infected pods 200cm above ground surface; after statistical analysis of factors affecting the dispersal and infection processes of inoculum. All input variables were lagged one week. The parameter values for the driving equation were estimated by least squares method, and those of the compartment model were estimated by direct determination from observed data.Computer simulations that could perform computations on weekly time steps were executed on an IBM-360 machine.The simulation results obtained from the model were compared with observed incidence of black pods. In general, the model output compared favourably with observed data.The validation of the model was achieved by applying the model to a different cocoa plot with the same macroclimatic factors over the same period. The simulation output of the model also compared favourably with the observed data.A sensitivity analysis of the model showed that the rate of infection is sensitive to changes in frequency of rainfall and canopy infection; and the model could be used to predict low- and heavy-loss areas of Nigeria.Laboratory studies on the combined effect of temperature and relative humidity on the length of time it takes for the disease to appear were undertaken. It was found that the lower humidities (less than 80%) and higher humidities (greater than 85%) delay the appearance of the disease even at favourable temperatures (23--25C). It was also noted that higher humidities (equal to or greater than 90%` were favourable for sporulation.|Theses collection|computer model / cocoa black pod disease*||||||Haastrup Adedeji|Male|The Status of Instructional Media in the Teaching of Biology in Selected Secondary Schools in Oyo State of Nigeria||||||M.

The provision of adequate stimulating environment for learning is a fundamental responsibility of the teacher. Therefore a study of the status of instructional media in the teaching of Biology seems justified.MethodologyThe instruments used for this study were mainly questionnaires for both Biology teachers and students. The instruments which were constructed by the investigator went through validation processes by the use of experts in education, and their reliabilities determined through test  retest method. Statistical analysis of the tenability determination gave a correlation coefficient of 0,73 and 0.82 respectively for the Teachers' and Students' questionnaires.The instruments were later administered to Biology teachers and students in 28 randomly selected secondary schools in thestate and their responses subjected to various forms of statistical analyses.v Results and ConclusionsFrom the analyses carried out, some results and conclusions appear to be justified. These include:1.	The status of instructional media in the teaching of Biology in secondary schools in Oyo State appears to be low, as only a few number of instructional media were available.2.	The use of instructional media, as could be expected, was, more often than not, restricted to the available instructional media.3.	Some problems militating against the availability and use of instructional media radiate on finance, infractructural constraints and inadequate training of Biology teachers.4.	A multiple correlation coefficient of 0.26 existed between the qualifications and experience of Biology teachers and their extent of use of instructional media.ImplicationsFrom this study, there are some implications for Biology education in particular and education in general in the state.1. There is the need to raise the status of instructionalmedia in teaching generally but more important in science.2.	Since the government has taken over the responsibility for funding of education, more efforts should be made by the State Government to provide varying instructional media to meet learner requirements.3.	There is the need to restructure Teacher education programmes to include the provision and use of instructional media.|Theses collection|Instructional Media/ Biology*||||||Adeboyeje Rueben Adepoju|Male|The Relationship between School Climate and Academic Achievement in Selected Secondary Schools in Ondo State of Nigeria.||||||M.

The main hypothesis was: There will be no significant relationship between school climate and academic achievement in secondary schools in Ondo State.Opinionaires designated Modified School Climate Opinionaires for Teachers (MSCOT) and Modified School Climate Opinionaire for Students (MSCOS) were used to collect data on the perceived climates of the schools,and the School Certificate examination results for 1978 and 1979 formed the data for academic achievement. The data, thus collected, were analysed with the use of such statistical techniques as the mean, the t-test and chi-square, to examine the hypotheses.The main findings of this study can be summarized as follows:(1)	According to the teachers, there was a significant difference in the climates of secondary schools in Ondo State; but in the students' view, there was no significant difference(2)	While the teachers identified the paternal climate as the most prevalent in Ondo State secondary schools,(3)	There was a significant difference in the academic achievement of secondary schools in Ondo State.(4) Based on 0.05 level of significance and 10 degrees of freedom, the observed relationship between the teachers' opinion on school climate and the identified standards of academic achievement was significant, but the observed relationship between the students' view on schoolclimate and the identified standards of academic achievement was not significant(5) Based on the separate opinions of the teachers and the students on school climates, there was no agreement between the teachers and the students as to the type of school climate that facilitated a particular type of academic achievement.	Based on the findings just listed, the investigator suggested that other researches could be undertaken to identify the relationship between school climates and academic achievement in other secondary schools in Ondo State. To collect data on school climates, suchresearches could design a single instrument for both teachers and students, rather than have one each for the teachers and the students as done in this study. Further,other studies could look into the relationship between academic achievement and other factors such as the home background of the students, societal values, production resources, and the innate abilities of the students. It would also be fruitful if other investigations could be carried out on the relationship between school climate and the job satisfaction of members of staff; the relationship between school climate and the boarding department; and the relationship between school climate and the political atmosphere of the society.In terms of practice, it was suggested that educational administrators should strive to improve upon the qualities of the climates of their schools. A strategy that could be employed in this connection, it was suggested, is struggling for improvement in the qualities of the principals' leadership styles.|Theses collection|school climate and academic achievement*||||||Adediran Segun|Male|The Lake Chad Basin Commission: Development, Problems and Prospects.||||||M.

It is believed that Nigeria could bamboozle those countries dependent on her oil supplies to listen and act according to her dictates; and that, because of her oil wealth, Nigeria has become a 'middle-power' with global strategic significance.The primary objective of the present study is to test the validity of the above-mentioned assumptions. The period of study begins at the end of the Nigerian Civil War in 1970 end terminates with the inauguration of the new civilian administration in 1979. It coincides with the era of the oil boom and the so-culled Nigeria's 'assertive' foreign policy.The findings of the study reveal that such assertion about Nigeria being an 'oil power' are more mythical than realistic, for the necessary policies were not evolved and executed to securely integrate the oil industry into the Nigerian economy. Therefore Nigeria was not capable, during the period under review, of employing oil as a weapon either in her African policy or in her relations with the power blocs.|Theses collection|Petroleum and Nigeria's Foreign  Policy, 1970 - 1579 / Nigeria's oil wealth / Nigerian economy*||||||Adeleke Frederick Adekunle|Male|"United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Western Nigeria a study||||||M.

As presently constituted Western Nigeria is one of the twelve States created in Nigeria by Military Decree in Nay 1967. With a population of 9,487,525 (1963 Census)', and covering about 30,000 square miles, it is mainly an agricultural State whose vegetation falls within the normal tropical pattern.The State's economy is very vulnerable being dependent to a very large extent on cocoa, of which it is the second largest producer in the world. Its forests account for more than 40% of the timber exported from Nigeria. Extensive farm mechanization and extension services pro-grammes for the peasant farmers are currently being developed.The State is growing steadily in the field of industrial development while education development has been most remarkable. There are two Universities - University of Ife, established by the State Government in 1962 and the University of Ibadan set up in 1948 by the Federal Government. There is a Polytechnic as well as Trade Centres. There are hundreds of Teacher Training Colleges, Comprehensive High Schools, Grammar Schools, Secondary Modern Schools and non-fee paying Primary Schools and Nursery Schools.Medical, health, social welfare and rural development services are making significant strides under the government 's overall planning. The largest and latest of a wide range of modern water supply schemes executed in the State, the N22 million Asejire Water Supply Scheme, supplies Ibadan with some twenty million gallons of water daily.No work would appear to be available on the influence of aid on the economy and development of this State. This study therefore aims at meeting this deficiency.The dissertation is divided into four parts and eight chapters. The first part made up of two chapters examines the philosophy of foreign assistance in general with some emphasis on the guidelines of American aid. Chapter two of this part is a general view of the procedure for granting United States aid to Nigeria and a description of some of the major projects in operation all over the country. Part Two, chapters three, four and five describe the USAID Technical assistance projects in the West. The sixth chapter in Part Three analyses the only Development Loan Project for the construction of the Asejire Water Supply Scheme.Part Four, Chapters Seven and Sight titled "Overall Assessment" and "Conclusion" are summaries of the operations and impact of aid on the development of the Western State and the influence, if any, of American presence on Nigeria's attitude to the United States generally.

This rise was extremely rapid for the first hour of illumination and thereafter became more gradual. Heat hardened onion (Alium cepa) leaves behaved similarly to tomato leaves with regards to dark exposure while darkness did not seem to cause any appreciable difference in the heat tolerance of hardened onion epidermis exposed to darkness for up to 48 hrs.Studies in which the ambient temperature of the dark period were kept at 5-320C revealed a higher decline in heat tolerance at the lowest temperature of the dark period and a lower decline at the highest temperature of the dark period.Observed differences in hardened tomato plants subjected to a total of 72 hr darkness either given continuously or in 2, 3 or 6 equal doses separated by one hour light were not significant, suggesting that the decline in heat tolerance was not under photoperiodiccontrol.Detachment of leaves resulted in a decrease in heat tolerance, even when such leaves were kept in continuous light.

Mitotic selection, fluorodeoxyuridine (FdU) and hydroxyurea (HU) blocks were techniques used for synchronization.Cells that were labeled with 3H-thymidine for a short period of time (10 - 20 minutes) at the beginning or at the end of one S phase were given a density label by providing bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) at both early and late periods of a subsequent S phase. In CsCl density gradients, a shift of the initial 3H label to the hybrid density was used as measure of the amount of correlation in phase regulated replication of the DNA.The percent 3H or 14C shifted with the density labeled, newly formed hybrid showed that there is a good degree of temporal correlation between DNA's synthesized in the earlyportion of any two S phases and likewise for the DNAreplicated at the end of any two S phases. The results of the CsCl centrifugation also revealed that DNA synthesizedin the early part of any S phase has a higher bouyant density than the average for total DNA, while DNA replicated late in the S phase banded in a position indicating a lower bouyant density (lower G+C/A+T ratio) than native DNA.Hydroxyapatite was also used to separate DNA's synthesized early and late in the S phase into highly repetitive and non-repetitive fractions. In addition, by using hydroxyapatite chromatography it was found that the highly repetitive DNA isolated from the DNA synthesized in the first ten mintes of an S phase contained a higher proportion of G+C sequences than the remaining DNA. The highly repetitive fraction isolated from DNA synthesized late in the S phase had a base composition indistinguishable from total DNA. The non-repetitive DNA sequences isolated from DNA's synthesized in both early and late S phase have base composition similar to the total DNA.The information obtained from the density labeling experiments and hydroxyapatite chromatography, when integrated with related findings, suggest that certain G+C rich sequences preferentially replicated at the beginning of the S phase are either structural entities in the initiation complex for DNA synthesis or structural genes that are preferentially synthesized in the early part of the S phase.|Theses collection|Programming of DNA Synthesis / Nature of DNA Synthesized at Different Times / S Phase of the Cell Cycle of a Eucaryotic System*||||||Adegoke Joseph Adeleke|Male|Comparison of the Base Compositions of the Highly Repetitive, the Intermediate Repetitive and Non-Repetitive DNA of Chinese Hamster Cells||||||1972|J.

It was based on the main assumption that the Board was a tool in the hands of power machines. Using a model contributed by the study,the power machines were traced to the Ministryof Education, the school Principal, an informal Group outside the Board, or a Board member. Also contributedby the study were two main instruments, one a questionnaire and the other an opinionnaire, to test a) whether the Board clearly understood its role; b) whether the Board was unduly influenced in its decision-making process; and c)whether the Board was restricted in the exercise of its powers as a decision-making body. The results were corroborated by the data collected from records and from a direct observation of one of the Board's meetings.There was a descriptive analysis which yielded the following main findings among others:1)	That the Board of Governors studied had both a formal and informal structures of power.But the former structure was stronger.2) That the background education and the level of experience at decision-making of the members were generally high. 3)	That there were evidences to show that theBoard might have adequately understood its role.4)	That no undue influence on the Board's decisionmaking process was observed.5)	That owing to some occasional failings reportedin the role of the Ministry of education,restriction could sometimes be placed in theway of the Board of Governors in the exerciseof its powers.6)	That the main assumption that the Board couldbe a tool in the hands of power machines wasnot found true in this case.These findings lead to the following main conclusions:1)	That since Tokunbo Grammar School Board of Governors has such a structure of power in decision-making process, it is likely to be an effective instrument of government. That shoes that it is not impossible to find one or more Boards of Governors in the Western State of Nigeria which are effective instruments of Government.2)	That it is likely that the members of Tokunbo Grammar School Board were assisted in the perception of their role by their level ofeducation and their experience at educational decision-making.3)	That the Board has the ability to make good decisions but it can be rendered ineffective if it does not receive the necessary cooperation from those concerned in its interactions4)	That in the Western State of Nigeria, the interactions of the Ministry of Education with the Boards of Governors needs a close examination.Arising out of these findings and conclusions are the following issues suggested for future research:1)	Could the findings and conclusions for the one governing board studied here be true of all boards of governors in the Western State?If not what factors other than those already identified in this study could be responsible?2)	What is the role of the Ministry of Education in its day-to-day interaction with Boards of Governors in the implementation of boarddecisions on school and educational matters?3)	Are the newly set-up State School Board and the Local School Boards better alternatives to the previously existing boards of governors in the administration of public school education it the State?What further improvements are needed in the analytical instruments constructed for evaluating the decision--making process inthis study to make them universally applicable in the study of power  and decision-making for education?|Theses collection|Administration of  secondary school / Boards of Governors*||||||Afolabi Oladapo A.|Male|Chemical composition of some seeds of  nutritional importance in Nigeria. ||||||M.

It therefore, investigates some firms executing such works with the view to assessing their current management practices, their performance standards and ascertaining their management constraints.The investigation involves a survey of 27 firms of various sizes and background with housing sites scattered at Festac Town and Ipaja Housing Estates in Lagos. The result of the survey shows that the present basis for grouping of housing sites and contracts produce unsatisfactory operation; that the current planning tool and control techniques are inadequate for repetitive housing construction with scattered sites and contracts, which in some cases, involves different house types and starting periods; that there is abscence of coordinated policy, in the firms, in guiding efforts for optimal use of resources as sites and contracts get scattered; that overtrading and poorfinancial management, in addition, to delay in measurement of and payment for certified works create liquidity problem for the firms.Company and site organisations which are haphazard show two broad management control practices among the firms. In one, work progresses from one completed housing cluster to the other. Here, labour force is not continuously employed, resulting in delays in converging and dispersing the workers. In the other, work progresses for all clusters in a contract at once. Here, scarce physical and managerial resources are duplicated.Bearing in mind the absence of a rational management system for dealing with mass housing construction on scttered sites, the study suggests a practice. In the practice, physical separation of the housing clusters, housing typology and timing of individual contract with respect to ongoing contracts are emphasized in planning and controlling operations. Thepractice is tested on a case study involving a selected housing scheme and was found to be adequate.

The digestive enzymes and the absorptive capacity of the gut were studied. The pattern in which the' food of the fish varied with seasons and sizes of fish was examined. Adaptive morphology of the alimentary canal was studied.The results show that the time of feeding was between .6 a.m. and 8 p.m. daily with no feeding during the hours of the night. During the day however, there were evidence of variation in feeding intensity with time, with the peak period of feeding lying between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m.	Hydrogen ion concentration along the gut was between 1.1 and 9.5, with the stomach maintaining an acid state while the intestine was alkaline.The nature of the food of S. galilaeus varied with size of fish,	Thus the fry fed mostly on zooplankton, while the juveniles and adults fed on phytoplankton. Forty-seven planktonic genera were identified in the stomach of the fish, and these showed marked seasonal variation.Green algae were predominant between January and April. Diatoms were taken between May and July, while blue-green algae were the main plankton in the diet for the rest ofthe year. The food contained normal ranges of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, crude fibre and essential mineral elements common in fish diets. Twenty amino acids, including the ten indispensable ones for fishes were detected when food taken from the gut was analysed. Phospholipids, fatty acids and triglycerides were present in the food. On the other hand, sterols (cholesterol and cholesterol esters) were found to be synthesized by the fish. Crude fibreswere very low in the diets of all sizes of fish. The concentration of protein was very high in food of the young, but decreased in diets of larger fish. The nutritional factors of the diet vary with seasons of the year and with fish size.Common gut enzymes include carbohydrases, pro-Leases and lipases. Amylase occurred throughout the length of the gut. Maltase was found only in the adult fish. Pancreatic tissues were found to be the richest source of lipid digesting enzymes. Region I of the intestine which represents the first  of this part of the gut, was the major sites of digestion in the fish.The absorptive capacity of different section of the gut varied. Region II of the intestine was the major site of absorption in the fish. The percentage of different food absorbed varied. Region III of the intestine was responsible for water absorption in the fish.The morphology of the alimentary canal was similar to those of other herbivores, with characteristic long intestine. The intestine consists of three regions identified by colour variations.	These regions also varied in length.|Theses collection|Nutrition in Sarotherodon galilaeus/ Fish*||||||Oforah Chukwudi Cyprian|Male|STUDIES ON RETROGRADATION OF STARCHES OF YAM (Dioscorea rotundata), COCOYA.M(Xanthosoma sagittifolium), AND CASSAVA Manihot utilissima)||||||M.

The starches were gelatinized after pH adjustment with hydrochloric acid or ammonium hydroxide, pH values range from 2 to 10 at 1 unit interval. The extent of retrogradation of 8% starch pastes on ageing at room temperature was determined by measuring the optical density of starch-iodine complex in an aqueous supernatant. This is indicative of the cold water solubility of ageing starch molecules. Cassava starch showed least retrogradation at pH 4.o while yam and cocoyam starches showed least retrogradation at pH 6.0. This was attributed to the formation of starch molecules of least retrogradation tendency through fragmentation. An attempt was also made to control retrogradation in yam flour, cocoyam flour, and gari. Raw yam tubers were diced and soaked in citrate buffer, pH 6.0 (prepared from citric acid and sodium citrate) for 10 minutes, steam-blanchedfor 20 minutes and dried at 70C to 135 moisture content. The product obtained retrograded less rapidly than that obtained by soaking in pyrophosphate buffer pH 6.0 (prepared from tetrasodium pyrophosphate and orthophosphoric acid) or sodium metabisulphite pH 6.0 (prepared from sodium metabisulphite and sodium sulphite). This was attributed to the positions of the anions in the Hofmeister series and slight esterification of starch molecules by citrate ions. Cocoyam processed similarly showed least retrogradation with the application of pyrophosphate buffer, pH 6.0. Gari sprayed with pyrophosphate buffer, pH 4.0 (prepared from tetrasodium pyrophosphate and orthophosphoric acid) to 38 % moisture content and dried at 70C to 12% moisture content retrograded less rapidly than the control.|Theses collection|Retrogradation of starches of yam/ Cocoyam/ Cassava*||||||Afolabi Michael Oluwole|Male|Labour Turnover in a Publishing Firm CKC Press (Nigeria) Ltd.

The attachment served to give insights into problems in Nigeria especially in government-owned ventures.The study was also undertaken to evaluate the effective ness of working capital management in a government-owned business.The Lafia Canning Factory was selected because it is a unique business venture. Lafia is a monopoly firm which produces canned fruit. The company, however, has not been financially successful. The study concentrates on the role which working capital has played in the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the firm.The study relates the management of working capital in the Lafia Canning Factory compared with theory as discussed in the relevant literature, particularly with respect to profitability of the organisation.The study finds that the practice of working capital management at the factory has conformed to the theoretical models. The empirical evidence suggests that the poor results are attributable to the facts that the firm operates like other government departments with general orders and financial instructions being followed routinely and this has been a lack of efficient working capital management.|Theses collection|Canning Factory/ Lafia Canning Factory, Ibadan /working capital management *||||||Afolabi James Adeola|Male|DETERIORATION AND CONSERVATION OF BIBLI0GRAPHIC RESOURCES IN NIGERIAN LIBRARIES: HEZEKIAH OLUWASANMI LIBRAVY UNIVERSITY OF IFE, ILE-IFE AS A CASE STUDY.||||||M.L.S  Library Studies|G.

The assumptions are:1)	In Nigeria, as elsewhere in the world, the causes of bibliographic deterioration could be traced to the following factors:(a)	Inherent,(b)	External, and(c)	Structural.2) Conservation should form part of the core professicnalduties of librarians in Nigeria.3) Practising librarians in Nigeria do not have pertinent qualification and adequate experience in conservation work,4) The resources available for conservation work inNigerian libraries are grossly inadequate.5) In Nigeria, librarians are mostly concerned with the orthodox professional duties of bibliographic collection, organisation and dissemination.The assumptions were tested by means of a questionnaire designed and sent to the library under study and which was filled and returned. Thereafter, a personal,on the spot observation of facts, resources and facilities was undertaken coupled with unstructural random interview of some of the library staff, It was found that the causative agents of deterioration of bibliographic resourcesare: (1) acidity in paper during the manufacturing processes(2)	environmental factors - particularly those associated with temperature, light, humidity, theft insects and flood;(3)	structural factors due mostly to usage and handling.However, the study revealed that though librarians in the library are fully aware of the need for untiring conservation work in libraries, their current approach to the effort is not quite modern due mainly to many inadequacies such as the lack of good knowledge of modern scientific conservation themselves and insufficient resources and facilities. While these librarians do have a good high quality academic and librarianship qualifications; and most do have sufficient professional and working experience none (at least in the staff of University of Ife library) has a recognised pertinent  training and qualification in the field of bibliographic conservation, Certainly, this is a reflection of most, if not all, of Nigerian libraries since a University library demands the best of the highly qualified professional staff in a nation's library service.The facilities or resources for conservation work are insufficient for reasonable work and efforts to be done in the field of bibliographic conservaion. The study clearly shows that there is hardly any conservation laboratory or workshop as well as the absence of disaster or contigency plans designed for conservation effort.Consequently, conservation works at the moment depend on the conventional individual room airconditioning facilities and binding which are sparsely used in conjunction with daily cleaning and proper shelving of resources and the emphatic express wish to do something more positive in no distant future.However, by way of general overview, Nigeriansituation with regards to the causative agents of deterioration is similar to those in advanced countries of the world where enormous scientific experiments have been done on the phenomenon. As a positive measure to follow the foot steps of the advanced countries, the dissertation ends with a suggestion for a national body to be known as Nigerian Association for Bibliographic Conservation (N A B C ) whose primary duty will be the prolongationof the life of bibliographic resources in Nigerian libraries.|Theses collection|Deterioration and conservation of bibliographic resources/Bibliographic resources in Nigerian Libraries/Nigerian Libraries*||||||Afolayan Samuel Sunday|Male|Lakeside Resort, Asa Dam, Ilorin  "Home of Tourists (Leisure, Business and Educational) in Ilorin and its environs||||||M.

Hence, the object of this thesis is to design a tourist resort, articulately linked to facilitate unbriddled natural flow of spaces from the slopy terrain outwards onto the lake providing enough recreational facilities of diverse nature to hold the interest of a sizeable cross-sections of would be tourists.Research ObjectivesDue to the fact that the tourist industry is consistently developing in Nigeria, the demand for local tourism facilities is becoming remarkable and should havea proper solution in terms of cost as well as of typological standard. The objectives of making such a problem-solving research are based on four main premises:i	To identify the different tourist activities in the country and survey their corresponding typologies.ii)	To develop a model of touristic organisation inside a territorial system  here the Asa Lakeside.iii)	To study the standandization of elements of touristic complex that could be adopted in different context with a minimum of adjustments to suit the particular climatic and cultural zones.iv)	To establish the "minimum standard" that should be adopted in a tourist complex and reflect same in the final design.Method of ResearchLiterature review on existing tourist centres, to determine the typological standards for different form of tourist activities.Analysis of some existing tourists centres in Nigeria with space standards and costinuse of alternative typologies adopted.Analysis of existing construction technologies in the area of the project and the possibility of adopting this in the complex with or without moderations.Study of an appropriate construction system based on the use of local material both to minimize the over-all cost of the project and to make the design blend with its immediate environment.Scope of StudyThis study addressed itself to the identification of tourist activities in Nigeria and the standardization of elements of a touristic complex that could be adopted in different context.Chapter one of the study gives an introductory analysis of tourist activities in Nigeria.Chapter two gives an overview of tourism in Kwara State-the existing tourist attractions, their locations  and a critque of accommodation facilities for would-be touristsChapter three deals with site analysis - the geographical, architectural and infrastructural possibilities.In Chapter four, a number of case studies of existing tourist centres in Nigeria andthe  typological standards provided for in their respective designs are considered.Chapter five, gives the space needs and quantitative data of space provided for in the brief.Chapter six, the concluding chapters delves into:i)	the over-all planning of the siteii)	the design proposalsiii)	the construction technology to be adopted and materials to be specified.i)	iv) the recommendation for maintenance strategies when the Resort village is in use.Conclusion:This is derived from works of reference documented into the text and personal observations.

These are (1) the use of trained tappers and the tappers training scheme at the Rubber Research Institute of Nigeria, (2) adoption of bud and or clonal rubber, (3) adoption of rubber replanting scheme, (4) use of ethrel and (5) the adoption of the aid scheme of the Nigerian Rubber Board.A total of one hundred and twenty five (125) rubber farmers were interviewed with the aid of structured interview schedule and the analysis used was frequencies and percentages. The result of the analysis showed that 70.4 to 95.2 percent of the respondents claimed awareness of at least one of the rubber innovations. On the other hand, 19.2 to 69.6 percent have tried at least one of the innovations and 16.8 to 68.8 percent of the respondents have fully adopted at least one of the innovations.The factors identified, which contributed to adoption of these innovations by farmers were contact with extension agents and radio, cosmopoliteness of farmers, characteristics of the innovations and farmers membership of co-operative societies.Other factors mentioned, which militated against adoption of rubber innovations included lack of labour, high cost of production, lack of credit, lack of input	and uncooperative attitude of some officers.The conclusions were (i) that three out of the five rubber innovations were highly adopted. These were the use of trained tappers; adoption of bud and or clonal rubber; and use of the aid scheme of the Nigerian Rubber Board. (ii) Mass media was found to be inadequately used, except for radio in a single innovation. (iii) The extension personnel of the Ministry of Agriculture were largely responsible for the dissemination of research findings on rubber and (iv) there is a high level of awareness (70.4 to 95.2 percent) relative to low adoption of 16.8 to 68.8 percent.The recommendations included (i) provision of creditto rubber farmers for replanting; (2) increased utilisation of mass media, through organised radio listening forum by extension agents; (3) strengthening the extension division of the Ministry of Agriculture for effective dissemination of research findings to rubber farmers and provision of inputs on regular and timely basis.|Theses collection|Agricultural innovations/Rubber innovations/Rubber farmers*||||||Adamolekun Ladipo Olu|Male|Administrative Science in Francophone West Africa||||||M.

The study reveals that all francophone West Africa accept the existence of an Administrative science largely because of their common contact with the French conception through colonial experience  a contact the French themselves have nurtured and promoted by providing both human and material resources for the creation of special schools charged with its dissemination. From a case study of three representative special schools we come to the conclusion that there are two conceptions of Administrative Science in Francophone west Africa both of which are built around three strands of courses inherited from France: general culture courses, specialization courses and professional training. One of these conceptions adopts most of the French content, adapting only certain aspects of it to suit local realities. This is illustrated by two of our case studies  the Parisbased Francophone School of Administration(Chapter II) and the Senegalese National School of Administration (Chapter III)  with the latter shoving greater adaptation than the former. Our third case study reveals how Guinea, by considering content as a reflection of clearly defined national training objectives, has, through its revolutionary political philosophy, radically modified all three strands of the French content to produce a distinctively Guinean conception of Administrative science. The organization and development of the representative schools are discussed in Chapters II, III and IV and attention is drawn to both their achievements and problems.

Within three decades, it has seen five wars and vast ravages and destruction. Moreover, its special mark in International Relations has been the conflict and enimity existing between the Arabs and Israelis living in the region. The conflict has, particularly in 1973, threatened to involve the superpowers, i.e. the US and USSR in direct military confrontation with catastrophic consequences for the whole world. This background underlines the importance of the period from Jerusalem to Camp David and makes it worthy of study.This period (covering from November 1977 to March 1979) witnessed a remarkable peace-process in the Middle-East. The peace-process which was set in motion by Egyptian President Anwar el Sadat's trip to Jerusalem eventually resulted in a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, thus ending the state of war that had existed between them for thirty years.This dissertation undertakes a study of the development of this phenomenon. The study begins by analysing the motivations of the Sadat initiative. It then proceeds to examine and account for the reactions of other states to the initiative and the consequent developments leading up to the Camp David Accords in September 1978. Furthermore, it looks at the content of the Accords and the period between it and the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in March 1979. In this respect, it attempts to identify the nature and sources of the problems that delayed the process. Finally, the study concludes by evaluating the significance of the peace-treaty in terms of its implications and prospects.|Theses collection|The Middle-East Peace Process/The Arabs and Israelis /Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty*||||||Adigun Mathew Olusegun|Male|Automatic Token Generator for a Data Definition Language||||||M.

However, some problems such as the rural exodusof the virile labour force, absence or poor physical infra-structural facilities, poor storage and marketing facilities, lack of credit and technical know-how have subjected the farmers particularly the small-holder to small scale production.To extricate the farmers from the unsatisfactory farming situation and help them break-out of the vicious cycle of poverty, disease and ignorance the state government established a number of institutions to serve them.One of such institutions is the Investment and Credit Corporation of Oyo State (ICCOS), the agricultural lending activities of which is the focus of this study. Granted that credit facility should be made available to small-scale farmer, however, determing the right amount of credit to give to a farmer-borrower is a problem to credit institutions because granting too little or too much credit may be counter productive.This study investigates the loan activities of the Investment and Credit Corporation of Oyo State. The organizational and operational structures of the agricultural credit department of the corporation as well as its effectiveness in agricultural loan administration were examined. Based on farmers' responses, the study highlights the need to grant adequate and timely loans to farmers, to simplify lending procedures and to create loan bases so as to encourage more farmers to benefit from credit services.It is recommended that granting of loan should be decentralized so that zonal officers can grant the small-holder farmer credit. The administrative procedure should be simplified to ensure loan timeliness while concerted efforts should be made to collect the repayment as at when due to make the system self-sustaining.|Theses collection|Agriculture/Investment and Credit Corporation/Agricultural Credit Delivery System*||||||Adeyemo F.

The efforts of third party mediators failed because of the conflicting interpretations placed on Resolution 242 of 22 November 1967.The first section is, of course, the introductory section which examines the terms conflict, conflict resolution and its techniques. It also examines the term third party.The second section takes a look at the brief historical background to the Arab--Israeli conflict up to 1967. It also deals with the efforts of the United Nations through the Security Council and the General Assembly. In addition, it examines reasons for the failure of the UN efforts to find a peaceful settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict.The third section concentrates on the efforts of the major powers as third party mediators to the Middle East conflict. Furthermore, it examines the efforts of the 0AU in the Middle East conflict.The final section deals with the conclusion and suggestions likely to resolve the Arab--Israeli conflict.|Theses collection|Third party mediation in the Arab-Israeli Conflict 1967-1973/ Arab--Israeli conflict/United Nations (UN)/ The Organisation of African Unity (OAU)*||||||Adewunmi Adenike Omotayo|Female|Geochemical investigation of soil, stream sediment and surface water samples in Ilesha Area and their probable relationships to the surrounding rock types||||||M.

Soils overlying gneisses and mica schists were found to be higher in alumina and iron - oxides, while soils over quartzite were higher in silica.Stream sediments were found to consist mostly of quartz while considerable low values of elemental concentrations in water were recorded.It was shown that soils in the area retain the geochemical characteristics of the underlying bedrock. While stream sediments and water were found not to serve as useful tools in the characterisation of the bedrock.It is therefore, suggested that the geology of this area can be inferred from the soil composition.|Theses collection|Geochemical survey/Source rock materials and weathering products/Soil composition.*||||||Adenigbagbe Victor  Sola|Male|COLD WAR IN AFRICA : A CASE-STUDY OF THE CONGO CRISIS (1960 - 1964)||||||M.

The attitude of a significant proportion of the subjects from Ife University undergraduates towards personal and social counselling was positive.There was	significant relationship between the degree of social and personal problems of students and their willingness to face counselling sessions.3.Adolescent undergraduates were more willing to discuss their social and personal problems than adults.4. Sex of the subjects and their socio-economic background did not make a significant difference to students'attitude towards social and personal counselling.In addition to the above there was strong evidence that students realised the relationship between personal/social counselling and educational/vocational counselling.It was therefore suggested that a Guidance Counselling centre or Unit should be established in Ife University campus. It is recommended than the Federal Government should assist in funding the proposed counselling centre.	Nigerian counsellors should be trained to handle both educational as well as personal and social problems.|Theses collection|under-graduates/social and personal counselling/educational/vocational counselling *||||||Adedinsewo Adewale C.|Male|The marketing distribution  pathern and promotional activities of a pharmaceutical company.

Each of the two forms of G6PD had a molecular weight of 126,000 at pH 8.0 and 251,000 at pH 6.5 when gel-filtered on Sephadex G-200 column. The molecular weight of G6PD11 obtained by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 8.0 was 117,000 in the absence of NADPH+ and 238,000 in the presence of NADP'- . The sub-unit molecular weight of G6PDI was 57,000 while that of G6PD11 was 59,500. Thus, each enzyme form can exist either as a dimer or tetramer depending on the pH andthe concentration of NADP+ .	Isoelectric focusing revealed that G6PDI had pi values of 5.85 and 6.05 while G6PDII had a pI of 5.85. An analysis of N-terminal amino acid of G6PD11 revealed that it was blocked. The two C6PD forms also had similar KmNADP and KaNADP values. However, the KmG6P of G6PDI was 4 times higher than that of G6PDII. The Vmax of G6PD11 was much higher than that of G6PD1.

The risk of infection developing in surgical wounds is dependent on a number of factorsincluding patient, personnel and the environment.	The study was undertaken to determine the importance of patients, personnel and airborne microbes in the operating room as sources of intraoperative contamination of clean wounds at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife.A total of one hundred and one patients were monitored for postsurgical clean wound infection in this study. Swabs of the anterior nares of patients and attending surgical staff were cultured on blood and mannitol salt agar, while samples of incision site of patients were obtained with sterile cotton tipped applicators prior to skin closure and plated on blood agar. Aerial contamination of the operating suite was assessed by exposing settle plates containing various bacteriological media. Inanimate items in the operating room were routinely swabbed and plated on blood agar. Bacterial isolates were identified by bacteriological methods, while fungal isolates were identified based only on their cultural and morphological characteristics. Phage typing of Staphylococcus aureus isolates 'recovered from patients and attending surgical staff was performed using the present international set of typing phages and the antibiotic sensitivity patterns of these strains were determined by the agar diffusion method.The incidence of clean wound infection in this study was 1.98% and a mortality rate of 2.97% was observed. The mean colony count per plate per hour (c. p. h) of microbes on settle plates ranged from 1.1 - 49.4 and 0.9 - 74.6 colonies in the operating room and exit area of the operating suite respectively. No correlation was found between the total number of bacteria and the incidence of postoperative clean wound infection. The nasal carriage rates of Staphylococcus aureus isolates among patients and attending surgical staff were 12.8% and 17.9% respectively. The phage typing of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered from patients and attending surgical staff revealed that group III and non typeable strains were predominant. All the Staphylococcus aureus isolates were resistant to penicillin, while 55.6% were resistant to tetracycline.	In addition, 17.2% and 13.8% were resistant to chloramphenicol and streptomycin respectively. Sixteen percent of the wound swabs taken prior to skin closure showed bacterial growth but none of these wounds developed infection.The study revealed that coagulase negative staphylococci were the predominant organisms associated with clean wound colonization and that sources of. intraoperative bacterial contamination of the woundwere the patients microflora and the operating room air.|Theses collection|Postoperative wound infection/prolonged hospitalization of surgical patients/intraoperative contamination of clean wounds*||||||Adewumi  V.

Also, adsorption-elution, gel-permeation, and high temperature-programmed gas-liquid chromatographic techniques were used to investigate the affinity of the three solvent systems towards asphalt and the result obtained for the three systems were compared.In general, the results obtained indicated that the vacuum residue is paraffinic, having a viscosity index of 131, viscosity gravity constant of 0.8665 and an average molecular weight of 1480, all of which make it suitable for lube-oil manufacture.In addition, it was found that both nitrobenzene and phenolwater-ether mixture have higher affinity for the undesirable non-paraffinic compounds than furfural at the deasphalting temperature of 450C. However, maximum yield of the most desirable deasphalted oil was obtained at a lower solvent-residue ratio for nitrobenzene.From the discussion of the results, the phenol-water-ether mixture appears to be the best among the solvent systems investigated, for deasphalting Nigerian vacuum residue.|Theses collection|CHARACTERIZATION AND DEASPHALTING OF VACUUM RESIDUE OF NIGERIAN MEDIUM CRUDE*||||||Adewumi David Olambo|Male|DIGITAL SIMULATION OF STOCHASTIC DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS APPLIED TO WIENER AND POISSON PROCESSES||||||M.

In doing this, the dissertation examines the Ministry's role as an essentially coordinating, regulatory, conciliatory and advisory agency in the Public Service of Oyo State.Respondents to the questionnaire administered to civil servants, and trade union leaders, and the interviews had with the officials of statutory bodies in the state during the survey generally agreed that the civil service regulations (the General Orders) should continue to be in existence but that the provisions should be modified in line with the contemporary result  oriented Public Service philosophy. It was also discovered that there appears to be industrial harmony in the Oyo State Public Service through efficient handling of staff matters. The analysis of the data collected from the survey clearly shows thatthere is limited job satisfaction in the public service and this accounts for the high turnover to the private sector. Besides, majority of the respondents agreed that there is excessive delay in the giving of approval for the filling of vacant posts by the Ministry of Establishments and Training resulting in the shortage of staff in some Departments. Finally, it was discovered that there is absence of customer sensitivity in the State's Public Service with the result that members of the public are not treated fairly, expeditiously and without being inconvenienced.The suggestions offered for improvements are that approvalfor filling of vacancies in the public service should be expedited and that appointment of officers to GL.0106 should be delegated to the Permanent Secretary of each Ministry or the head of each Department. This would contrast with the present arrangement whereby only levels 01-05 are being administered by the Chief Executives of the Ministries/Departments. The Public Service Commission should, continue to deal with personnel matters for Senior Staff (GL.0715)as it does presently. It is also suggested that the staff employed by the Government should be temperamentally suitable so as not to inconvenience the public and that the service conditions should be made more attractive to stop the rapid turnover of staff to the private sector.|Theses collection|Administration of the Public Service/Ministry of Establishments and Training/Public Service of Oyo State.*||||||Adewumi Clement Oladapo|Male|THE EFFECT OF PROLONGED ADMINISTRATION.

The challenge will arise because, unless some people are to be denied its benefits, secondary education must be developed and expanded far beyond anything in all of its previous history and present demands.Projections, surveys and well meaning comments already indicate that within the next few years, secondary school enrolments will be doubled, especially taking into account the present large number of Universal free primary education enrolees who, after graduating from the primary school will have to find avenues of continuing their education in the secondary schools. The implications of the projected secondary school enrolments are many, One of these is that plant and other physical facilities must not only be provided and expanded, but they, in addition, must be well operated, properly maintained, safely insured, and clearly accounted for.Before the envisaged demands are put on our secondary schools, this study has therefore explored and attempted to evaluate the present status of school plant management in 8 selected secondary grammar schools in the Ondo Local Schools Board area. Th. aim of this pioneering effort was to offer some suggestions, depending on the outcome of the study, not only on how to achieve quality education, but how to provide this quality education under adequate, safe learning conditions, and of course, at theleast possible financial cost. Additionally, the "lighthouse" effect of the study will help to draw the attention of school administrators, other officials and research workers to some rich areas of school plant management.School plant administration covers a broad area of activities, but this study has confined itself only to school property management - that is, the operation, maintenance, insurance and accounting services of school physical plants.In order to get some direct light on the selected aspects of school plant administration, an intensive excursion was first made into :elated literature on this subject. With this theoretical backdrop, survey questionnaires were constructed and later administered on school officials and some other personnel charged with the responsibility of caring for, and maintaining physical plants in the selected schools. Ideas were also drawn through personal interviews and on-the-spot observation of school documents and records to double-check and supplement some of the responses given in the survey-questionnaires. This approach, apart from providingfor objectivity, also endeavoured throughout to let the school administrators tell us what they knew and did about school plant management.Collected data were synthesized and treated descriptively. At certain points however, simple statistical methods involving the use of percentages and tables were introduced to throw more light on the findings of the studyThe consensus of the findings of the study demonstrated that not enough attention has been paid to the management of school plants. Resultant can be said that only some efforts have been made to preserve the large financial values on school physical facilities, and to provide enough learning places for students. This is in effect saying that while therewere some "meeting-points" between the theory and practice of school plant management, yet, it can still be further claimed that there were certain lapses and shortcomings as revealed by this study, in the actual practice of school plant administration. We were led to believe this conclusion primarily on the strength of the analyzed data which on the one hand indicated that all the schools he d a maintenance department each which employed some custodians for the care and safe-keeping of school plants,and that major repairs and renovations to school buildings and other physical facilities were performed on contract basis. At the same time, the data pointed out the fewness of custodial staff, lack of guiding custodial policies, absence of any clearly stated conditions of service for custodians, small percentage of maintenance expenditures, inadequacy of building safety-devices, unavailability of clear specifications and regulations for insuring school plants; and the irregular procedures for registering school physical resources.Some implications of the results of the study which had been fully documented somewhere in this report, made it almost mandatory for one to recommend ways and means of action, by which school administrators, ministries of education, and all others who are interested in the positive growth of education in this country, Nigeria,, can attempt to improve the present unenviable and slipshod manner of administering and managing the school physical resources.Aptly put, one is very convinced of the important role which the ministries of education can play in improving the standard of school plant management, more so, when the government has taken over the administration of the schools. Besides, being the major financier of the schools, the government is at a vantage position to cease this singular opportunity to impress it upon school administrators, the importance of proper school plant administration, after all, it is said, "he who pays the piper, dictates the tune".No doubt, the degree of concerted and consciencious efforts at implementing the recommended suggestions, may well prove a hallmark in history at providing safe learning environments for our children, and at achieving quality education in Nigeria.|Theses collection|SCHOOL PLANT MANAGEMENT PRACTICE/Ondo State Secondary Schools/safe learning environments*||||||Adeyanju Albert Sunday|Male|Marketing in  domestic banking  National Bank of Nigeria Limited in perspective||||||M.

Competition for customers' deposits and competition for profit do exist through product differentiation, and this competition will increase with the establishment of more financial institutions and the expansion of the economy. Waiting for a new business to come to the bank will leadto mediocrity and stagnation. A positive and aggressive approach to search for and develop new business is essential. Marketing is a tool for change, it can help an organisation to become more dynamic, innovative and more responsive to the needs of those it tries to serve.To some banks, and the National Bank in particular, marketing is considered synonymous with personal selling.If it were possible to dispel this misconception of marketing and replace it with something like "Sensitivity to the needs of Customers", the Management may then strive to identify, anticipate and satisfy the needs of their customers through a properlyorganised marketing department. National Bank should no longer be complacent nor rely on its age and size to attract and hold clients. There is a need for a more thoughtful approach to meeting the requirements of its customers, and how these needs can be best and costeffectively provided. What is needed is a concerted marketing management approach. This paper examines whether the National Bank has aproperly  organised marketing department, and how it has been marketing its services in domestic banking. In the process, it was found that whatever marketing efforts that existed,were carried out on an individual or on a departmental basis. It was also found that the marketing activities are unplanned and uncoordinated under a single responsible officer. In recognition of the role which marketing can play in the development and growth of a company by satisfying the consumers' needsand wants, it was recommended among other things that a marketing department be set up.|Theses collection|Marketing/ National Bank of Nigeria Limited/financial Institutions/Banking*||||||Adeyemi Olawumi Emmanuel|Male|THE LINGUISTIC PROBLEMS OF TRANSLATING YORUBA LITERARY WORKS INTO ENGLISH: A CASE STUDY OF WOLE SOYINKA'S THE FOREST OF A THOUSAND DAEMONS||||||M.

Fagunwa's Ogbaju Ode Ninu Igbo Irunmale with the source text as a case study of the problems of translating Yoruba literary works into English. A comparative study of the texts reveals that form, figurative language, proper names and cultural items pose translation problems. The translator's competence, too, is found to be an essential consideration since this can make or mar a text, depending on whether or not the translator is competent. The weaknesses of $oyinka's translation are in the area of cultural items and the inconsistency in the handling of proper names. But perhaps, more than these is the norm he sets for himself to remain faithful to the textwriter, which he does to the point of producing unusual expressions. Finally, it is suggested in this thesis that translation could be of use in the pedagogy of English and that this research could help the nonYoruba speaking reader to understand and appreciate Soyinka's translation better.|Theses collection|figurative language/ proper names /cultural items /translation problems/The Forest of a Thousand Daemons /Wale Soyinka's translation of D.O.

There is a close correlation between the weight of the sorghum shoot and its dhurrin content during the early stages of growth.Cibberellic acid barely stimulates growth but this is accompanied by increased dhurrin synthesis.10-4M 2,4-Dinitrophenol (DNP) inhibits growth but stimulates dhurrin biosynthesis while 2 x 10-4M DNP inhibits both processes.Glyphosate is shown to principally inhibit the shikimic acid pathway but affects other physiological functions in Sorghum seedlings at high concentrations. The rate of dhurrin biosynthesis in the shoot is estimated at 17 nmol/hr and the breakdown rate is 5.4 nmol/hr. In the root, the rate of dhurrin biosynthesis is 4,1 nmol/hr and the catabolic rate is 1.4 nmol/hr.Every part of Sorghum seedling is capable of synthesizing and storing dhurrin.In rats, the LD50 of amygdalin is found to be 773 mg/kg BW. Amygdalin reduces total as well as Mg2+-dependent ATPase activities.Between 10 - 20% of the different concentrations of amygdalin administered to rats is excreted in the urine as the intact compound while 8 - 20% is excreted as thiocyanate.Finally there seems to be a close similarity between cyanide metabolism (detoxification) in both plants and animals.|Theses collection|CYAROGENIC GLYCOSIDE METABOLISM IN PLANTS AND ANIMALS/metabolism of dhurrin in green Sorghum seedlings/amygdalin in rats*||||||Adeyemi Michael Bamidele|Male|A STUDY OF SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS' VIEWS ON THE

The views were mainly linked with attributes of teachers, learners, instructional materials and funds, teaching methods and general issues on Social Studies, In addition, the study looked into the relationship that existed between the views of teachers and some observed classroom attributes relating to the teaching of Social Studies.Two instruments were used, a Questionnaire and an Observation Guide, Forty teachers were served with Questionnaire and observed in the fifteen schools offering Social Studies in Oranmiyan Local Government area of Oyo State,The results showed that:(a)	teachers with different educational background and training held the same views and agreed on the adequacy of their qualifications and their number, regular attendance at seminars and conferences and replacement of History, Geography and other related subjects with Social Studies in schools;(b)	teachers of various academic disciplines were of the same opinions and agreed that instructional materials and funds were inadequate, learners(a)	were more creative and more responsible thanin the past when Social Studies was compartmentalized and that teachers utilized the inquiry method and the integrated approach;(c) the investigator's observations showed a low relationship between the expected and the observed classroom attributes relating to the teaching of Social Studies.On the basis of the findings, the following suggestions were made:(1)	In-service courses should be organised for unqualified teachers in order to improve their quality of teaching Social Studies.(2)	There is the need for teachers to reform their teaching approach. This will enable the traditional teachers to be more up-to-date in their methods of teaching Social Studies,(3)	School authorities should provide adequate funds for the purchase of essential materials needed in the teaching of Social Studies.(4)	Teachers should be more dedicated to duty.(5)	There should be better conditions of service forteachers as their counterparts in other sectors ofpublic service. This will surely enhance the statusof teachers(6)	Teachers should be encouraged to write textbooks on Social Studies so as to make them available in the right quantity and quality.(7)	There is the need to make Social Studies compulsory in the West African School Certificate examinations because it deals with education for citizenship.There is also the need for further research of this type to confirm the findings or improve upon them|Theses collection|views of teachers on the teaching of integrated Social Studies/attributes of teachers/ learners/ instructional materials and funds/ teaching methods / general issues on Social Studies/*||||||Agagu A.|Male|K +K   Charge exchange cross section at thermal energies||||||M.

Associations among all traits were investigated also.The genotypes were grown in five environments (planting dates) at the Teaching and Research Farm, University of Ife, during the early season, 1981. The planting dates were 31 March; 9 and 14 April; 5 May and 1 June 1981,Grain yield ranged from 1.4 to 3.8 t/ha and 1.3 to 2.8 t/ha with averages of 2.9 and 2.3 t/ha for cultivar hybrids and cultivars Per se respectively. Except for kernel weight, emergence index (EI) and emergence rate index (ERI), grain yield was positively and significantly correlated with yield components and seedling-vigour traits, Vegetative and floweringtraits were not correlated with grain yield.Mid- and high parents heterosis for grain yield ranged from -33.3 to 75.5%	and from -33.3 to 42.9% with averages of 35.6 and 15.7%, respectively. Heterosisfor yield components and vegetative, maturity and flowering traits were lower than values obtained for grainyield. FARZ 7 x TZE4, FARZ 23 x TZE4 and FARZ 27 x FARZ 34 were consistently higher yieding, more vigorous and flowered earlier than their parents. Contrarily FARZ 23 x FARZ 7 was lower yielding, less vigorous and matured earlier than the parents. The yield advantage of hybrids over parents resulted from a larger sink size as indicated by significant increases in ear length and diameter, kernel depth and row number, cob diameter and ear number.General combining ability (GCA), a measure of additive effects of genes was significant for grain yield only. Specific combining ability (SCA), a measure of non-additive effects was not significant for any trait. Therefore, lines developed from FARZ 27 and FARZ 26 should demonstrate acceptable GCA for yield.|Theses collection|Heterosis and combining ability for grain yield/yield components and seedling-vigour/vegetative and maturity traits/Maize cultivars*||||||Agbada Patrick Sunday Ojagboha|Male|EXAMINATION OF THE CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS OF TABERNAEMONTANA PACHYSIPHON, ANTIARIS AFRICANA ANDMOSTUEA BRUNONIS||||||M.

Attempts by some of the oil companies to dispense their product in cities by theuse of storage tanks have been attended with a number of problems which stem mainly from the properties ofthe palm oil. To solve these problems some of the properties including the flow characteristics of the palm oil have to be known. Those properties include viscosity; density and apparent cubic expansivity.These properties and the effect of heat on the were studied. The performance of dispensation pump (manuallyoperated semi--rotary pump) was also studied.As expected the results of the experiments showed that rise in temperature leads to decrease in viscosityand specific gravity of the oil. At 25oC the oil has viscosity of 450.38 centipoise and specific gravity ofabout 920.42 while at 50oC the viscosity was 80.42 centipoise and the specific gravity 888.58. It alsoappears that as the solid phase percentage of the oil increases the apparent cubic expansivity increases.Section A (with the lowest percentage) was found to have an apparent cubic expansivity of about 6.09 x 10-4 K-1 while that of sections B, C and D are 6.08, 8.02 and 11.66 x 10-4 K-1 respectively.The performance of the pump evaluated at three different temperature levels 26, 30 and 35C shows that the pump can adequately dispense the palm oil.The flowing rate appears to be a function of temperature within the tested temperature range. The velocity of the oil in the pipeline were 1 5 .1, 17.2 and 26.Ocm/sec at 26o , 30oC and 35oC respectively.|Theses collection|PALM OIL METERING DEVICE/*||||||Afolayan Moradeke|Male|AN INVESTIGATION INTO SOME OF THE DISTRESS MECHANISMS OF NIGERIAN HIGHWAY PAVEMENTS : A CASE STUDY OF IBADAN IFE ROAD||||||M.

Ibadan - Ife road is a typical case-study where numerous road failures have occured after a few years of in-service conditions.An explanation of the causes of failure had been sought in terms of the geotechnical properties of the soil, local, environmental conditions, morphology traffic level and pavement thickness, using field and laboratory studies.Laboratory soil tests reveal that the natural water content of the soils increases from the driest period of the year to wettest period of the year. Almost all the samples fall below A line in the Casagrande's plasticity chart indicating that the materials are mainly inorganic silts and sands with little clay binders. The optimum moisture contents of the samples vary from 13.5% to 30.8%. The maximum dry densities also vary from 1.453g/cm3 to 1 .882g/cm3.The C.B.R values obtained range from poor to good ratings. However, it is shown that C.B.R values should be used with great caution since they do not always reflect the "worst" moisture condition for the subgrade material. The undrained shear strength for the undisturbed materials are higher than those for the compacted materials, probably reflecting the effect of soil structure on shear strength.Although the traffic level had significantly exceeded the design value, the causes of failure has been traced not necessarily to high traffic levelbut to poor surface and subsurface drainage conditions triggered and aggravated by slump materials from associated slope failures in the cut sections. It is shown that if road failures are to be averted equal emphasis must be placed on adequate slope design and protection, adequate surface and subsurface drainage as it is presently placed on adequate structural thickness and good compaction control in the current Nigerian Highway design practice. In addition laboratory results should be properly co-ordinated with field practice.|Theses collection|Morphology, slope failures and road failures/Nigerian Highway design practice/Distress Mechanisms of Nigerian Highway Pavements*||||||Agumanu Azuwuike Ephraim|Male|SEDIMENTARY PETROGRAPHY OF THE KERRI-KERRI FORMATION BAUCHI AND BORNO STATES, NIGERIA||||||M.

The presence of the pollenSpinizonocolpites baculatus, Monocolpites marginatus and the absence of the Neogene volcanic plugs from the sequence suggest a humid, fresh water to near coastal deposits of possible Lower Paleocene to Upper Miocene age.A zonal grouping of zircon breadth-length plots, the broadly defined maxima of elongation frequency curves of the said mineral and the paucity of black zircons suggest an ill-sorted arkosic sandstone derived from several sources. The heavy minerals, kyanite, staurolite, tourmaline, euhedral aircon, rutile, authigenic limonite, abundant alterite4, rounded zircon indicatea derivation from a Basement Complex area associated with volcanic activities and from older sediments.

Acalypha wilkesiana Mull & Arg. (Euphorbiaceae) is a widely cultivated garden plant in Nigeria. It is commonly known as "flower". The leaf juice has been used in traditional medicine as a cure for Impetigo contagiosa. In the present work a chloroform extract of Acalypha wilkesiana leaves was concentrated to dark green syrup which was distilled under reduced pressure to obtain "Acalypha oil". The upper layer of the above oil yielded two sesquiterpenoid compounds. These compounds were obtained by column chromatography followed by preparative thin-layer chromatography. The sesquiterpenoids exhibited some anti-bacterial activity especially towards Staphylococcus aureus - the causative organism implicated in Impetigo. The presence of this class of terpenoids in the genus Acalypha is being reported for the first time. The chemotaxanomic significance of these findings is discussed.The geographically wide spread Eupatorium odoratum Linn. (Compositae) is said to have been accidentally introduced into Nigeria during World War II. It has since then been used in traditional medicine in the treatment of various ailments which include Impetigo contagiosa. For the present investigation the essential oil from the leaves of Eupatorium odoratum was obtained by steam distillation. Analysis of the oil indicates the presence of terpenoids especially D-Limonene, Cadinene, and alpha-Pinene. These compounds seem to have contributed about50% of the constituents of the oil. This oil also possesses some antibacterial activity against S. aureus.

The aim is to determine the causes and failure in small scale establishments in this industry.The result of my study has shown that the industry is mainly dominated by one-man operated concern with few skilled workers and a satellite of apprentices who are often exploited. The exploitation of the labour of the apprentice helps to proliferate entrepreneur-ship in the furniture industry by a process of reaction through the emigration of disgusted men who want to establish their own workshop. The hasty establishments by trainees without adequate business maturity,and ill--equipped, ill-financed and badly managed, some have been doomed to failure, while some others have grown sluggishly.It is observed that majority of the furniture entrepreneurs are raised from humble or poor parental background, and possessing none or low education and nurtured in workshops in which formalised instruction is lacking, some of the furniture makers have emerged with poor professional skill, technical knowledge, less occupational experience that only few observe the precision which construction and engineering practice demand. Some who have bettor educational background, and workshop training, skill, funds, fortuitiously acquired suitable operating business environments, personal initiatives have progressed. Generally, poor workshop accommodation, high rent, lack of industrial facilities, poor management, lack of finance are but few of the problems that pose before the furniture industrialists; the progressive and retarding ones.The furniture industry occupies an important place in small-scale industries in Enugu in particular and in Nigeria in general. Improvement in this sector could be attained by raising the level of education, industrial skill and knowledge, provision of industrial facilities and funds. While better skill can be achieved by making available to the small furniture makers packages of industrial training in existing Industrial Training Centres and Colleges of Technology at a free or moderate costs, greater productivity could be attained in more favourable industrial sites with industrial utilities than the dirty environments or in workshops housed in the streets as were the cases of some of the furniture establishments observed.

The fluid (blood) is assumed incompressible and Newtonian and the wavelength of the generated wave is longer than the tube dimater   (/r > 1000, where r is the tube radius, h the wavelength)[13]. The flow velocity is small compared with the wave velocity[4,20]. The one-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation isused to consider inviscid flow in a uniform impermeable tube by the method of characteristics to obtain simple - wave solutions indicating time and the position where shock begins to form.In addition, a viscous flow in a tapered branching tube is considered. The efflux or fluid outflow per unit length of tube is accounted for by the function(p [2,4, 18] introdued into the continuity equation and its specific form later chosen in line with Skalak's condition [4](edited). The wavefront expansion is used to obtain an ordinary differential equation in the pressure gradient, p1, which is in the form of Riccati equation. Then circumstances under which shock may form, the time and distance this may occur are investigated for different flows using the ordinary differential equation.

These lateritic soils are used to a great extent for the mud-wall houses and road basements. Also burnt bricks were produced in Ife but are no more used as building materials any longer.The present investigation revealed the availability of other building materials mainly sand, gravels and rock aggregates which are all put into use in building houses and road construction. For foundation purposes the project area was found to be generally stable with permissible soil pressure up to and over 200 KN/m2, Landslides and other related phenomena were not observed. The soil material is generally stable.An hydrogeological mapping of Ife was carried out and it was found that the area has a potentiality for ground-water development.Light cone penetration test results have shown that the consistency of the soil at the time when the testswere carried out were semi-hard to hard and in some parts.The thickness of the overburden is between 0.5 m. and 9.0 m.Soil samples from four different selected areas of the town were tested in the laboratory. It was found that the grain sizes of the tested soil samples were uniformly distributed within the sand-sandy silt range and the amounts of fines were generally low (10%). Plasticity indices of thespecimens range from 2.7% to 19.4% Three consolidation tests were carried out on so-called ndisturbed samples. The test results can be interpreted that the soil show minor settlement. Two sets of direct shear tests were carried out. One disturbed sample was tested nearly vertical to the foliations, It showed that the undisturbed material has high cohesion (42) and angle of internal friction whereas the undisturbed sample shows reduced cohesion (42) but a higher angle of internal friction (46).From these test results it could be concluded that the material is very stable when subjected to additional loads, For big projects, particularly those that are to cover large areas and exert great pressures on the soil, a comprehensive subsurface investigation (including geophysical investigation) is recommended in order to avoid differential settlements as well as ground failure. The stability of steep and high slope should be proved before the earth works start.|Theses collection|soil material/lateritic soils/soil type in Ife area*||||||Ademua Michael Alao|Male|ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN OIL PALM PLANTATION PRACTICE: THE COWAN ESTATE EXPERIENCE 1972-75||||||M.

While some people feel that the most effective approach is at the rural level through a rehabilitation scheme of the natural palm groves, others believe that the best way-out is to evolve a vigorous plantation system for the crop. The protagonists of the second school of thought constantly point to the Malaysian experience in plantation practice through which production of this crop has progressed by leaps and bounds since 1939 and enabled those countries to supplant the Nigerian position as a leading world exporter of palm oil.The present study covering 1972-75 provides empirical evidence based on an exist-1g oil palm estate - Cowan Estate in Bendel State - to confirm or refute the view that an oil palm plantation can be operated on a profit basis in anylocality in Nigeria where favourable climatic and ecological conditions are available. Within the serious limitations imposed by the use of data from a secondary source, the problems of cost allocations between the estate and otherfarms which are operated under the same organization, and the seniscence of palms in the estate, the author employed three analytical techniques in the investigation, These techniques comprised the Gross Margin Analysis and the Internal Rate of Return for investigating the issue of financial profitability, and regression analysis for identifying the various resource factors that mostly influence profitability. The Gross Margin Analysis at current prices indicated a positive but fluctuating annual gross margins for the four year period under study; but when the technique was repeated under constant prices, an annual gross margin that steadily declined from year to year and actually became negative in the last two years was obtained. The Internal Rate of Return based on a salvage price of N300,000 which the Bendel State Government paid for the estate gave a high figure of 57% which could not be validated, and which in fact, fell to a low rate of 4.6% when the estimated low true economicinvestment value of the farm was used. Lastly, the Regression analysis on resource productivities revealed that the estate was operating at diminishing returns at the farm level but at increasing returns at the mill level, As operations at both levels fell within the "irrational stages"(stages III and I respectively) of economic theory, a further examination of the MVP/MFC ratios of the individual resource factors indicated that insufficient labour is being used at the farm level while the mill requires to be worked to greater capacity, both labour and capital-wise.The findings obtained through the Gross Margin Analysis show the distorting effect of instability of price on productivity. For the estate it was clear that the present profit earnings are more a function of inflationary prices than that of efficiency in resource-use, and the policy implication here is that management should cut its operational costs in order to enhance profitability. In the case of the findings that emerged from the application of IRR technique, the government investment decision in paying only a salvage value for a farm that has doubtful profitability prospects is justified. Lastly, the Regression Analysis elicited valuable findings for locating two operational centres at the estate and identifying areas in each case where more costs could be incurred in order to optimise profit, or where costs should be reduced in order to achieve an optimal profit goal. In total, there is no doubt that Cowan Estate can pay its way if resource factorsare properly managed. Thus if a plantation with very old trees like Cowan can hold out such hopes, there are bright profit prospects for oil palm plantations in Nigeria.|Theses collection|Oil Palm industry/Nigerian Oil Palm industry/oil plantation practice*||||||Adeniyi Funso|Male|STUDIES OF THE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL FACTORS AND THE PLANKTONIC ALGAE OF LAKE KAINJI, NIGERIA||||||PhD.

The studies were carried out from January 1973 to September 1975 at eigth sampling stations chosen to represent the entire lake.Sampling programme and techniques were designed such that spatiotemporal variations in the factors might be revealed. The basic physical factors that were investigated included water temperature, transparency, turbidity, colour, wind-generated waves and sunshine duration. The data thus obtained were analysed to provide information on the thermal propertiesof the lake including its mixing/stratification patterns, stability, heat budgets and eddy conductivity; its optical properties of radiation terms, light-climate spectral composition and variations; and its hydromechanical factors including seiches, wave dimensionless functions and set-up.About twenty chemical factors including dissolved gases, nutritional salts, alkali metals, total and bicarbonate hardness, conductivity, hydrogen ion concentration, Biochemical Oxygen Demand and Organic matter were studied.In addition to the studies of the photosynthetic pigments and the taxonomy of the planktonic algae, data and information on the climate of the lake area and the hydrology of the lake itself were also obtained.Results showed that the physical limnology of the lake is determined or influenced mainly by its latitudinal position and hydrology. The lake i a warm monomictic type with high tropicality index, stability and annual amplitude of temperature variation but low light penetration characteristics .Although its wind and wave properties agreed, within limits, with the Sverdrup-Munk (1941) curves and models by the U.S. Army (1962) for large lakes and Oceans, actual wave conditions were uncorrespondingly low as borned out by the low significant wave-height observed .The lake is poor in chemical nutrients, and belongs both to the bicarbonate group of oligotrophic waters and class I of African waters according to Tailing and Tailing (1965) . Apart from having a relatively high proportion of magnesium, its stoichiometry and general properties are those typical of African waters .A systematic account including checklists and illustrated keys were provided on the algal flora which constisted  of about 360 taxa of 305 species, 98 genera, 35 families and five divisions.Algal standing crop was so high that it produced self-shading effect on light penetration and on the horizontal extent of the photosynthesis-depth profile thus giving low values of both e s (i.e .

Recent research has shown that P diffuses through the soil to the plant root, so that a kinetic approach may improve the accuracy of measuring available P.In the present study, the relationships between P adsorption isotherms, P diffusion rate in soil, soil solution P concentration, plant root length, plant age, P uptake, and dry matter yield in the greenhouse, were investigated in five Indiana soils, using millet (Panicum milaceum) as the test crop. P uptake characteristics of millet were determined in solution culture at different ages. Using a mathematical model, P uptake was computed from the measured P properties of the soil, and the plant root characteristics; root-hair effect was not considered in the model. The result was compared with the observed P uptake in the greenhouse.The observed P uptake and P uptake rates in the greenhouse were much greater than the uptake and uptake rates computed for hair-less roots. Hence, the significance of root-hairs to P availability insoil was evaluated from observations on the root-hair cylinder volume.For a 10 day uptake period, P uptake from soil had much better correlation with total available P in the soil (r = 0.94) than withsoil solution P concentration (r = 0.68) or P diffusion rate (r = 0.4). However, as the P uptake time was increased to 17 days, the correlation with available P became poorer, while the correlation with each of the solution P and P diffusion rate improved significantly. P uptake from soil was directly related to root length, linearly during the earlier uptake periods (10 days), and curvilinearly later. Also, most of the available P within the root-hair cylinder in soil was available to the root for absorption within a few days. Hence, the high correlation between P uptake and the available P during the first 10 days of uptake, during which time the P diffusion rate was not a limiting factor of P availability to the root surface. This would explain the good correlation often obtained between P uptake and Bray P in soil. For a considerably extended uptake period however (17 days), P diffusion rate from the bulk soil to root surface became a significant limiting factor of P availability because P has had enough time to move to the root surface from considerable distance in the bulk soil, and because the available P within root-hair cylinder of the older segment of the root has been largely depleted. Because of the delayed influence of P diffusion rate on P availability to root surface, P buffering capacity of the soil also had no significant relationship with P uptake up to 14 days, but did have a good correlation when uptake period increased to 17 days.|Theses collection|plant root/kinetic process*||||||Adesanya Saburi Adejimi|Male|THE BIOLOGICAL STANDARDISATION OF THE ROOT OF SOME ZANTHOXYLUM SPECIES (FAGARA SPP.)

The samples were from the following wells: Oben-1 (13 samples), Sapele-1 (10), Jones Creek- 1 (12), Benisede-1 (7) and Nembe Creek-1 (15). Standard organic geochemical methods were utilized. These include: Total organic carbon (TOC) determination, bitumen extraction and fractionation, gas chromatographic analysis of n-alkanes and kerogen analysis by acid treatment, density separation and microscopy.TOC ranges from 0.86-2.87% in Oben-1; 1.52-5.03% in Sapele-1; 0.76-1.85% in Jones Creek-1; 0.68-1.72% in Benisede-1 and 0.74- 1.38% in Nembe Creek-1 well . Total bitumen extract (SOM) and saturated hydrocarbon yields (SHC) range respectively from 1736- 3976ppm and 488-1842ppm in Oben-1; 1759-3298ppm and 304-1241ppm in Sapele-1; 1345-2487ppm and 469-954ppm in Jones Creek-1; 639- 3421ppm and 284-1287ppm in Benisede-1; 1107-2815ppm and 300- 676ppm in Nembe Creek-1 well . These resultsshow that the shales contain adequate concentrations of organic matter for source rocks. Comparatively, Oben-1 and Sapele-1 shales have much higher yields and are rich in organic matter while Jones Creek-1, Benisede-1 and Nembe Creek-1 samples contain average to good concentrations.Organic petrography shows that on the average; amorphous, herbaceous, woody and coaly organic matter respectively constitute 55%, 25%, 16% and 4% of kerogens in Oben-1 shales; 52%, 25%, 18% and 5% in Sapele-1; 53%, 26%, 18% and 3% in Jones Creek-1; 44%, 26%, 25% and 5% in Benisede-1; and 43%, 33%, 21% and 3% in Nembe Creek-1 shales. These, along with bitumen geochemical ratios, indicate that Oben-1, Sapele-1 and Jones Creek-1 shales contain humic (type III) kerogens with appreciable admixture of type II kerogens. They originate from terrestrial and mixed (transitional) environments.' Benisede-1 and Nembe Creek-1 shales however, contain predominantly type III kerogens with minor amounts of type II. This suggests that they originate mainly from terrestrial environment.Vitrinite reflectance values range from 0.43-0.60%, 0.40-0.63%,	0.40-0.50%,	0.37-0.46%	and	0.42-0.61%respectively in Oben-1, Sapele-1, Jones Creek-1, Benisede-1 and Nembe Creek-1 wells. These and thermal alteration index values indicate that maturity commences at about 2637m (8650ft) in Oben-1 well; 2981m (9780ft) in Sapele-1 well and 3237m (10620ft) in Nembe Creek-1 well. In Benisede-1 and Jones Creek-1 wells, the source rocks are immature in the studied horizons. Generally, depth to mature zones appears to increase southwards in the Delta.Based on a qualitative evaluation, Oben-1, Sapele-1 and Jones Creek-1 source rocks have moderate to good potentials to generate commercial quantities of oil and gas while Benisede-1 and Nembe Creek-1 source rocks are mainly gas prone. The observed variations in the source rock characteristics are attributable to the heterogenous nature of the organic matter and to variations in the depositional environments.|Theses collection|SOURCE ROCK STUDY/onshore wells*||||||Akinnusi Samuel Olatunde|Male|TEACHING RESOURCES FOR ENGLISH STUDIES IN SELECTED COLLEGES OF EDUCATION IN OYO AND OGUN STATES OF NIGERIA||||||M.

Contemporary education, it has been contended, quite often fails to adequately prepare the youth for the challenges of life.A major contributory factor to this phenomenon in Nigeria is inadequate competence in the English language, the language of instruction and learning. People have indeed talked, and not without some justification, of a decline in the standard of performance in English among Nigerian children. Empirical evidence has been adduced and statistics regarding the failure rate in the WASCE provided to justify such a claim.	What remains to be done is to diagnose on a fairly scientific basis, the causes of the unsatisfactory level of competence in the English language. This is what this study has attempted to do, at least in part.Without the desired input, nothing can be produced. For competence in English to be possible, needed resources, human and material, must be made available for teaching and learning the subject. That is why this study has focussed on teaching resources for English at the college of education level, in the belief that a good training for our teachers, coupled with the right motivation, would help to improve the standard of teaching and learning the English language in our schools.Generally, the study revealed that lecturers' in English were in inadequate supply in the colleges covered. Those that were available were not being put to maximum use for the reasons highlighted. The recommendations made at the end of the study are aimed at improving the situation.|Theses collection|educational expectations and actual educational attainment/competence in the English language/the language of instruction and learning/standard of performance in English*||||||Akinola Olugbemiga Marcus|Male|A LINGUISTIC-STYLISTIC APPROACH TO THE TEACHING OF POETRY IN THE SENIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL||||||M.

Besides, some vital information might even be missing from some of the records since students fill so manyforms in so many places and these forms are kept in various files which because of their volume, could very easilybe mishandled. Also, some of the people involved find the computations required in the presentation of results under the Course-Unit System rather difficult. Since these computations are done manually, they are definitely prone to errors, some of which might be difficult to detect.This project seeks to eliminates these inadequacies by proposing a centralized, Computer-based data-bank of Students' academic records along with procedures for maintaining and updating this data-bank.

By the same token, careful and efficient management of those assets not only reducethe likelihood of business failure but also makes a positive contribution to the firm's profit position. It is imperative therefore, to give careful consideration to business investments in working Capital components.With these in mind, it is the objective of this work: (a) To look at how a footwear manufacturing company manages its stocks, debtors and cash;To find out whether these are areas of deviation or conformity when the practice in the company (what is) is related to the theoritical back-ground (what -should be) ;(c)	To identify the causes, if any and finally;(d)	To make recommendations.At the end of the research, a number of findings were made. The Company's Production Manager, Sales Manager and the Chief Accountant have the joint responsibility for managing the Company's Working Capital, but report to the General Manager.In the Production department, production was often disrupted due to the inavailability of raw materials caused by the delay in processing Central Bank of Nigeria' s 'Form M'. It was also observed that efforts towards collection of debts became lax in the year 1977/78. The Accounting department manages the firm's cash efficiently, though it has no sophisticated cash management system such as the cash budget.However, the findings are set out more comprehensively in Chapter Five.|Theses collection|WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT /A FOOTWEAR MANUFACTURING COMPANY/causes of financial distress /small firms*||||||Akhideno Elizabeth Akomen|Female|SUPERVISORY PRACTICES IN SECONDARY GRAMMAR SCHOOLS IN BENIN CITY||||||M.

It was also hypothesized that there would be relationships between the personal variables of the respondents and their performances.Models of expected functions and questionnaire forms were designed for each of the categories of respondents, After apanel of nine judges read and validated the instrument and a pilot study was taken in four divisional board areas in the Midwest, the instrument was used to collect data from inspectors, principals, departmental heads and teachers in Benin City. Observations and interviews were also used.The collected data were marked and 0, 1, 2, 3 marks were awarded respectively for functions not performed at all, those poorly performed, those averagely performed, and those excellently performed and recorded in percentages.The methods of analysis used were:(i)	finding the norm for each group of supervisors;(ii)	using the t test of significance; and.(iii)	utilizing simple correlation technique to examine the collected data.(i)	The following findings were made as a result of the analyses:1.	The group norms for the inspectors, principals, departmental heads and teachers were 35%, 41%, 36.7% and 40.3% respectively.2.	More of the inspectors (60%), principals (60%), and departmental heads (54.6%) performed better than the average mean score of their respective groups while more teachers (53.7%) performed below their group average.3.	That principals with a mean score of 41% and teachers with a mean score of 40.3% performed their supervisory duties more than the departmental heads and inspectors whose mean scores were 36.7% and 35% respectively.4.	That all the groups of supervisors had less than 50% which is half the ideal expected of them.5.	That many of the expected functions for all the groups of supervisors were either not performed or poorly performed,6.	It was only in one school that the writer observed keen supervision of both staff and students by the principal.7.	Supervision of instruction at the secondary school level in Benin City, Midwestern State was in general, inadequately performed and this inadequacy could be attributed to such factors as inadedequate qualification of employees, their size of responsibility, poor attitude to work, nonimplementation of recommendations, limited authority on	the part of respondents, distance from school,disciplinary problems in the schools and lack of inducement and incentives for the teachers.8. The personal variables of respondents which had significant relationships with their supervisory performances were experience in the case of the inspectors; sex and academic qualification in the ease of the departmental heads; and sex in the case of the teachers.The writer made the following recommendations arising from the investigation:(i)	organization of seminar courses and workshops every year for inspectors, principals, departmental heads and teachers to create awareness in them of their supervisory roles;(ii)	giving the proper training and orientation for anybody who wishes to teach;(iii)	a widening of the present powers of inspectors to include the authority to carry out their recommendations and those of the principals to include recruitment and control of teachers as well as better control of students ;(iv)	the need for this study to be replicated in other divisional education board areas in the Midwestern State, or other States of the Federation, as well as on other levels of education;(i)	(v)	the great need for research to be carried out on the magnitude of the problems inspectors, principals, departmental heads and teachers run into in trying to carry out instructional supervision; and(vi)	the worthwhileness in investigating how the quality of instructional supervision affects students' learning performances.|Theses collection|SUPERVISORY PRACTICES*||||||Akinbode Isaac A.|Male|AN ANALYSIS OF INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH, TEACHING AND EXTENSION IN WESTERN NIGERIA||||||Ph.D. Cooperative Extension (administration)|Robert C.

This reorganization raised several questions such as:(1)	Should the Institute be an integral part of the StateUniversity Faculty of Agriculture?(2)	Should it be a separate unit in the University on equal basis with the Faculty?(3)	Should it be a complete autonomous organization outside of the University and the Ministry?(4)	How should its activities be coordinated with those of related agencies?The solution adopted by the State government was to accept the second alternative referred to above. The Institute was given theresponsibility of coordinating its own activities with those of the State University Faculty of Agriculture and the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources.MethodThe data were collected from staff members of the Institute, Faculty and Ministry described above, using questionnaires and personally conducted interviews. A review of official records and documents provided additional information on organizational policies and procedures. The data were analyzed through descriptive statistics such as percentages, medians, and chi-square.FindingsA limited number and degree of cooperative relationships were reported in research, teaching and extension related activities. A greater number and extent of competition and conflicts developed over personnel, appropriation of state funds and materials, and jurisdiction over agricultural research and instruction. Most of the cooperative efforts reported among the organizations occurred prior to the transfer of the research and training functions of the Ministry to the University; whereas competition and conflicts became apparent with the advent of this reorganization.Three factors appeared to be most influential in the kind of relationships found among the agencies. These included: (1) the quality of organizational leadership, (2) centralization of decision making, and (3) utilization of individual as contrasted to team performance as criterion for staff evaluation and reward. Otherfactors that showed relationships with interorganizational acts were (1) length of service, (2) official status, (3) benefits to individual participants, and (4) the extent to which agency members perceived each other favorably.RecommendationsIt was recommended that the organizational leaders and policy makers take actions to:1.	Minimize disagreements among the agencies by substituting conflict situations with a more impersonal problem-solving approach;2.	Encourage team efforts as basis for evaluation and reward through (1) redefinition of roles and criteria for evaluation, and (2) joint appointments;3.	Encourage close contacts among staff members through seminars, conferences etc. and circulation of research reports;4.	Establish a joint committee of the three agencies to disburse funds and supervise joint programs and give it the power for demanding conformance from its member agencies; and5.	Encourage further research into additional organizational and leadership characteristics that might influence inter-organizational relationships.|Theses collection|Agricultural research, teaching and extension in the Western State of Nigeria*||||||Amadi Emmanuel Azunda|Male|THE DEVEL0PMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES IN THE CIVIL SERVICE 	OF THE RIVERS STATE OF NIGERIA                      ||||||MPA Public Administration|R.

Since any secondary organization exists as a subsystem of a larger social system, what affects the larger system, certainly reflects in the units within it. The paucity of executive capacity in the Rivers State Civil Service is traceable to the long-term neglect of the development of the local manpower by the former government of the area. Added to this was the destructive effect of the civil war which considerably damaged the economy of the State. Above all, the State Government embarked upon massive economic development programmes soon after its inception, for the ultimate improvement of the life of the people.The successful implementation of these programmes presupposes an efficient and committed manpower component of the plans, anda management style that could train, motivate and fully utilizethe available personnel. However, investigation proved otherwise. Apart from observed shortage of high-level and skilled manpower, the prevailing pattern of management of available manpower resources was incapable of motivating employees sufficiently to commit themselves fully to the objectives of the organization. Since employee development is meaningfully achieved on the job, to motivate them into bettor job performance would mean involving employees into participation in decision-making about their jobs; compensating them mainly on the basis of performance results; and developing training programme to improve performance.The study, therefore suggests, from a practitioner's standpoint, a technique of work study with a view to creating meaningful workloads or job contents suitable for the available skills, and providing a guide to staffing in future. Finally, in order to the eternalize this process of employee development, the study makes policy recommendations to the effect that a co-ordinated manpower planning programme be stabilized; and the 'management-by-objective' strategy (recommended by the Public Service Review Commission and accepted by Government) be introduced in the State Service.|Theses collection|Human resources/civil service/local manpower/civil service of the Rivers State of Nigeria*||||||Akinboro Latif Olajide|Male|STRUCTURE, CONDUCT, OPERATIONAL AND PRICING EFFICIENCIES OF WHOLESALE MARKETING OF TOMATO IN IBADAN; 1979/80||||||M.

A decision was made to carry out a study on tomato because of its nutritional importance, its neglect in the recent past and its economic potentials. Hence, the objectives of the research were: (1) to identify the relevant cost components in determining the marketing costs of tomato at the whole-sale level; (2) to assess the operational and pricing efficiencies in the Ibadan based tomato wholesale industry; and (3) to suggest ways of improving the industry's efficiency.Unit cost curve synthesis methodology was employed. The--methodology enabled one to determine the total marketing costs and subsequently the unit cost of marketing and the efficiency level of each firm in the industry.Data for the study were provided by the wholesalers of tomato and the institutions on the wholesaler's demand and supply sides.The first null hypothesis that at the Ibadan tomato wholesale subsection, operational efficiency of marketing in 1979 was high was rejected in favour of the first alternative hypothesis that the specified operational efficiency was low.The two firm, four firm and eight firm concentration ratios, CR2, CR4 and CR8, were respectively 9%, 16% and 27%. The Herfindahl index was 0. 008 and the Gini coefficient value was 0. 77. These concentration indexes indicated that the industry in 1979/80 was not concentrated and that there was uneven distribution of market shares among the firms in the industry. There was no evidence of dominant firms, price collusion or predatory pricing among the wholesalers. Evidence of barriers to entry in the industry did not exist. economies of size existed in the industry and medium sized firms were more efficient than either the small or large sized firms.Findings revealed that the mean operational efficiency level was 26%, the standard deviation o. 39% and coefficient of variability 1. 5. The operational efficiency histogram was skeewed to the right. Both the supply and demand sides of the wholesaler's market were faced with some problems which could contribute to low efficiencies.The components of costs for marketing tomato were transportation 49.4%, 29. 7% on equipment, 18.3% on labour and 2. 5% on rent. The average total estimate of the spoilage cost at the industry level in 1979 was N149,100.|Theses collection|Tomato*||||||Akinboye Solomon Oladele|Male|INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND THE LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ||||||M.

The LDCs, since the inception of the Fund under the Brettonwoods agreement of 1944, have been occupying a weak position in the decisionmaking structure of the fund as well as in the sharing of liquidity. The main contention of the LDCs therefore is to ensure that the anomalies are rectified with a view to securing for them a fair deal in the affairs of the fund.This study focuses on the position of the LDCs in the operation of the IMF. It is narrative and analytical; and it identifies and examines in broad perspective various issues within the context of the fund pertaining to the LDCs. Essentially, the essay starts by tracing the evolution of IMP.It then goes on to analyse the structure of the fund showing the position of the LDCs. It later considers the sources and distribution of Fund resources; and concludes by evaluating the Fund and making some policy prescriptions on how the LDCs could be actively involved in the affairs of the Fund.|Theses collection|world monetary system/International Monetary Fund (IMF)*||||||Akindele Ann Modupe|Male|STUDIES ON OGIRI A NIGERIAN FERMENTED MELON SEED CONDIMENT||||||M.

Neither was available P recovered from the soil affected by Mg applied.However, the generally low P recovery observed in this investigation could be attributed partially to the clay content of the soils used and also to the level of Mg as a cation applied in the treatments which could probably give rise to P-Mg complexes.The results of the greenhouse experiment show that plant
height was increased with increasing levels of P with the maximumat 40 ppm P beyond which further P-fertilization depressed tomato plant height. The minus P treatments (control) produced generally poor plant growth. Plant height was improved generally with increasing levels of Mg. Chlorophyll content of the tomato leaves during fruiting tended to decrease with increasing levelsof P with the maximum at 80 ppm P. Beyond the 80 ppm P, flower production was depressed. Stem diameter of tomato plants increased markedly at the first levels of P (i.e. 40 ppm P) but further P-fertilization did not appreciably improve stem diameter. Tomato fruit yield was markedly increased with P-fertilization up to 80 ppm P beyond which yield was depressed.Treatment combinations of 40 ppm P and 80 ppm Mg gave the maximum plant height while flower production, stem diameter and fruit yield were at maximum at 80 ppm P and 40 or 80 ppm Mg.Fruit yield of tomato plants was found to be highly correlated with flower production (r = 0.74) and stem diameter (r = 0.78) but significant negative correlation (r = -0.19) was found between fruit yield and chlorophyll content of the leaves.There was a linear increase in P uptake as P fertilizer application was increased though the leaf-P concentration was generally low at all levels of applied P. There were inverserelationships between leaf-P and leaf-Mg (r = -0.456), leaf-P and leaf-Ca (r = -0.576) but these inverse relationships in the foliage were reversed in the fruit . Plant composition of P and Mg were found, not only to be influenced by the concentrations of other nutrient elements, but also to be dependent on the tomato plant part being -tested.The field trial also confirmed that P-fertilizer levelsof 80 ppm P was adequate for the tomato plant variety used in the experiments.|Theses collection|The role of phosphorus (P) and magnesium (Mg) and their interaction on the fruit yield/Ife Plum tomato plants*||||||Agboola Babatunde Samson|Male|ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON OF TEXTBOOKS FOR MATHEMATICS TEACHING INONDO STATE SECONDARY SCHOOLS ||||||M.

The purpose of the study was to find out how far mathematics textbooks that are used in Ondo State Secondary Schools possess those attributes.The method involved the use of two questionnaires, two rating scales, and the investigator's visits to twelve selected schools in Ondo State. Responses to the first questionnaire showed the textbooks in use for mathematics teaching in Ondo State Secondary Schools. Qualities teachers associate with good texts in the subject were compiled from responses to the second questionnaire. The four most popular textbooks Ondo State Secondary Schools use for mathematics teaching were then analysed and compared. One rating scale measured how adequately the selected texts covered the topical requirements of the West African School Certificate mathematics syllabus while the other measured how far each of the books met other expectations of teachers from textbooks they use for mathematics teaching.The result shows that in terms of coverage of the syllabus requirements, the textbooks examined were satisfactory. However, on considering factors such as approach to topics, use of illustrations, adequacy and illustrativeness of worked example, inclusion of remediation section and enrichment section and availability of pupils' workbooks and teachers' editions, all the textbooks analysed fell short of expectation in one way or the other.On the basis of the findings, the investigator observes that the popularity of use of a textbook among schools may be indicative of the degree of its quality; and recommends:i	The joint use by schools of two of the textbooks analysed since between them they achieve most if the textbooks are considered two at a time.ii Sponsorships by the Federal Government of professional bodies in various subject disciplines for the production of textbooks for use at the secondary school level.iii The employment of the services of competent editors by textbooks publishers to edit textbooks before they are released for public consumption.iv The use of financial grants by the Federal Government to encourage able and promising Nigerian textbook authors. And for a start, some financial backing by the Federal Government for both "Dada and Josiah" and "Onibonoje" series to enable them improve, the quality of their present works.|Theses collection|Mathematics Textbooks/Attributes of Mathematics Textbooks/Attributes of Mathematics Teachers*||||||Agboola Babatunde Samson|Male|DIAGNOSTIC-PRESCRIPTIVE TEACHING OF SECONDARY SCHOOL MATHEMATICS||||||Ph.D. Curriculum Studies|B.

It involved three hundred and seventy Class IV students in twelve secondary schools situated in Akure and Ondo - Ifesowapo Local Government Areas of Ondo State. Two groups of teachers participated in the study: the diagnostic-prescriptive teaching group and the lecture method group. The Pretest-Posttest Control Group Designwas used, and four instruments were employed: an achievement test, an attitude scale, a social distance scale, and a scaleor the analysis of classroom interaction. The study lasted a period of nine weeks during which the researcher monitored the day-to-day performances of the participating teachers.Two of the four hypotheses tested were confirmed: these are Hypothesis 1 which states that learners in a diagnostic-prescriptive teaching (D.P.T.) class perform better in mathematics achievement test than learners in a lecture method (L.M.) class; and Hypothesis 3 which states that learners in a D.P.T. class develop more positive attitude towards mathematics than learners in an L.M. class. The findings of the study did not confirm Hypothesis 2 on retention. With respect to Hypothesis 4, there was someimprovement in the degree of mutual acceptance even though the difference was not significant at the 0.01 probability level,The study recommends that D.P.T. be used by mathematics teachers in Nigerian secondary schools since the approach takes cognizance of the inherent logic of mathematics and the affective needs of learners. Other recommendations of the study include sponsorship of mathematics teachers for D.P.T. training in universities and the use of classroom observation of what the teacher does as the main evaluation technique in teacher training institutions.|Theses collection|Diagnostic prescriptive teaching/mode of instruction in secondary school mathematics*||||||Aghenta Joseph Amiokhe|Male|AN ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF THE TRAINING, EMPLOYMENT AND JOB PERFORMANCE OF VOCATIONAL SCHOOL GRADUATES IN BENDEL STATE OF NIGERIA||||||Ph.

As a result of this, policy makers have always been concerned with the development, training and utilization of skilled manpower.Basically, this study examined the training, employment and job performance of vocational school graduates in Bendel State of Nigeria. The main purpose was to analyse and evaluate the State's vocational school programme in terms of training, employment and job performance. It was based on the hypothesis that there is no difference between the characteristics of manpower produced in Bendel State's vocational schools and those of the manpower required in the State's labour market in terms of training, number, employment and job performance. From this hypothesis, six operational hypotheses were formulated to guide the study.To test the six operational hypotheses, five instruments,Head of Department Questionnaire (HDQ), Principal Questionnaire (PQ), Personnel Manager Questionnaire (PMQ), Graduate Questionnaire (GQ), and Foreman Questionnaire (FQ) were constructed to collect data. The responses obtained through the five instruments were analysed by statistical methods which yielded the following main results:(1)	the level of skills required by employers was significantly higher than the level of skills imparted to students in the State's vocational schools;(2)	the number of graduates trained in the State's vocational schools (1974-1977) was higher than the number of such graduates employed in the State during the same period;(1)	(3)	the number of students enrolled in the State's vocational schools in classes I, II and III in 1978 for exceeded the number of jobs available for vocational school graduates during the 1978-80 forecast period;(4)	differences existed in demand for the different categories of vocational school graduates in the state;(5)	the expected maximum level of job performance was significantly higher than the actual level of job performance by the vocational school graduates in the State; and,(6)	a significant difference existed in job performance among the graduates from the different vocational schools in the State.The findings led to the following conclusions:(a)	that the standard of training in the State vocational schools was low and that the low standard was due mainly to the lack of information from the employers of labour on the standard expected of the graduates in the labour market;(b)	that there was unemployment problem (41 percent) among the vocational school graduates in the State, particularly among graduates in auto-mechanics, electrical trades and telecommunications; and,(c)	that the level of job performance by the vocational school graduates from the State vocational schools was low mainly because of the poor standard of training in the vocational schools.The study concluded that for the vocational training system to be able to contribute to the production of competent skilled manpower so urgently needed in the State, several steps must be taken. The steps include manpower surveys, formulation of government policies, drawing up of plans for implementation, establishment of a State advisory council on vocational education, vocational curriculum development and provision of adequate funds and equipment. Further, the studyemphasized the need for streamlined admission policies and practices, training of technical education teachers and the establishment of industrial training within a legislative frame work. Finally, machinery for placement of graduates in jobs and the provision of in-service training opportunities for the graduates will be found helpful.|Theses collection|The training, employment and job performance of vocational school graduates/Bendel State's Vocational School*||||||Aluko Joyce A.

The qualifications on entry, age, sex, occupation of parents and states of origin are correlated with the students' academic achievement.It is found that:1	The women graduates were younger than the men graduates.2	more of the women than the men graduates came from the elite homes.3	There was a slight increase in the number of graduates from the farming families during the period. But in view of the ratio of the farming to non-fanning population in Nigeria, the relative number from the farming families was still low.The younger students, particularly in the Sciences, tended to obtain better degrees than older students, and students in the Sciences generally obtained better degrees than those in the humanities. The GCE 'A' Level/HSC entry qualification did not highly correlate with the final degrees achieved.From the analysis, certain conclusions are drawn, that though the children of the elite might have initial advantages on entering the university, these advantages do not necessarily persist throughout their university career.In the case of women, the stronger representation of the children of the elite in the university has more to do with the reluctance of parents from farming population to give higher education to their daughters than their inability to finance the cost of education.Although the statistical correlation between entry qualification andfinal degree achievement is weak, performance at GCE 'A' Level/HSC examinations continues to be one of the main criteria for selection of candidates for admission to the universities. Further research on how best to select for admission into the universities is necessary.|Theses collection|social background and entry qualifications/age/ sex/ occupation of parents / states of origin/academicachievement*||||||Adebiyi Abdul-Rabb Ajao|Male||||||||||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,||||OAU||||||||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

There are four chapters, with a brief summary and conclusion.The first chapter contains the colonial and constitutional history of Rhodesia until the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) by Mr. Ian Smith on November 11, 1965.Chapter two deals with the response of the Common-wealth to the unilateral declaration of independence. Emphasis is placed on Commonwealth conferences and communiques.Chapter three focusses attention on African guerrilla warfare as a means of forcing the white minority in Rhodesia to renounce UDI and move towards majority African rule. It also examines extra-Commonwealth initiatives aimed at negotiated settlement. These include the Kissinger Plan and the Anglo-American Peace Proposals. Finally it examines the Commonwealth Lusaka Conference of August 79, which provided the proposals that eventually led to settlement.The fourth Chapter addresses itself to the analysis of the Lancaster House Constitutional Conference; the input of the Commonwealth to that conference and to the 1980 general elections that produced independence under majority rule.The final section is the summary and conclusion. It is a resume of Commonwealth efforts before and after UDI and a speculation on what could be Common-wealth role in future political developments within member States.|Theses collection|Rhodesia independence/Rhodesian decolonization process/the Commonwealth*||||||Atolagbe Folagboye Patrick|Male||||||||||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,||||OAU||||||||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

This practice has continued long after the independence of these former territories.This dissertation focuses on the interests of France in francophone Black African, her military presence in the sub-region, and the use of this coercive element of national power to realize her national objectives. The dissertation highlights the strategic, political and economic interests of France. It also discusses the genesis, composition, orientation and use of French forces in the sub-region. African attitudes to these French factors are also discussed.The study concludes that in the absence of some crisis in France or in Europe; and/or some radical changes in Francophone politics in the sub-region, France will continue to interfere with and intervene in African politics in the foreseeable future.|Theses collection|interests of France in francophone Black African*||||||Adesina Sylvester Adesegun|Male|AN ANALYSIS OP NIGERIA'S EDUCATIONAL PLANS AND ACTUAL EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BETWEEN 1945 and 1970

Specifically, the study intended first to investigate the extent to which there has been a variance between stated quantitative goals and actual educational development in Nigeria; and second, to explore factors that made for the variance between educational plans and actual educational development,The methodology consisted of three major steps. First the researcher examined Nigeria's educational plans since 1945 and identified their quantitative goals and the priorities stressed. Second, Nigeria's actual educational development was analysed and the degree to which quantitative objectives and priorities indicated in the plans conformed or varied with the actual educational development wasdetermined and compared. Finally, using governmental and non-governmental reports, and research in the social sciences which deal with problems relevant to the Nigerian experience, the reasons for discrepancies between educational plans and actual educational development were explored and discussed.The examination of the planned and actual quantitative development showed that first, the quantitative targets set forth in the plans have not been achieved, and second, that the orders of priority implicit in the verbal statements of the plans have in fact been inverted during the process of implementation. There was glaring overspending in the area of primary education which was also acclaimed top priority during the process of implementation contradicting the conditions set for such development in the plans. With primary education consuming a huge proportion of the education funds, the achievement of actual priorities in other areas was already hampered. The areas that suffered most, upper secondary and teacher education, are the areas identified as priorities in the plans. Higher education, not considered a top priority in the plans, also came to the forefront during the process of implementation and combined with primary education to eclipse the much acclaimed intermediate education as represented by upper secondary and middle-level teacher education. In all the levels of education, large-scale quantitative short falls were indicated.In seeking an explanation to this phenomenon in Nigeria'seducational planning experience, certain conditions conventionally associated with the success of educational plans were identified. For a plan to succeed in achieving the priorities and quantitative targets it sets for itself, one or more of the following conditions must be present:1.	The political conditions in the planning country must be, by common judgement, conducive to smooth and unhampered implementation.2.	The technical and political aspects of the plan should be clearly determined and the fusion of the two is avoided.3.	The financial resources for sustaining the plan must be adequate or based on realistic and definite expectations.4.	An implementation machinery exists or a formal implementation machinery is legally or officially recognized.5.	The statistics upon which the plan is developed are reliable and capable of producing desired results.It was shown that the variance between educational plans and what actually happened, and the non-realization of the quantitative goals ofthe plans resulted largely from Nigeria's failure to meet these conditions.|Theses collection|Nigeria's educational achievement between 1945 and 1970/projections in educational plans/stated quantitative goals and actual educational development in Nigeria/factors that made for the variance between educational plans and actual educational development*||||||Yakubu Henrietta M.|Male|UNITED STATES/CHILEAN RELATIONS: THE DYNAMICS OF DEPENDENCY||||||M.

In each of these areas, the elements of Igbo history and culture are presented in parallel sequence with the elements of Yoruba history and culture. An interface concludes each of these matched presentations. The interface points out some of the commonality and differences in the two cultures.It is an interdisciplinary study in scope based on both literary and historical sources. The literary sources are for the Igbos, the novels of Chinua Achebe; for the Yorubas, the plays and the novel of Wole Soyinka. The historical sources are, wherever available, the writings of Nigerian historians. These have been supplemented by thestudies of British and American historians. The study is organized by topics traditional in the social sciences and in anthropology. The topics treated are: political history, economic development, religion, family life, and leadership roles. A final chapter reviews Igbo and Yoruba traditional ways of educating their youth and suggests the place of intercultural studies in modern Nigeria's high schools and universities.It presents in coherent sequence and in expositive form five aspects of Igbo and Yoruba culture, aspects which are referred to passim in the narrative of Achebe and the drama and narrative of Soyinka.

This hypothesis is examined throughout the study, but more specifically in Chapter Four where it is sought to be verified through the cases analysed.The major findings of this study include the following:(a) the decision-making process at Ibadan hasbeen largely modelled on the British provincial university system which relies heavily on collective decision-making in committees or boards;b) the power of the Visitor to the university grew considerably from 1966 onwards, and such power was used from time to time as the need arose.(c)	the incidence of violent student unrest resulted always in the externalisation of purely internal university issues which in turn provided the justification for Government's intervention;(d)	the Government has strengthened its control over university affairs through such central agencies as the National Universities Commission (NUC) and the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB);(e)	from 1974 onwards, the University has come to depend almost totally on subventions from the Government. This has consequently motivated the latter to exert more or less absolute control over every aspect of university life;(f)	the internal decision-making process through the committee system has continued all the time; it has survived mainly because the majority of academics seemed to believe in its inherent virtues. This belief is based upon the rationality of the process through discussion, and its democratic nature.This study follows a general plan, It begins by discussing the university as a formally organised institution within the context of the theory and practice of the decision-making process. Individual, and collective decision-making theory is generally discussed,while university decision-making is examined in some detail. Then, the structure and processes in the University of Ibadan are critically analysed and the symbiotic relationship between the Government and the University is described, using the systems concept to illustrate the nature of such a relationship. There-after, some specific cases are analysed in order to show that the Government exercised direct control over the university from time to time and was actively influencing the internal university decision-making process.The conclusion to the study is in two parts: the first part briefly discusses the findings of a questionnaire designed to elicit opinion amongst those who have participated in formulating and implementing collective decisions at Ibadan. It was found that the majority believe in the committee system as a democratic method of taking collective decisions in spite of the constant threat of external interference. The second part discusses ways and means of restoring university autonomy, and of improving the relations between the Governmentand the university. These include a review of the powers of the Visitor or the abolition of the post; a review of the powers and functions of the NUC; a re-examination of the provisions of the JAMB. The reality of student power oughtto be acknowledged and such energies should be channelled to productive purposes by deliberately encouraging participation in policy matters at the appropriate levels. Moreover, intra-elite conflict must be minimised; the university must be more efficient and effective in its internal management, and a way should be found of detaching the universities from the public service.|Theses collection|decision-making process/University of Ibadan*||||||Akpabio Kingsley Essien|Male|EFFECT OF SOME CHEMICAL MUTAGENS ON THE MEIOTIC CHROMOSOMES OF ZONOCERUS VARIEGATUS LINN.

These were fed on vegetables until they moulted into adults. The adult insects were fed with varying concentrations of EMS, MH and KCN in Drosophila media. Each concentration of each chemical was also given time variation ranging from one day to five days. Testes were extracted from males 24 hours after the end of each treatment and studied cytologically.The mutagens were observed to induce Chromosomal aberrations at various levels and also impair meiotic processes. Aberrations observed include fragmentation, clumping and nonpairing at pachynema, diplonema and diakinesis; clumping and multiple association at first metaphase, lagging and dicentric bridges at Anaphase I. It was also noticed that in their action the mutagens have a delayed effect of about 24 hours.Further work is needed to determine the effect of these aberrations on the reproductive potentiality of the pest (egg batchability for instance). When this is done, preliminary experiments on the efficiency of SIRM may be carried out, whereby a large number of insects are subjected to specific treatments and then released into the natural population, thus building considerable genetic load into the natural population.|Theses collection|CHEMICAL MUTAGENS/CHROMOSOMES/ZONOCERUS VARIEGATUS LINN.*||||||Akpokodje Enuvie Godwin|Male|THE EFFECT OF MOISTURE CONTENT ON THE COMPACTION AND SHEAR STRENGTH

The study is based entirely on geotechnical laboratory tests, using disturbed and compacted samples.Results are considered in terms of their ranges and averages. Explanatory interpretations of results are based on the grain size composition of the soil.The soil is a well graded gravelly, silty lateritic sand. Most of the geotechnical properties vary with depth. It has an inorganic clay component and the consistency is between low and intermediate plasticity. The average maximum dry densityand optimum moisture content are 1.68 g/cm3 and 15.63 respectively. Average unconfined compression strength and C.B.R. at maximum dry density and optimum moisture content are 6.23 kg/cm2 and 44 .06% respectively. Permeability varies from 10-3 to 10-5, cm/sec, depending on the degree of compaction.The results show that the geotechnical properties and behaviour of the compacted samples are largely dependent on the compaction moisture content. The material is considered partially suitable for an earth dam construction.|Theses collection|Soil materials/Opa Dam*||||||Oduaran Akpovire Bovadjera |Male|ADULT WORKERS' ON-THE-JOB TRAINING IN BOTTLING FACTORIES IN BENDEL STATE OF NIGERIA||||||M.

One of the approaches aimed at achieving that objective has been by way of researching into how teaching and learning on the job could be enhanced.Basically, therefore, this study sought to examine the positional and psychological factors affecting trainee-operators and trainers' participation in on-the-job training, and determine the extent to which this also affect productivity and efficiency in bottling factories.Seven hypotheses derived from the review of literature were generated. To test them, six instruments were used in collecting data from a sample of three hundred subjects.The statistical analysis of data at .05 level of significance yielded the following main results:(1)	Age and length of service were not significantly related to trainee-operators' participation in on-the-job training;(2)	Educational background was significantly related to trainee-operators' participation in on-the-job training;(3)	Combination of duties and teaching background were significantly related to operator-trainers' participation in on-the-job training;(4)	Academic motivation and personal adjustment were significantly related to traine-operators participation in on-the-job training;(5)	'Future security was not significantly related to trainee-operators' at participation in on-the-job training; and(6)	On-the-job training was significantly related to increased productivity and efficiency.Based on these findings, some conclusions were drawn up to improve upon and enhance on-the-job training functions in bottling factories.|Theses collection|human capital formation/on-the-job training*||||||Ako-nai Ronke Iyabowale|Female|NIGERIA'S AID TO OTHER AFRICAN STATESTHE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES, PROBLEMS AND FORMS OF AID||||||M.

With the increase in her resources noticeably oil, and the nature of international politics, she has become more involved in thrusting herself to a leadership role in Africa for economic, political and social reasons.There is a limitation to aid she can give due to a number of factors such as political instability which does not allow for continuity, military strength, and the economic position of the country. Although Nigeria is regarded as a rich country in Africa, her economy is such that she requires a lot of capital aid to maintain the population of about 80 million people. Ideological commitment is also one of the constraints. Apart from her own limitations, the Eastern and Western powers are well equipped to shape things in the world. They both possess the overwhelming economic, military and ideological tools to change things and this is what is being witnessed in the world today.|Theses collection|Nigeria's aid programme*||||||Akomolafe Oluwole|Male||||||||||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,||||OAU||||||||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

It was observed that the average participation in the pre-tender functions indicated that the head office management was responsible for 77%, site management 23% and site workforce had no participation at all. On the sites where the site management were involved in the pre-tender functions, reduction in the interruption of construction operations and high performance were observed. It was also observed that clients only allowed little time for tendering functions.Emanating from the findings, it was suggested that the site management be involved in construction planning functions at the pre-tender stage. The construction planning at this stage, for a realistic cost estimate and realiable expected production performance on siteshould include some of the following: work programme which should be used to anticipate potential delays and pre-planning of construction activities to determine optimum construction method.

The organism also produced enzymes with polygalacturonase, pectin transeliminase and pectin methylesterase activity when grown in liquid culture media containing pectic substances as sole carbon sources. The enzymes were also present in infected cocoa bean tissues.Production of cellulase and pectinase enzymes by P. variabile was optimum at 30C. Optimum pH for cellulase and polygalacturonase activity was 5.0 while pectin methylesterase and pectin transeliminase activities were best at pH 8.0. When the cultures were agitated, less cellulase and pectinase enzymes were produced than when the cultures were stationary. Production of cellulase and pectin methylesterase appeared, at least in part, to be constitutive, while polygalacturonase and pectin transeliminase were inducible.The cellulase enzyme complex was separated by molecular exclusion into five components while the pectinase complex was separated by molecular exclusion, followed by ion exchange chromatography into four components.|Theses collection|Cellulolytic and pectinolytic enzyme system/penicillium variabile*||||||Akinwale Shola|Male|AN ALTERNATING DIRECTION IMPLICIT METHOD OF SOLVING ELLIPTIC PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS||||||M.

These included the coastal area of Ondo state which is directly underlain by the Benin formation of Miocene to Plio-Pleistocene age; the Odogbolu area; which is underlain by the Abeokuta formation of Cretaceous age; and the Ife area, underlain by the Precambrian Basement Complex of Nigeria.Geoelectric sounding was used in all three areas, with restricted application of shallow seismic refraction in the Basement Complex area.The interpretation of the geophysical data has been carried out using both computer based techniques and manual methods, to show in more detail the subsurface geology of these areas, with emphasis on groundwater accumulation.Geoelectric results obtained for the coastal part of Ondo state show continuous systems of confined and unconfined aquifers of varying characteristics. The Okitipupa section was revealed as most favourable for groundwater development, followed by the areas around Ilutitun and ten Irele. Computed values of aquifer transmissivity, permeability and yield being highihest around 0kitipupa, and least around Irele, suggesting that, the sediments around 0kitipupa/ Ilutitun/Ode-Aye areas are coarser than those of the Irele environment.Probable subsidence and faulting; resulting in the formation of cub-basins were revealed in the Ilutitun area, in addition to old meandering river channels.The Odogbolu area shows less vertical variation, but the same degree of lateral variation in sediment types compared to the coastal environment. However aquifers of high yield were fewer and more erratic. This was also characteristic of the basement environment.Water quality was found adequate throughout the survey area, despite the extreme variation in the vertical and lateral distribution of sediment types, except in the riverine coastal areas where the high total dissolved solids (18,360 ppm) and So4 content indicated probable saline water intrusion.|Theses collection|geophysical survey/surface methods/coastal area of Ondo state/Geoelectric sounding *||||||Amachree Igolima Tubobelem  Dagogo|Male|REFERENCE GROUP AND WORKER SATISFACTION: CASE STUDIES OF WORKER SATISFACTION AMONG NIGERIAN FACTORY WORKERS||||||PhD, Sociology|William H.

To the extent that the self arises and functions and is maintained through continued interaction with significant others in a symbolic social situation, this study attempted to delimit these significant others and to identify their social locations in order to determine their influence on worker satisfaction. The interactive situation ineluctably predisposes the worker to certain invidious comparisons with significant-others or reference group members, and the results of such comparisons predispose the worker to certain pat-terns of satisfactory or dissatisfactory behavior. The central organizing hypothesis for this study, therefore, is that reference group comparisons are significantly related to worker satisfaction. In addition, the study sought to investigate the shifting sources of reference group selection. The contention is that the selection of comparativereference groups is not random but shifts with the processes of industrialization and socialization into the industrial work force. There is a tendency to select congruent reference groups in order to engender effective industrial socialization and commitment. At the initial phase, ex-tended kin members located in non-industrial occupations are selected as reference group members, while at the intermediate phase, extended kin members in industrial occupations are selected. At the final phase, non-kin members in industrial occupations are selected as reference group members. This pattern of selection serves the function of reinforcing socialization.A sample of 141 Nigerian factory workers from four factories--Metal Containers, Metal Construction, both of which are located in Lagos, the capital of the Federal Re-public of Nigeria, Nigerian Bottling Company and Lafia Canning Factory, both of which are located in Ibadan, the regional capital of Western Nigeria--were interviewed in 1965. The sample does not represent a random sample of all factory workers in Nigeria. The selection of a non-random sample of the total work force was due primarily to the problems of gaining entry into other factories to legitimize the study. The sample, however, represents a random sample of the four factories in this study. The interview schedule utilized both forced-choice and open-ended questions and no attempt was made to use composite indices becauseof the difficulties of constructing theoretically valid measures for such indices. Contingency distributions constituted the main statistical tool of analysis, while statistical significance was ascertained by means of chi-square and derivative tests. Significance level was set at the conventional .05 level.The investigation of workers' attitudes in each of the areas of worker satisfaction--sector, occupation, and work--confirmed the general hypothesis that worker satisfaction is significantly related to worker comparisons with reference group members. Furthermore, it confirmed the proposition that satisfaction is not an overall entity but represents discrete clusters of attitudes and feelings. Satisfaction was found to increase with expanding spheres of social activity. Thus workers tended to be less satisfied with their work tasks than with their occupations, and less satisfied with their occupations than with their sectors of employment.A major substantive finding was that Nigerian factory workers were relatively satisfied with their sectorof employment and their occupation but relatively less satisfied with their specific work tasks. However, even this relative dissatisfaction with work tasks represents a fairly healthy sign when the recency of industrial development and the attendant difficulties of adjustment are taken into account.Besides comparisons with reference group members, skill level (which represents degrees of socialization into industrial life) and urban residence appear to be the major variables that condition sector and occupational satisfaction, while work control and the recognition of the worker's performance by his boss condition work satisfaction. Variables like the performance of traditional obligations such as help to members of the kinship group and demographic variables such as age, education, marital status, number of children and number of wives, were not found to be related to work satisfaction. Skill level, though related to sector and occupational satisfaction, was not found to be related to work satisfaction. Semi-skilled workers were found to be more satisfied with work tasks than skilled workers, and skilled workers slightly more satisfied than unskilled workers. However, in the areas of sector and occupational satisfaction, it was found that satisfaction increased with skill level.The sector of employment of the worker's father appears to be significantly related to the choice of the preferred sector of employment of the industrial worker. Those whose fathers were employed in non-agricultural sec-tors are found to be more likely to select non-agricultural sectors of employment than those workers whose fathers were in the agricultural sector.Significant differences exist among the fourfactories. In addition to the fact that they were established at different times--Metal Containers in 1940, Lafia Canning in 1954, Metal Construction in 1958 and Nigerian Bottling in 1962--significant differences were found in the mean age of the workers, marital status, rural-urban residence, skill level, job control, education, patterns of reference group comparisons and worker satisfaction. There were also differences in management policies toward conditions of work and also in union organization. Finally, in addition to the viability of reference group concept in analyzing worker satisfaction, the study also found a shifting pattern in the selection of reference group members. This pattern followed the degrees of socialization into industrial work. Unskilled workers tend to choose extended kin members in non-industrial occupations, while skilled workers chose extended kin-members in industrial occupations, as reference group members.|Theses collection|Nigerian Factory Workers/ worker satisfaction*||||||Asante Kingsley Kofi|Male||||||||||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,||||OAU||||||||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.
