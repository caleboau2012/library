In doing so, the study focused on the process and nature of Nigeria's decline from the relative economic buoyancy of most of the 1970s to a state of economic bankruptcy which has attained unprecedented proportions since 1986.  Thereafter, the study undertook a critical examination of Nigeria's foreign policy between 1975 and 1989, especially as it related to the liberation question, non-alignment, and economic integration in the West African sub-region.Primary data were collected through the informal interview technique. The technique was used to obtain information from top serving and retired government functionaries, private sector individuals, and politicians, connected with Nigeria's foreign policy process; and foreign diplomats serving in Nigeria. Archival and other relevant documents were also subjected to content analysis. These were supplemented with data collected from secondary sources mainly through library research.The study elucidated more clearly than before the nature of the linkage between economic factors and foreign policy. It showed in this respect, that a nation's commitment to its foreign policy goals and objectives need not fluctuate with the vagaries or bouts of crisis or buoyancy in its economy. The research has also provided a framework for the study of the foreign policies of structurally dependent countries like Nigeria which constitute the majority of state actors in the contemporary international system.On the basis of the mass of data collected and analysed, the study found out that while Nigeria's economic crises engendered a change of style in its foreign policy, they did not fundamentally alter the substance of its foreign policy. More specifically, the economic crises did not compromise the nation's traditional commitment to the liberation struggle, and to integration. The crises strengthened Nigeria's basic economic alignment with the Western market economy countries, a situation that has continued to promote the traditional foreign policy orientation of accommodation and/or friendship with the latter on almost all issues.The implications of these findings are two fold. First, Nigeria, is expected to continue to champion the cause of liberation in Southern Africa, and economic integration in West Africa inspite of the economic crises. Second, as long as Nigeria remains within the prevailing global capitalist economic system, the economic crises are expected to continue to foster close political and economic relations and alignment with the Western countries.|Theses Collection|Nigeria's economic issues/foreign policy/liberation/non-alignment/economic integration/informal interview technique/Western market economy*||||||NASSAR, Moshood Lanrewaju.|M|Study of the Nigerian bank for commerce and industry in the financing of small businesses in Nigeria.|||||| Ph.D.| O.

This informs the study which examined the operational pattern and socio-economic environment of the small-business financing scheme of the Nigerian Bank for Commerce and Industry (NBCI) with a view to appraising the performance.Data were collected from a sample of 244 small-scale businesses that were located in various states of the Federation. This represented about 50% of the beneficiaries as at 1987. Interviews were also held with the officials of the bank at its headquarters and zonal and branch offices.  Other sources of data included official records and other publications from the Financial Institutions.  The data were analysed using regression analysis, ratio analysis and descriptive statistics such as frequency distributions.Results of the analysis revealed a wide supply gap in meeting the effective demand of the clients.  In terms of sectoral spread of the investments, the results showed that Food and Building materials Subsector got the highest sanctions with 32.1% of the total value of all approved projects, while the metal fabrication subsector got 3.6% of the total sanctions.On the whole, the investment in equity of the clients projects have been lower than loan financing.  With respect to financing initial capital and expansion, the study revealed that the Bank's role has been more significant in the latter than in the former.  On the inter-relationship between the size of repayment and some socio-economic variables of the enterprise, the Pearson correlation analysis showed positive correlation between repayment and the number of product lines, retained earnings, the amount borrowed and the frequency of supervision by credit officials. On the whole, the analysis sustained the hypotheses that the small enterprises supported by NBCI were under capitalized and that the extent of under capitalization is related to supply gap.|Theses Collection|small-business financing/Financial Institutions/small-scale businesses/socio-economic variables/Bank's role/Financial Institutions/retained earnings*||||||POPOOLA, Adedotun Tajudeen. |M|The structure and context of the valuation of new ordinary shares in the Nigerian primary stock market.|||||| Ph.D. | O.

This information included reports on the evolution of and developments in the capital market, the daily official list of the Nigerian Stock Exchange, and the return on treasury bills.  Published reports obtained from the SEC and the CBN were used to obtain the operating and performance characteristics of sampled companies particularly from their prospectuses, and comparative information on what obtains on the stock markets of selected African countries from the literature.  Descriptive and inferential statistical tools were used in analysing results.On the issue of underpricing of new ordinary shares, the values of the ordinary shares of 35 previously unlisted companies as fixed by the SEC between 1977 and 1986 were compared with their subsequent performances on the NSE.  This represented 79.5% of the number of companies listed during the period, and 41.2% of the total number of companies listed by December, 1988.The findings indicated the indigenisation effort as the single, most important factor that contributed positively to the growth of the Nigerian capital market.  An apparent underpricing of new issues was detected, but this disappeared on an adjustment of the values for changes in the general economic situation.  On the other hand, the values suggested by the issuing houses consistently outperformed the market. The study did not support the viewpoint that the SEC should no longer price new issues, and recommendations, derived from the study, were made for the development of the stock market.|Theses Collection|Nigerian primary stock market./Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)/Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE)/Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)/ treasury bills/ indigenisation/ordinary shares / Nigerian capital market*||||||AWOTOKUN, Adekunle Meshack. |M|Legislative control of the executive in Nigeria under the second republic 1979-1983||||||Ph.D|O.

This was in the light of the failure of Nigeria's second attempt at operating a viable democratic political system.  The fall of the Second Republic raised some questions as to how and why the Presidential model which had been considered a better alternative to the parliamentary system also failed.  Attempts at explaining the demise of the Republic tend to suggest that the Executive arm was largely responsible.It was against this background that this study was undertaken to determine the extent to which the Executive arm was committed to upholding the ideals of public accountability and administrative responsiveness during the period examined. The study also attempted to determine the extent to which the legislature had succeeded or failed in performing its constitutional responsibility of controlling the Executive as prescribed in the Constitution.Primary data were collected from Hansard, Reports of the various Legislative Houses, Government publications and interviews.  Secondary data were collected, Reference materials as well as newspaper reports.The study discovered that Legislative Control of the Executive was weak during the Second Republic.  This weakness was traced to: the colonial legacy of Executive Supremacy, contradictions in the constitution and in its operation, inexperience of legislators; misuse of the impeachment mechanism; the power of political parties over legislators and corruption, among others.Finally, the study made some policy recommendation which could help in strengthening legislative control of the Executive during the Third Republic.  For instance the study proposed that there should be a review of the 1989 Constitution with the aim of having full-time legislators.  It was also recommended that elections into the legislature be conducted every six years in contrast to the Executive term of four years.  This would enable the legislators develop a stable system within which to perform their functions.  It would also help them to acquire some degree of expertise in areas of public policy!. This will help the present and future political actors to internalise the ideas of accountability, responsibility and responsiveness which in the final analysis determine the legitimacy and stability of regime types.  Finally, it was recommended that a number of modern facilities such as well equipped libraries, computers should be placed at the disposal of law makers.|Theses Collection|legislative control/Second Republic (1979-1983)/ Presidential model/parliamentary system/public accountability/administrative responsiveness/1989 Constitution/impeachment mechanism/ public policy*||||||ADEMOYE, Buraimo Atanda.|M| Output and hectarage responses of grain crops to price changes in Nigeria. ||||||M.Sc.| A.

The broad objective of the study is to analyse the factors causing annual fluctuations in the hectarage and output of the grain crops in Nigeria.Time-series data for the period 1965-1988 were used.  The data were obtained from the publications of the Federal Office of Statistics and the Central Bank of Nigeria. The data were analysed using the ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple regression techniques.Guinea corn and millet farmers expectedly react positively to expected producer prices of the crops.  However, maize and rice farmers react negatively to expected producer prices, due to inconsistent government agricultural policy.Guinea corn and millet compete effectively with groundnuts and cotton for resource - use, as indicated by the negative signs of their co-efficients.  In like manner, maize and rice compete with yam and cassava.  Farmers allocate their land for the cultivation of food grains mainly for subsistence purposes, as farmer population which is the risk aversion co-efficient carry positive signs.  Average rainfall during the critical period of growth of the grain crops was positively associated with the output of grain crops.The Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) has no significant impact on the supply response of grain crops yet.  This result is probably due to the fact that SAP was operational for only three out of the twenty-three years covered by this study. Thus, a quantitative and effective measurement of its effect at this time is premature.  The hectarage and output responses of the grain crops are mostly price inelastic, both in the short and long-runs.The postulated explanatory variables, namely, own-producer prices, price of substitute crops, farmer population, time trend, and rainfall accounted for between 46% and 72% of the variability in the hectarage and output responses of the grain crops as indicated by the value of the co-efficient of determination (R2).  The unexplained part (between 28% and 54%) of the supply response of grain crops farmers could be attributed mainly to inconsistent agricultural policy.  Other reasons include expectation problems; lack of credit; shortage of labour and capital; hired labour; old age of farmers and land tenure.|Theses Collection|multiple regression analysis/variability/grain crops/hectarage/Federal Office of Statistics/Central Bank of Nigeria./ordinary least squares (OLS)/ Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP)/time trend/farmer population/substitute crops/land tenure/hired labour*||||||ISIJOLA, Olaniyi Clement|M|Factors influencing the supply of agricultural credit by commercial banks in Nigeria.||||||M.Sc.|O.L.

The study was expected to identify significant factors influencing the supply of agricultural credit by commercial banks and their implications on government food self-sufficiency objectives were expected to emanate from the study.Data for the analysis came primarily from Central Bank of Nigeria publications such as the Annual Report and Statement of Accounts, Economic and Financial Review, Bullion and Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund Annual Report and Statement of Accounts.The Ordinary Least Square Regression method was used to estimate the coefficient of the parameters included in the specified regression models. The results obtained reveal that interest rate on agricultural production loan was significant and positively influenced the volume of credit supplied to the agricultural sector, over the studied period, by the commercial banks.  However, liquidity ratio of the commercial banks and the Central Bank prescribed minimum rediscount rate emerged significant and both negatively influenced the volume of credit supplied to agricultural sector over the studied period.Based on the results obtained from the study, the following policy recommendations were made: that government should continue to prescribe the interest rate on agricultural production loan; that Central Bank should persuade the commercial banks to come together and establish revolving-term loans which should be insured from the liquidity controls; and that government should also employ other budgetary measures such as price stabilisation and taxation allowance.The major contribution of this study to knowledge was that, the results obtained from this study revealed that it was the economic variables (nominal interest rates, Central Bank prescribed rediscount rate and liquidity ratio) rather than government programmes (Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme and Rural Banking Scheme) that significantly influenced the supply of agricultural credit by commercial banks.|Theses Collection| agricultural lending/commercial banks/government food self-sufficiency objectives/Central Bank of Nigeria/Annual Report/Statement of Accounts/Economic and Financial Review/ Ordinary Least Square Regression method/interest rate/ liquidity ratio/agricultural production loan/liquidity controls*||||||LADOKUN, Abiodun Emmanuel. |M|Maize yield fluctuations as related to resource use efficiency in Ijaye area of Oyo State.||||||M.Sc.|B.

The primary data for this study were obtained from a cross-sectional survey of 125 farmers drawn from Ijaye, Alabata, Ajobo and Onikete villages through the use of structured questionnaires. Regression analysis was used to identify factors that caused yield variations between "OAR" and "Non-OAR" program farmers and among the four village locations.  Analysis of variance (ANOVA) method was used to determine whether significant differences exist in the seed variety used by the two groups of farmers.  Marginal analysis techniques was used to measure efficiency of resource use of the farmers.The regression result showed that hired labour and cost of seeds were the significant factors that caused yield variations among "OAR" farmers whereas family labour, cost of seeds and cost of other purchased inputs were significant factors among "Non-OAR" farmers.  Across the four villages, cost of seed was the most significant and positive factor while family labour was only significant in Ajobo village.The ANOVA results indicated that seed variety was not statistically significant in explaining yield variations between OAR farmers who planted TZSR-W and "Non-OAR" farmers who planted the local variety. The reason adduced for this was the failure of the farmers to adopt the program as a whole package.  It was also indicated that village location has no significant influence on maize yield variations across the villages considered.Maize yield for the two groups of farmers and for the four village locations was inelastic with respect to the explanatory variables.  The sum of the input coefficients for the "OAR" and "Non-OAR" which indicate return to scale were 0.742 and 0.809 respectively.  And for the four villages, Alabata, Ijaye, Onikete and Ajobo, the values were 0.475, 0.839, 0.681, and 0.94 respectively. This is an indication that farmers in these groups and villages have not used the inputs beyond the rational production stage.The marginal analysis results showed that the "OAR" farmers used only seed input efficiently, while the "Non-OAR" used all the resources inefficiently. Among the villages, apart from Ajobo which used family, hired labour and seed input efficiently, all the other villages used only seed input efficiently.|Theses Collection|Maize farmers/Regression analysis/Analysis of variance (ANOVA)/ marginal analysis*||||||OSIFODUNRIN, Olufemi Adedotun.|M|A study of costs and returns in pig production in Ibadan, Nigeria.||||||M.Sc|B.

Data was collected from 30 pig farmers in Ibadan using pre-tested questionnaires. Data analysis involved descriptive, regression, budgetary and break-even analysis.The common breeds reared were the Large White, Landrace, Duroc and Crossbreeds. Only 2 farms had local breeds in addition to the exotic ones. All farmers used the intensive system of management. All farmers used the intensive system of management.  All the farmers had secondary occupation. 46.7% of the farmers did not have weighing balances.  37% of the farms had less than 100 pigs, 40% had between 100-200 pigs and 23% had over 200 pigs, with a mean of 176 pigs for all the farms.Regression analysis showed that age, pig farming experience and educational attainment of the pig farmers were important factors having a positive influence on management ability of the farmers.  76% of the variation in management ability of the farmers were explained by the independent variables stated above. The budgetary analysis revealed that the total variable cost constituted the bulk (83.33%) of the total cost of production among the farms, the value being largely dominated by feed cost (43.23%), veterinary cost (22.68%) and labour cost (11.82%).  The total variable cost per pig among the farmers was N182.90 while the fixed cost per pig was N37.24, thus making a total cost per pig of N22.14.The study revealed an established cost per pig of N226.29 and the operational cost of N182.90 per pig. The price per pig was N425.44 while the net revenue or profit per pig was N204.61 for the farms.  Though the budgetary analysis revealed profitable pig farming enterprises, the break-even analysis showed that only 60% of the farms were able to cover their cost of production with the revenue generated and were still left with some surplus.  The break-even quantities ranged from 43-372 pigs while the actual quantity ranged from 35-550 pigs.  The mean break-even quantity was 151 pigs. The break-even result led to the suggestion that farms with low but positive margins of safety and those with negative margins of safety should decrease their variable and fixed costs.  They should also expand their farms in terms of quantity of animals produced in order to increase their profits or reduce losses.  To aid the farmers in achieving these suggestions, problems such as high feed cost and scarcity of drugs have to be dealt with.|Theses Collection| pig production /protein supply/Large White/Landrace/Duroc/ Crossbreeds/management ability/feed cost/veterinary cost/labour cost/profitable pig farming enterprises/*||||||OGUNDELE, Kikelomo Olukemi.|F|Adoption of home improvement practices by women in Osogbo area of Osun State.|||||| M.Sc.|A.

Structured interview schedule was used to collect information from one hundred and ten women participants in June and July, 1991.Statistical methods were used in analysing the data. Chi-square and correlation analyses were used to determine the relationships between dependent and the independent variables.  The results showed that the welfare agents and radio were popular sources of awareness of the home improvement practices. Over 60% of the respondents completely adopted about 80% of the practices recommended. More than 50% of the respondents indicated satisfaction with the adoption of all the ten practices disseminated.  The reasons given for dissatisfaction with practices not completely adopted, ranged from non-availability of fund and materials in the immediate surrounding to other personal reasons.The study also showed that there was significant relationship between adoption level of home improvement practices and age, level of education, marital status, farm/non-farm occupation, minor occupation, religion and feeding pattern.Furthermore, correlation analysis showed positive and significant association between adoption levels of respondents and their income, formal education, cosmopoliteness, contact with welfare agents and social group membership.

There were many improved agricultural technologies and farm information available in the programme but the extension communication for dissemination of these improved agricultural technologies between research and extension workers on one hand, and between these agencies and farmers of the programme has not been studies.The specific objectives of the study were to examine the organizational structure of the programme so as to identify those involved in disseminating farm information and agricultural technologies, to identify the stock of improved agricultural technologies available and to determine channels of communication between the research and extension workers and between these agencies and the farmers.  For the respondents, the study was to determine their socio-economic characteristics which have influence on their frequency of contact.To achieve the stated objectives, data for the study was collected between November, 1990 and March, 1991 from the following number and categories of respondents, 9 research workers, 150 village level extension staff and 120 registered farmers of the programme. Two sets of questionnaires were administered to research workers, and a randomly selected samples of extension workers.  Interview schedule was used to collect information from randomly selected samples of programme registered farmers.  Participant observation was also used as data collection technique. The data collected were analyzed and subjected to statistical analyses with the use of chi-square, correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis.The findings showed that Subject Matter Specialists constituted a link between the research workers and the village level extension workers, while the village extension agents were responsible for face-to-face contacts and communication with farmers in the programme.  "Personal contact" "meeting" and "group discussion" were the main channels of communications of agricultural information and technologies. However, the use of mass media such as daily newspapers, magazine, journals, radio and television has not yet been institutionalized as sources of farm information in the programme.There was a positive and significant correlation between the following characteristics of extension agent, age, level of education attained, official status, length of service in the programme and years of experience and frequency of contact between research and extension workers, while the age of farmer, level of education of farmer, years of farming experience and knowledge of extension agent's name had significant relationship with the frequency of contact between extension agent and farmers in the programme.It was recommended that the programme should strengthen the research organs and extension service at farmers' level, and innovative educational techniques should be employed to increase opportunities for communication of farm information. Provision of adequate transport facilities for village level extension agent, and the establishment of more Agro-chemical and farm service centres in the programme area were also recommended.|Theses Collection|agricultural technologies/chi-square/correlation analysis/multiple regression analysis./sources of farm information/Agro-chemical/innovative educational techniques*||||||OYE, Michael.|M|The directorate approach to rural development.

Hence the setting up of DFRRI by the present Federal Military Government had raised eyebrows in some circles.  Some were concerned that the Directorate of Food, Roads and Rural Infrastructures (DFRRI) would fail just as its predecessors. Others felt that it was trying to grapple with too many rural problems without facing the realities of lack of funds and expertise.  Criticisms about the quality of DFRRI's projects and their usefulness to rural communities were increasing. It was, therefore, necessary to carry out an independent evaluative study of the programme to bring out facts which could answer the questions raised. To do this, the study investigated DFRRI's organizational setup, the extent of its achievements, and the attitudes of the rural populace to the organization.Four states, Oyo, Kwara, Plateau and Rivers were selected by stratified random technique.  Among the many aspects of the programme, feeder road construction, potable water supply and rural electrification were appraised.  Nonparametric statistics such as achievement indices, percentages, means, frequency counts, Spearman Rank Correlation (r), MannWhitney U test, KolmogorovSmirnov twosample test, ChiSquare and Kendall Coefficient (W) were used to analyse data from 462 rural respondents and DFRRI officials. The study has shown that DFRRI has made appreciable progress in the provision of rural feeder roads, potable water and electricity.  Within its short life, and given its prevailing constraints, the organization has been able to triple the rate of providing rural feeder roads.  Its Rural Water and Sanitation (RUWATSAN) scheme has had a positive impact on rural life, particularly in Kwara State where the incidence of guinea worm and other waterborne diseases has been appreciably reduced.  The provision of electricity has made life more comfortable to many rural communities. The study estimated that about 6,699 kilometres of roads were either reconstructed or newly constructed by DFRRI, while 17,056 kilometres were rehabilitated.  Five thousand and fiftyfour (5,054) rural communities have been reached with potable water, while 208 communities were linked with the national electrical grid. Detailed study of the selected states revealed DFRRI's outstanding weaknesses.  The most serious of these has been DFRRI's failure to adequately mobilise rural people for its projects.  This has led to the organization's inability to utilize local knowledge, manpower and other resources in its programme. Consequently, many rural communities have not seen the need to maintain infrastructures provided for them. Financial constraints have also been a great handicap to DFRRI's programme; some roads and wells have been left uncompleted and therefore, useless to rural communities.    Recommendations have pointed to the fact that DFRRI should have an overall policy of mobilizing and coordinating already existing organizations would then add their resources to DFRRI's to bring about the much desired rural upliftment.|Theses Collection|rural development/stratified random technique/Financial constraints/Directorate of Food, Roads and Rural Infrastructures (DFRRI)/rural electrification/potable water supply/ feeder road construction*||||||IDOWU, Olubunmi Alabi.|M|Evaluation of palm oil sludge, cowpea testa and extracted fermented corn by-product for chickens||||||M.Sc. | E.B.

A survey of rural poultry production in two selected locations was carried out in the first study.  Structure questionnaires (administered in Yoruba) were used.  More women (56% of respondents) were involved in poultry keeping. Mean flock size was 16, while increase in flock size was mainly by hatching. Extensive management system was practised by all.  Supplementary feeding of grains e.g. maize, and some crop by-products was practised.  Major constraint to production was Newcastle disease.  Productivity was at an average of 9 eggs per clutch and 3 clutches per year.  Modifications in housing, feeding and health management may improve chicken productivity at village level.Experiment II involved determination of voluntary intake of extracted fermented corn by-product (Corn starch residue, CSR), palm oil sludge (POS) and Cowpea testa (CT) by individually housed 15 cockerels, on a cafeteria choice basis.  The results indicated higher consumption of CSR (43.2g DM/bird/d) than CT (9.96g DM/bird/d), which was the least.  Consumption of CSR was similar to that of commercial growers mash (44.2g/DM/bird/d).  Corn starch residue is thus palatable to the birds.Experiment III was a six week study to investigate the effect of feeding a non-conventional ration (NCR) formulated mainly from the three tested feedstuffs in the proportions of POS, 35%; CSR, 55%; CT, 8% and 2% bone meal, on cockerels performance.  Forty-five Harco cockerels were allocated to three treatment rations: Ration 1, 100% commercial growers mash (CGR); Ration 2, 50% CGR + 50% non-conventional ration (NCR); Ration 3, 100% NCR.  The crude protein and energy levels of rations were: ration 1,12.7% and 2.321.76 ME kcal/kg; ration 2, 13.1% and 3,101.96 ME kcal/kg; ration 3,12.0% and 3,804.4 ME/kcal.  Mean daily feed intake was 95.0, 92.0 and 37.7g/bird for rations 1,2 and 3 respectively.  Rations 1 and 2 were similar in growth rate and feed utilization efficiency. Total replacement of growers ration with that made from non-conventional feedstuffs at the proportions used, is not viable.Experiment IV was an on-farm feeding trial to study the effect of supplementing NCR on the performance of free ranging chickens.  A total of 165 chickens were allocated to three treatment groups: (T1) 0. (T2) 30 and (T3) 60g supplemental feed/bird/d.  Usual management practices were followed in T1, while in T2 and T3 only feed supplementation was made in addition to what the chickens obtained from scavenging.  There was low consumption of the supplemental feed by T2 chickens (8.10g/bird/d); consumption by T3 birds (38.0g/bird/d) declined with time, as T2.  Average body weight gain was 0.013, 0.007 and 0.012g/gb.wt/d.  The supplemented non-conventional feed at 30g/day did not differ from those of unsupplemented scavenging chickens.  In this study, feed supplementation did not improve performance of scavenging chickens as expected.|Theses Collection|rural poultry production/poultry keeping/hatching/Extensive management system/extracted fermented corn by-product (Corn starch residue, CSR)/chicken productivity/crude protein/non-conventional ration (NCR)/feed utilization efficiency/ growth rate/consumption/scavenging chickens/*||||||OLORI, Victor Enishede.|M|An evaluation of two ecotypes of the Nigerian indigenous chicken.||||||M.Sc.|E.B.

The body weight and shank length of one hundred and twenty FI chicks were measured weekly for ten weeks.  Records of feed intake were also kept.  Records of 45 days egg production were kept for 61 hens housed in cages.  Sixty eggs of various shell colours were collected from the parent population for analysis monthly for seven months.  The dimensions of each egg, its weight and the weight of its components were measured as well as the shell thickness.  The proportion of the various egg components, shell density, shape index, surface area and weight per unit area were calculated.  Data compilation and analysis were done using D-Base IV and Statistical Analysis Systems (SAS) computer software respectively.The result showed that the FU was 27% heavier (P>0.05) than the YR at all ages.  The FU grew faster by 1.4g daily and had longer shanks.  The YR was more variable in body weight (Cv = 25.4% vs 17.4%).  The feed per gain ratio was 5.5g and 5.3g for the YR and FU respectively.  Hen housed egg production was 31.2% for the FU and 32.9% for the YR.  The mean egg weight was 37.6g with no difference between the ecotypes (P<0.05).  The ecotypes also did not differ (P<0.05) in other egg characteristics were affected (P<0.05) by the age of the laying flock, hen plumage and shell colour.The study shows that the YR and FU are different in body size but not in egg production and egg characteristics.  Egg composition and shell quality however depended on the length of lay.  The NI chickens laid both white and tinted eggs which are different in some characteristics.|Theses Collection|egg characteristics/body weight/shank length/feed intake/D-Base IV/Statistical Analysis Systems (SAS)/shanks*||||||TADESE, Olukayode Adewale|M| Growth and development of the body and reproductive tract of the female rabbit from birth to puberty.||||||M.Sc. | Babajide Somade.||Ile - Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Animal Science|1992.|||OAU |||||ix, 112p. |||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

However, there is a need for more research to be undertaken for a more thorough exploration of all aspects of the animal performance under tropical conditions.  This study was, therefore, aimed at investigating some of the changes that characterise the growth of the body and reproductive tract of the female rabbit from birth to puberty.Linear parameters of the body and organs of the reproductive tract of 60 female rabbits slaughtered at ages 0, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 112, 126, 140, 168 days and on the first day after mating were measured.  Means and standard errors for all the parameters were computed and data were further subjected to one-way analysis of variance, and linear, polynomial, and allometric regression analysis.Most parameters of the carcass showed slow initial growth rates until 84 days after which growth became more rapid.  However, dressing %, lean: bone ratio, lean content and bone content of the carcass had lower growth rates than the body throughout the period of the experiment.The rate of ovarian growth was low (0.775) although positive in the first 42 days of life while the uterus and oviduct showed negative growth rates during the same period.  All 3 organs showed highest positive growth between 126 and 168 days.  Mating significantly increased the weights of the ovary and oviduct but did not affect the uterus. Furthermore, uterine and oviducal weight were most highly correlated with ovarian weight between 126 and 168 days and in the first 84 days of life while there was no significant correlation between the weight of the ovary and uterine or oviducal lengths except between birth and 42 days.The results of this study indicate that the growth of the body of the rabbit can be divided into 3 main phases: The first 6 weeks of life; the next 8 weeks (up to day 98); and the last 10 weeks (until 168 days), while the growth of the reproductive tract can be divided into 4 stages of development: from birth to 42 days; 42-98 days; 98-126 days; and a variable interval between 126 days and the time of mating.|Theses Collection|Rabbits/underdeveloped tropical countries./puberty/carcass/ovarian growth/Mating /*||||||ADEBAYO, Timothy Abiodun.|M|Pilot scale trials on Guinea hen weed Petiveria alliacea L.

The procedure involved a test of the larvicidal activities of the extracts of P. alliacea on the 2ndinstar larvae of the three species of mosquito.  The larvae were exposed to different concentrations (1, 3, 5 and 10% (v/v) of the extracts in 500cc beakers in the laboratory and in artificial ponds 135 x 60 x 50 cm in the field.  All treatments were replicated 3 times.  Further, bioassays were carried out to investigate whether the extracts had any deterrent effect on oviposition in the gravid females of the three species of mosquitoes, and a test on the eggs of the mosquitoes for possible ovicidal effect of the extracts.It was observed that both the aqueous extract the turbid distillate were larvicidal to the 2ndinstar larvae of the test mosquitoes in the laboratory.  A concentration of 10% (v/v) aqueous extract caused 100% mortality in all the larvae while 10% (v/v) of the turbid distillate caused 100% mortality of the larvae of Ae. aegypti and Cx. pipiens fatiqans respectively and 61% mortality of the larvae of An.  gambiae. In the field, there was no adult emergence from any of the ponds treated with 10% aqueous extract.  The activity of the turbid distillate in the field was lower than its activity in the laboratory. The 10% concentration of the distillate showed effective oviposition deterrence to gravid females of Ae. aegypti and Cx. pipiens fatigans but none of the extracts was ovicidal. The study has shown that the extracts of P. alliacea could be used as a larvicide and oviposition deterrent to gravid females at breeding sites of mosquitoes.|Theses Collection|aqueous extracts/turbid distillate/Anopheles gambiae (vector of malaria parasites)/larvicidal/larvicidal/ pipiens fatigans/An.  gambiae/*||||||ADEGBITE, Adefemi John.|M|Effect of methods of establishment, planting date and population density of amaranth grain production. |||||| M.

Field studies were carried out to evaluate the influence of methods of establishment, planting date and population on the agronomic performance of the three Amaranthus species: Amaranthus cruentus L., A. hybridus L., and A. hypochondriacus L.  Also investigated in the screenhouse were the appropriate herbicides for controlling weeds in grain amaranths.The results showed that the Amaranthus species performed better in the early season than in the late season.  Generally, sends planted with sawdust emerged earlier than in the other methods of establishment.  Drilled, hillplanted and transplanted plants grew taller, had more inflorescences and produced higher grain yield than sawdusttreated plants.Generally, the amaranth species performed better in the May and June planting dates than in the August or September planting dates. plants were taller with more branches, longer inflorescences, larger leaf area and better grain yields in May and June than in August and September plantings.  Grain yield per plant was highest at 40,000 plants/ha. However, the highest grain  yield/ha irrespective of the species and date of planting was obtained at the highest population density of 160,000 plants per ha. A. hypochondriacus produced the highest grain yield of 917 and 886 kg/ha in May and June, respectively at 160,000 plants/ha.  In the screenhouse, the amaranthus species responded  similarly to the herbicide treatments; alachlor, diuron, metolachlor, and metribuzin were phytotoxic to the amaranth plants when applied preemergence, irrespective of the time of application, while imazaquin was lethal to the plants.  Alachlor, diuron, metolachlor and metribuzin applied postemergence were slightly toxic to the plants.  However, the toxicity symptoms disappeared later and subsequent growth and grain yield per plant were not adversely affected.  Bentazon was slightly toxic to the plants irrespective of the time of application and this toxicity was also overcome at the later stage of growth.  At the two times of application, fluazifopbutyland sethoxydim were nonphytotoxic to the plants irrespective of the species.  The plants treated with bentazon, fluazifopbutyl and sethoxydim, irrespective of the time of application, had similar length and dry weight of inflorescence and grain yield per plant with the control, indicating that these herbicides can be used selectively weed control in grain amaranth.|Theses Collection|grain amaranth production/inflorescences/hypochondriacus/Bentazon/Alachlor/diuron/metolachlor /metribuzin*||||||EVBUOMWAN, Felix Osaruironomwan.|M|Effect of herbicides and water regimes on weed control in a flood irrigated rice field at Itoikin in Epe Local Government area of Lagos State.||||||Ph.D.|||Ile - Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Plant Science |1992|||OAU |||||xii, 87p. |||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

Piperophos + propanil was applied at the rate of 3.9 kg a.i/ ha and 7.8 kg a.i/ha, bentazon + propanil at 4.0 kg a.i./ha and 8.0 kg a.i/ha, oxadiazon + propanil at 2.0 kg a.i/ ha and 4.0 kg a.i/ha, as well as propanil alone at 2.9 kg a.i/ha and 5.8 kg a.i/ha.  The most effective herbicides from these trials were thereafter evaluated under shallow (7.5 cm  10 cm) and deep water regimes (10 cm  17 cm) at four and six weeks after sowing rice. The results showed that Echinochloa colona (L.) Link and Cyperus rotundus L. were the most abundant and persistent weed species.  These two species were the least controlled by all the herbicides evaluated.  Among the herbicides, bentazon + propanil at 8.0 kg a.i/ha and piperophos + propanil at 3.9 and 7.8 kg a.i/ha were the most effective based upon the level of weed control and rice grain yield; the performance was not significantly different from the hand weeded control.  Piperophos + propanil at both rates applied at six weeks after sowing rice and under deep water regime gave the highest grain yield of 4 metric tons/ha. Following identification of the noxious weed species (F. colona and C. rotundus) from the field experiments, morphological and physiological responses of E. colona, C. rotundus, Ageratum conyzoides L. and Oryza sativa L. to a postemergence application of propanil were studied in order to understand the basis of their differential tolerance to the herbicide.  Propanil retention on the plant surface, uptake into the tissues and translocation to the subterranean parts of the four plant species were evaluated.  The leaf angle, leaf area, stomata density and distribution, presence of trichomes on the plant surface, thickness of epicuticular wax of the plant species were also studied.  Propanil residue in the plant tissues were determined using a precalibrated uv/vis spectrophotometer at 248 nm; the leaf area, leaf angle and stomata density were determined quantitatively, while the presence of trichomes on the plant surfaces, stomata distribution and thickness of epicuticular wax were observed under a high powered (x400) compound microscope.  Photomicrographs of the transverse sections (20 um) of the leaves of the four plant species were also taken for more detailed study.Results showed that A. conyzoides retained more propanil on the leaf surface than the other plant species; it also translocated more propanil to the stem and root than the other species.  Uptake into the plant tissues was also are in A. conyzoides than the other plant species.  Only A. conyzoides possessed trichomes on the plant surface; it also had the thinest epicuticular wax. These factors may be responsible for the observed susceptibility of A. conyzoides to propanil toxicity in the field.  There was limited or no translocation of propanil to the stem and root of E. colona, O. sativa and C. rotundus. It is inferred that the low retention of propanil on the leaf surface, little uptake into the plant tissues and limited or no translocation of propanil to the roots of E. colona and C. rotundus are important factors responsible for the tolerance of these weeds to propanil.|Theses Collection|weed species/Echinochloa colona (L.)/Cyperus rotundus L./Propanil retention/trichomesPhotomicrographs/ A. conyzoides/C. rotundus/E. colona/propanil.*||||||KING, Abu Bakarr.|M|Secondary school principalship and management challenges in a period of economic recession in the Gambia.||||||M.A. Ed.|Adekola Junaid.||Ile - Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Educational Administration and Planning |1992.|||OAU |||||ix, 138p. |||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

A validated questionnaire was used for the collection of data from 240 respondents.  Two hundred and two or 84.17% of them completed the questionnaires. Each of the null hypotheses generated for the study was tested at 0.05 level of significance using Chisquared statistical analysis.  For each of the four hypotheses, there was a significant difference between the frequency of responses for and against identified challenges relating to principals' administrative role, personnel, financial and school plant management.The results of the analyses showed that there was an increase in the number of unqualified teachers in the secondary schools during the period of economic recession in the Gambia.  The rapid growth in school enrolment during the period of economic recession necessitated an increase in the number of teachers employed among whom the majority were unqualified teachers.  There were major challenges in the areas of finance, school plant administration and personnel management in the Gambian secondary schools during the recession period.  The major challenges to school administrators included financial constraints in the secondary school system which resulted in the failure of some schools to achieve their educational objectives.  However, the methods adopted by the secondary school principals for coping with the management challenges in secondary school administration during the period of economic recession in The Gambia were appropriate.|Theses Collection|economic recession/null hypotheses/Chisquared statistical analysis/*||||||OYETADE, Thomas Ibitoye. |M|Effects of stand density on grain yield and other agronomic traits of single cross maize hybrids at Ile-Ife, NIgeria.||||||M.Sc. |C.O.

The objectives were to evaluate the response of the maize varieties to three stand densities: one, two and three plants per stand; to determine the optimum number of plants per hill for achieving maximum grain yield; and to determine the most appropriate withinrow spacing that would give optimum grain yield performance of the maize hybrids.The experimental area was ploughed and harrowed the maize, varieties were sown using four withinrow spacings of 24, 30, 40 and 60cm, and one between  row spacing of 71cm. For each withinrow spacing there were one, two or three plants per hill. Each plot consisted of four rows, 6m long.  The early and the late season plantings were carried out in 1988 on two locations whose soils had been subjected to continuous cropping for about ten years at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching and Research Farm.The experiment was replicated three times and the experimental design was a Randomized Complete Block (RCBD) with factorial arrangement. Data on agronomic traits included the following parameters: daysto50% tasselling and daysto50% silking, plant height and ear height measurements, ear number per ha field weight, shelling percentage and grain yield per ha.  All data were subjected to analysis of variance.  Significant means were separated using the least significant difference (Lsd) test.  A regression analysis was performed to determine the nature of yield response of maize varieties at the different withinrow spacings at one, two or three plants per hill. The maize cultivars differed significantly in their grain yields and number of ears per plot. The openpollinated variety (TZSRW1) and the white hybrid (832213), gave the highest grain yields and the highest number of ears, ha1 optimum economic grain yields were achieved at one plant per hill (r2 =0.90) using 24 cm withinrow spacing to give 55,555 plants hal and at two plants per hill (r2 =  0.71) using 30 cm withinrow spacing to give 88,888 plants ha-1. There was no significant difference in the grain yield values obtained at the two plant population levels.  Therefore, optimum economic grain yield can be obtained in this ecological zone by planting at a withinrow spacing of 24 cm and at one plant per hill, giving 55,555 plants, ha1|Theses Collection|hybrids/agronomic traits/Randomized Complete Block (RCBD)/silking/tasselling/cultivars/*||||||NURUDEEN, Owolabi Oladeji.|M|Effects of long-term cultivation and fertility management on soil physical characteristics.||||||M.Sc.|P.O.

The study was aimed at evaluating changes in these soil characteristics and also to analyse their spatial dependence as may have been affected by cultivation.  Two adjacent sites (cultivated and forest-fallow) were selected and used for this study.  To enable the use of geostatistical technique, soil sampling was carried out at regular intervals of 2m (except for infiltration test run at 8m interval) on transects established along two principal directions (North-South and East-West).Results from the study indicated coarser texture, reduced aggregate stability, increased density (1.2 to 1.6 Mgm-3) and reduced total porosity (54 to 38%) as a result of long-term cultivation.	These adverse changes in soil conditions resulted in significant reduction in soil infiltrability (87 to 28 cm/hr) and water retention (28 to 18%).  Increased rate of NPK fertilizer application, particularly single Nitrogen treatments aggravated soil degradation.Spatial analysis by geostatistical technique indicated that soil properties under forest-fallow had no spatial structure.  However, under cultivation, soil density, total porosity, clay and sand contents were anisotropically spatially dependent within a range of 32m.  Silt and water contents had no spatial structure while dispersion ratio was continuously spatially variable without a boundary.|Theses Collection|fertility management/particle size distribution/dispersion ratio/bulk density/total porosity/water infiltration/water retention/forest-fallow/geostatistical technique/spatial structure/dispersion ratio*||||||AKINWANDE, Emmanuel.|M|An appraisal of the planning and administration of adult literacy education programme in Ife North, South and Central local government areas of Osun State, Nigeria.||||||M.A. Ed.|T.O.

The study also examined the number of organised groups coopted into the programme and the level of their involvement. It investigated the difference between the programme's planning and administration in the three local government areas.Two hundred and ten subjects were selected for the study. Stratified random sampling technique was used in the selection which involved Local Inspectors of Education (LIE), Local Adult Education Officers (LAEO), Adult Literacy Education Programme Supervisors (ALEPS), Adult Literacy Education Instructors (ALEI) and adult learners grouped into regular client (RC), the droppedout (DOG) and graduated ones (GRG).  The study lasted eight months, May  December 1991, and it involved eighteen literacy centres equally chosen from both towns and villages in the three local Government areas.  Questionnaires, Observation Sheets, Oral Interview and Achievement tests otherwise called  End-of-Cycle test were used to collect data for the study.  The data collected were analysed using simple percentages one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and ttest for all the hypotheses generated for the study.  All the hypotheses were tested at 0.05 level of significance.The results of the study revealed that the extent of preparation, consultation and adoption given to the programme in the studied areas was inadequate.  Only four organised groups were involved in the programme and their involvement rate was 25.13%.  No qualified typist was employed and the Local Adult Education Officers were the 'alpha and omega'. Thus, the coordination of some administrative activities were hindered. The performance of adults in the programme was also hardly fair (X=33.06%).

Test plants were raised in the screenhouse and five actively growing seedlings per test plant were mechanically inoculated with each of the isolates.  Five differential hosts namely: Chenopodium amaranticolor, Dattura stramonium, physalis angulata, P. floridana and P. peruviana were used to distinguish the four isolates into symptomatologically distinct strains. PVMVM infected all the five differential hosts.  It infected C. amaranticolor locally and D. stramonium, P. angulata, P. floridana and P. peruviana systemically.PVMVB infected four of the differential hosts systemically namely:  D. stramonium, P. angulata, P. floridana and P. peruviana but failed to infect C. amaranticolor. PVMVS a lso infected four of the differential hosts.  It infected C. amaranticolor locally and P. angulata, P. floridana and P. peruviana systemically but failed to infect D. stramonium.   PVMV6B failed to infect any of the five differential hosts.The four isolates of PVMV were also differentiated by the type of symptoms that they induced on some susceptible test plants.

It was designed to find out differences in the response of the subjects concerning the management styles of their school principals and the tutors' level of task performances when the subjects were grouped according to status, gender and type of schools.A purposive sampling technique was used to select 550 students and 100 nurse tutors from the 11 Schools of Nursing and Schools of Midwifery. The investigator used a 45item questionnaire tested for reliability and validity to elicit response from the 650 subjects. A structured interview was also used to collect additional information from the school principals of the respondents on the type of management styles they perceived of themselves.  Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlational analysis, and test to determine statistically significant difference in the subjects responses at 0.05 level of probability.The findings from the study showed that there was a low and insignificant positive relationship between principals' management styles and tutors' tack performance (r = 0.36) while a moderately positive although statistically insignificant relationship was found between participatory tendency management and task performances (r = 0.50). The responses relating management styles with tutors' task performance varied according to status and type of schools of the subjects.  Furthermore, a moderately positive, but statistically insignificant relationship existed between management styles and cognitive component of task performance (r = 0.48). However, this contrasts a low and insignificant but positive relationship between management styles and interpersonal relations (r = 0.34), and very low and insignificant but positive relationship between management styles and professional competence (r = 0.17).  Further analysis revealed significant differences between the responses of the subjects from the Schools of Nursing and Schools of Midwifery on the principals' management styles (t = 2.77), and tutors' task performances (t = 6.64) respectively. The  study also showed significant differences between the tutors and students' responses to the principals' management style items (t =  1.99), and the tutors' task performance instrument (t = 4.89). Lastly, a significant difference was reported between the male and female subjects' responses on the tutors' task performances (t = 2.67), contrary to no significant difference found between the two sexes on principals' management style instrument (t = 0.17).   |Theses Collection|Midwifery/probability/professional competence/cognitive component/interpersonal relations/task performance/*||||||ADEGBULUGBE, Afolake Adefunke|F|Correlates of problem solving behaviours of undergraduate students.||||||M.A. Ed.|A.

The correlates examined were sex, age, academic ability and academic specialisation.  Four null hypotheses were postulated for the investigation. The sample for this study consisted of 306 undergraduate students of the Obafemi Awolowo University lleIfe, Nigeria.  They were chosen by stratified randomisation from four faculties of the university, namely Faculties of Arts, Law, Science, and Health Sciences. The Research Instrument for the study was the problem Solving Inventory (P.S.I.) which is used to assess people's perception of their personal problem solving behaviours and attitudes. The data obtained were analysed using the point biserial and eta correlation coefficients. The result of the study indicated that there is a significant relationship between the age of students and their personal problem solving behaviour (P < 0.05). Specifically, students of different age groups differ in their problem solving behaviour which tends to compare with age.  The result of the study also showed that there is a significant relationship between the academic ability of students and their problem solving behaviour (P < 0.05). In essence, students of high academic ability are better in their problem solving behaviour than students of average or low academic ability.  Furthermore, the result of the study indicated that there is no significant relationship between the sex of students and their problem solving behaviour (P > 0.05). The study also revealed that there is no significant relationship between the problem solving behaviour of students and their academic specialisation in Art or Science. The study revealed that age groups and varying academic abilities, unlike academic specialisation and sex, should be considered in differential counselling for undergraduate students.|Theses Collection|null hypotheses/stratified randomisation/point biserial/eta correlation/differential counselling*||||||AWOYELE, Ireti Folasade.|F|The influence of some personal and psychological variables on vocational exploratory behaviour of secondary school students in Ondo State.|||||| M.A. Ed.|J.A.

Age, gender and school class were the personal variables whose influences on vocational exploratory behaviour were examined in this study.  The study also examined the influence of psychological variables such as interest and values on the vocational exploratory behaviour of its subjects.The subjects of the study were 500 students selected through stratified random sampling, from five secondary schools in Ondo State.  School class and gender of subjects were the criteria for stratification.  The instrument used for data collection was a SelfConstructed Vocational Exploratory Behaviour Inventory which was adequately tested for validity and reliability. Data gathered were analysed using ttest, parametric ANOVA and Correlations. All hypotheses were tested at 0.05 level of significance.The results of the study showed that there are statistically significant differences in the vocational exploratory behaviour of male and female subjects (P < 0.05 (S)).  The male subjects of the study exhibited significantly higher vocational exploration than the females. Similarly, age of subjects was found to bear significant influences on their vocational exploration (P < 0.05(NS)).  However, no significant differences were found in the exhibition of vocational exploratory behaviour of students in different school classes (P > 0.05 (NS)).  This finding confirmed that perhaps class level does not bear significant influence on students' vocational explorations. The study however found that students' values and interest bore significant correlations with their vocational exploratory behaviour (rxy  = 0.72 and rxy = 0.79 respectively).The result of the study also confirmed that adolescence is indeed a period of fairly intensive vocational exploration.  About seventy-six percent (76.4%) of the subjects of this study (who were teenagers) recorded optimum scores on the vocational exploratory behaviour inventory.|Theses Collection|Psychological Variables/Vocational Exploratory behaviour/parametric ANOVA/ttest/*||||||DIBU-OJERINDE, Odusola Olutoyin|F|A comparison of selected methods for determining test item bias in junior school certificate mathematics examination for Federal Government colleges in Nigeria.||||||Ph.D. | J.A.

It compared biased items obtained from Transformed Item Difficulty (TID), ThreeParameter Item Characteristic Curve (ICC3) and Scheuneman chi square approaches.  The result of the JSCE Mathematics administered to 4,390 candidates in 41 Federal Government Colleges in Nigeria was the unit of analysis.  The primary objective was to see if any bias was likely to occur by using any of the three selected techniques based on group membership.Factor analysis was done on the JSCE Mathematics items to determine if the items could be considered unidimensional.  The three methods were used to examine item bias separately using the malefemale, urbanrural and ChristianIslamic comparative groups of the sample.  The factor analysis revealed oblique rotation correlational values that ranges between 0.177 and 0.023. This signifies statistical independence as well as  undimensionality of the 80 JSCE Mathematics items.The TID analysis indicated deviance in the rank ordered delta values among the three sets of discrete groups.  The trend of relationships among the malefemale, urbanrural and ChristianIslamic comparative groups were 0.916, 0.959 and 0.968 respectively.  This relationship did not support the bias evident in the rank ordered delta values comparison.  Similarly, the ICC3 analysis established bias in the estimated parameters categorization across the three dichotomised groups.  The bias was confirmed in the similarity of the ICC3 base line bivariates across the three dichotomised groups. The Scheuneman chi square analysis confirmed bias among the JSCE Mathematics items at df = 3; p < 0.05. A congruent relationship was established among the extreme items identified as biased in each of the comparative groups by the respective bias techniques.  The agreement among the detection methods revealed that the identification of biased items is not a random process.  This therefore showed that, there is an evidence of consistent bias in JSCE Mathematics items upon which the selected methods converge. The Scheuneman chi square and TID detection methods were found to be conceptually and computationally simple and reliable, while the ICC3 approach was discovered to be a thorough, technical and complex procedure.|Theses Collection|Transformed Item Difficulty (TID)/ThreeParameter Item Characteristic Curve (ICC3)/Scheuneman chi square/dichotomised groups/congruent relationship*||||||FAWOLE, Adekunle Nathanael.|M|Evaluation of the readability of selected secondary school mathematics textbooks in Oyo and Ondo States.||||||M.

Subjects were 301 senior secondary school two (SSS II) students selected by stratified sampling in seven secondary schools from seven local government areas in Ondo and Oyo States.  A rating scale was used to find out subjects' evaluation of the textbooks while the Fry graph readability method was employed to determine the readability of the textbooks.  Three passage from each textbook were sampled for this purpose.  The data obtained were analysed using descriptive statistics.The response of the students on the rating scale revealed that the authors of the selected textbooks did not show areas where the text materials were applicable in various out-of-school situations.  Their responses further indicated that the vocabulary used in the textbooks was not within the students' level of understanding, and words were not repeatedly used to bring about better understanding.  Further, their ratings showed that the sheets of the textbooks were thin and easily tore off and their covers were not durable.  Many of the sentences were too long and statements were clumsy.  While the students' responses on the rating scale indicated that the examples provided at the end of each section were inadequate and not easily understood. It also showed that the exercises in the textbooks were not very related to the examples preceding them and were generally more than necessary.However, the responses of the students on the rating scale with regard to cartoons, maps, graphs, charts, tables, and other pictorial sources in the textbooks revealed that they were helpful to their understanding of mathematics.  The letter prints of the textbooks were observed to be bold and clear and sizes of the type were legible.  Hence, fluent reading was made easy.  The responses of the students on the rating scale showed further that the design of the letters, lighting and ink colour were good enough and sizes of the margin and of the pages were moderate.  Also, the text materials were found to progress from simple to the more difficult and success in one learning task was able to reinforce subjects to progress to another.  Finally, the Fry graph readability technique indicated that the textbooks were appropriate for the age of the class of student readers for which they were written.|Theses Collection|readability indices/Fry graph readability/vocabulary*||||||OYELADE, Ayotunde Francis.|M|Exploration of developmentalism and its relevance to secondary school education in Oyo State. |||||| Ph.D. |A.I.

The concept of an ideology and the concept of a philosophy of education were therefore compared with the concept of developmentalism to find out if developmentalism is an ideology or a philosophy of education. Moreover the implementation of the concept of developmentaliam (such as implementation of moral education, vocational, scientific, and technological education) was analysed to find out if developmentalism is a relevant to Secondary School education in Oyo State.Data were collected through the use of relevant library materials interview reports and analysis of concept of developmentalism in education, particularly in Oyo State Secondary school education. Philosophical method was used to analyse the data collected. Thus language analysis of concepts like 'development', 'developmental education', 'developmentalism', and 'philosophy of education' was used to clarify and determine the limits of concepts and find out the relationship between developmentalism and secondary school education in Oyo State.  In this regard, phenomenological analysis, formal logic and argument by analogy were used to analyse the data.It was found that developmentalism is an eclectic educational theory based on the educational theories already available in the philosophies of realism, pragmatism and cultural reconstructioniam. Developmentalism however places much emphasis on the development of the Third World through the activities of the schools. It maintains that the schools should champion social reform activities that would urgently promote the development of our society.  Such activities should include the promotion of indigenous technology vocational orientation as well as scientific, religious, and moral instructions. In effect, developmentalism tends towards eventual identification with cultural reconstructionism.  In addition, developmentalism was found to be relevant to secondary school education in Oyo State because of its emphasis on the development of the wholechild (that is the development of moral, scientific, technological, vocational, religious, and other aspects of the child).  While Oyo State Secondary School education actually encourages scientific, technological vocational and religious developments of the child, it does not seem to sufficiently encourage moral, social, emotional, and agricultural developments.  Finally, library facilities and mass education which are needed for a thorough-going secondary education are not adequately provided.|Theses Collection|explorative philosophical analysis/developmentalism/phenomenological analysis/formal logic/argument by analogy/philosophies of realism/pragmatism/cultural reconstructioniam*||||||OYETUNJI, Lydia Olutoyin. |F|An evaluation of cognitive tasks in selected nursery schools in Ondo State.|||||| M.

The research investigated the cognitive tasks that are taught in the nursery school under the dimensions of perception, conception and language. The cognitive tasks were measured against the stipulation of the Nigerian Education Research Council (NERC).  The study also investigated whether the appropriate teaching aids for cognitive tasks are made available in the nursery schools.The subjects of the study were one hundred and twenty nursery schools employees, comprising of 24 headteachers and 96 classroom teachers.  Twenty four nursery schools located in eight local government areas of Ondo State were selected to ensure that all areas of the state were adequately represented.  The instrument used in the study consisted of the checklists and one questionnaire.  The checklists were the Teaching Aids Availability Inventory (TAAI) and the Teaching Aids Usage Inventory (TAUI) while the questionnaire was the Cognitive Tasks Questionnaire (CTQ).  The instruments were personally administered by the investigator. The resulting data were analyzed using percentages, chisquare tests, ttest and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) at the 0.05 level of significance.The results of statistical analysis showed that 50% of the nursery schools do not carry out cognitive tasks recommended by the Nigerian Educational Research Council. There is also a general neglect of tasks geared towards the development of perception in the child.  As regards the availability of teaching aids, the results reflected nonprovision of cognitive teaching aids in 50% of the nursery schools used.  The frequency with which teachers engage the pupils in cognitive tasks was also found to be influenced by teachers experience, teacher's gender, teacher's qualification and the type of school but was not influenced by the age of the teacher. On the ability of the teachers to make proper use of teaching aids, the results showed that this was dependent on experience of the teacher but independent of teacher's gender, teacher's age, teacher's qualification and type of school.|Theses Collection|cognitive tasks/perception/conception/Nigerian Education Research Council (NERC)/analysis of variance (ANOVA)/chisquare tests/*||||||OKOBI, Chike Paul.|M|Effects of audio-taped enrichment segment in teaching the structure of English on students performance in a college of education.||||||M.A. Ed.|J.I.

It also investigated the extent to which previous exposure of students to audio-taped instruction and students' ability level could affect learning from an audio-taped enrichment segment. It also investigated the extent to which students' attitude towards the learning of English Structure could be influenced by the use of an audio-taped enrichment segment in instruction.Two hundred part one students were randomly selected from all the departments of the Federal College of Education, Kontagora.  The students were stratified into ability levels (High, Medium and Low) based on their pre-test scores, using the inter-quartile range.  They were then randomly assigned to each of the treatment groups.  The control group received instruction without the audio-taped enrichment segment while the experimental group was exposed to an audiotaped enrichment segment. A test and questionnaire were administered before and after the treatment.  The scores of the students in both the pretest and posttest were analysed using ttest acid analysis of variance to test the hypotheses.The result showed that the students taught with the audiotaped enrichment segment performed significantly better and had a more positive attitude towards the structure of English than the students taught without and audiotaped enrichment segment.

The experimental design used was pretest posttest control.  Five hypotheses were generated for the study. The subjects were four hundred junior secondary school (JSS) two students who were randomly selected from secondary schools in Ilesa Local Government area of Osun State. They were divided into two equal groups. The first group was experimental group, and the other the control group. Using their last promotion examination scores in mathematics, each of the two groups was categorised into high, average and low ability subgroups. The instrument used for collecting data was a fortyitem multiple choice achievement test designed and validated by the researcher. After the pretest, the experimental group was taught relevant mathematical terms in solid geometry for two weeks. The remaining four weeks were used in teaching both the experimental and the control groups selected topics in solid geometry. The posttest was administered to the two groups after six weeks.  Data collected was subjected to the ttest and Ftest analyses.The comparison of the performances of high ability subjects in the two group revealed that those who were taught mathematical terms were significantly better than those who were not taught the terms, at P <0.05. In the case of the average ability groups the same result as above was obtained at P < 0.05.  The low ability subjects also performed significantly better than those in the control low ability group at P < O.05. The comparison of the two groups on the whole showed that those who were taught mathematical terms performed significantly better than their counterparts who were not taught the terms at P < 0.05. However, within the experimental group, the results showed that there were significant differences in performances in correlation to the ability groups at P < 0.05. The results showed that the secondary school students used for the study benefited from the use of advance organisers in teaching mathematics. |Theses Collection|solid geometry/fortyitem multiple choice achievement test/Ftest/ttest*||||||ESAN, Amos Olufemi. |M|The effect of teaching geometrical models on the performance of junior secondary school students in mathematics in secondary schools in Ilesa area, Nigeria.||||||M.A. Ed. |O.J.

The three groups were exposed to the same topics in geometry using different instructional techniques for each group.The first group was exposed to geometry using the teacherconstructed geometrical models.  The second group was taught the same way but was in addition encouraged to construct its own geometrical models. The third group which served as the control, was taught the same topics using the traditional method without the use of any aid. The experiment lasted for a period of six weeks.The instrument used was a fortyitem multiple choice achievement test based on geometry. The three groups were pretested before the commencement of the experiment.  One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was computed to find out if their mean performance was significant.  The result of the ANOVA showed that the groups had the same mathematical background before the experiment.  The effect of teaching geometrical models on the experimental groups was found using the 't' test statistics.The results of the study showed that students who were taught using geometrical models performed significantly better than those that were taught using traditional method (P < 0.05).  Students who constructed geometrical models also performed significantly better than those that were exposed to traditional method (P < 0.05). The study further revealed that there is no significant difference in the mean performance of the two experimental groups (P < 0.05).

A lesson plan is assumed to be incomplete if the teacher does not make provision for home assignment. However, not much systematic effort has been made on examining the relationship between home assignment and students' achievement in Social Studies at the Junior Secondary Schools (JSS). This study is, therefore, an attempt at examining the effects of home assignment on JSS achievement in Social Studies. Specifically, it examined the effects of two types of home assignment namely, Study Guide Questions and Guided Inquiry, on students' achievement in two units of social studies syllabus for JSS Class II. It also examined the relative effectiveness of study guide questions and guided inquiry on students' achievement in social studies.  The study involved 300 students and nine social studies teachers from nine JSS Class II in Ilesa Local Government area.  These schools were randomly selected from twenty-one co-educational JSS which had been clustered into three zones using proximity as the criterion.  Two research instruments, the course units and a fifty item achievement test based on the two units were used for the study.  The course units were on development and social changes in Nigeria over time. The achievement test was used both as a pretest and post-test. The scores in the pretest and the posttest for the three groups were collected and analysed using the one way analysis of variance and the ttest for pairwise comparison.  All the research hypotheses were tested at probability level of 0.05.The results of the hypotheses tested showed that students performed better in Social Studies at JSS when classroom teaching was complemented with specific home assignment than situations where no definite assignments were given. It was also discovered that students' achievement was better when study guide questions were used than when learners were not given definite home assignment.  Similarly, learners in the guided inquiry performed better in the achievement test than their counterparts without home assignment.  Finally, students who used the study guide questions of home assignment performed better than students who used the guided inquiry type of home assignment. |Theses Collection|lesson plan/Guided Inquiry/co-educational/pairwise comparison/hypotheses/probability*||||||BORODE, Grace Oluwatoyin.|F|Effect of team teaching on performance in mathematics and physics among secondary school students in Oyo State||||||M.A. Ed.|S.

The instrument used was a multiple choice test consisting of fifty objective questions in both mathematics and physics.  This was used for the pretest and post-test. The hypotheses generated were tested using ttest and Pearson moment correlational techniques where applicable. Significance level was put at the P=0.05.  The result indicated that teaching students mathematics concepts common to both mathematics and physics simultaneously is better than teaching them at separate time.  This is because students taught aspect of mathematics that occur in both physics and mathematics simultaneously perform better than their counterparts. As to retention of knowledge, the experimental group appeased to use the mathematical skills better in their future work than their counterparts because they perform better in problem solving in physics which indicated that there was a high correlation between their performance in Mathematics and Physics as revealed in their post test performances.

Modern Crafts like motor mechanic works, panel beating and motor electrical works are supposed to require rudiments of formal education with the acquisition of relevant skills. This research was therefore designed to determine the relevant knowledge of  physics that could help roadside motor mechanic apprentices in their job.The subjects were one hundred and nine motor mechanic apprentices randomly selected from Ile-Ife and Ibadan.  Sixtytwo of them completed secondary school while thirtythree were dropouts and the remaining fourteen were primary school leavers.  Seventyeight of them were taught essential principles in Physics and automechanics.  The remaining thirtyone apprentices formed the control group. Three research instruments were used. A questionnaire on personal data and practical performance were administered to each apprentice and his master.  In addition, a twentymultiple choice questions were used as preand post tests and an instructional package on essential physics for motor mechanics. The experiment lasted for six weeks. The four hypotheses generated were tested using Fratio and 't' test statistical techniques. Significance level was put at the P=0.05. The results indicated that apprentice motor mechanics who completed secondary school education performed better in their practical work than their counterparts who have lower educational background.  Assessment by the master mechanics revealed that they could identify spare parts and tools better than those with lower educational background.  They were also found to be superior in devising tools.

The objective was to determine the effect of group method on the performances of students in some Local Government Areas in Oyo State.The subjects were seven hundred and eight Senior Secondary class one (SSI) students randomly selected from fourteen secondary schools in Oyo State.  They worked in three types of groups.  The first group was named WorkingInGroup (WIG) while the second group was named WorkingWithGroup (WWG).  The two groups served as the experimental groups.  The third group was named the IndividualLearningTechnique (ILT) which was the normal classroom setting serving as the control group.  After putting the students into the small groups, the Junior School Certificate Examination (JSCE) results were used to classify them into ability groups.  There were two instruments developed and validated for this study.  The first was "Chemistry Achievement Test" (CAT) which was a multiplechoice test used for the pretest and posttest.  The second was the Instructional package to guide each type of group.  The hypotheses generated were tested using such statistical analysis as ttest, One Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and Scheffe test where applicable.At P = 0.05 significant level, the outcome of using the small group method was the significant differences recorded in the performance of those who worked in small groups when compared with the performance of those in the control group.  The achievement of those who worked in small groups improved and it was better than those whose classes were left in tact.  This was shown by the significant differences recorded in their performance in the posttest. ln the selfassigned small groups, the BelowAverage students benefitted more from smallgroup method than the AboveAverage students in the same type of group.  This was manifested by their performance which improved so much that in the posttest there was no difference between their performance and that of the AboveAverage students.  Generally, the achievement of the students who chose their own group members was better than the achievement of those whose members were teacherassigned.  This was shown by the significant difference recorded in the performance of the Below Average Students in the selfassigned small groups when compared with the performance of the BelowAverage Students in the teacherassigned small groups.  The Posttest scores showed that performance of the BelowAverage students in the selfassigned small groups compared favourable with the performance of the AboveAverage students in the same type of group.|Theses Collection|WorkingWithGroup (WWG)/WorkingInGroup (WIG)/IndividualLearningTechnique (ILT)/Chemistry Achievement Test(CAT)/hypotheses/Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)/Scheffe test/*||||||TYAGHER, Stephen Tsenongo.|M|A comparative study of the codes of practice (BS 8110: 1985 and NCPI 1: 1973) in the design of building structures.||||||M.Sc.|O.T.

The principles of plastic analysis and design incorporated in the British Standards: BS 8110 (1985) Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3: "Codes of practice for the Structural use of Concrete" were studied and applied to design a reinforced concrete building structure.  The same building was designed according to the Nigerian Code of Practice NCP1 (1973).  The comparison at the ultimate limit state was in terms of the plastic moments and the collapse loads; while that at the serviceability limit state was in terms of deflection, stresses and strains in both concrete and reinforcement.  A comparative analysis of the two designs obtained was then carried out in terms of safety and costs.The result indicated that the plastic moments given by the design according to BS 8110:1985 were 25.40KNm for the slabs and 118.30KNm for the beams.  The corresponding values for NCP 1: 1973 were 26.97KNm and 120.20KNm.  The collapse loads for bs 8110:1985 for the slabs and the beams were 18.50KN/m2 and 65.30KN/m2.  The plastic moments and the collapse loads given by BS 8110:1985 were, in principle, sufficiently close to the corresponding values given by NCP 1:1973.The serviceability limit state indicated that the design according to BS 8110:1985 gave lower deflections, lower strains, and lower stresses in concrete than the design according to NCP 1:1973.  Hence, BS 8110:1985 required less steel to resist the stresses.  The cost analysis indicated that the design according to BS 8110:1985 was N8,645.00 cheaper than that of NCP 1:1973. This represented about 3.3% of the total cost of the design. It was therefore concluded that while both codes produced satisfactory structures, BS 8110:1985 structure was cheaper and therefore more affordable.|Theses Collection|reinforced concrete building structure/serviceability limit states/Nigerian Code of Practice NCP1/*||||||JAIYEOBA, Taiwo Abimbola.|F|Landscape planning and management strategies for recreational centres in Ibadan metropolis.||||||M.Sc. |J.B.

Due to this fact, many people seek to satisfy their recreation demands by patronising these few recreation centres.  The results of this are congestion of the centres, overutilization of the existing facilities and landscape degeneration, One of the objectives of this study is to evaluate landscape planning concepts and management techniques for the recreation centres. Another objective is to study the landscape planning and management problems of these centres. The assessment of patronage level and factors affecting recreation pursuits is the third objective while the suggestion of planning strategies and design concepts aimed at improving recreation Centre's landscapes forms the last objective.Ibadan was chosen for this study because of its status as a major Nigerian urban area and as a state capital. The research methodology involves the administration of two sets of questionnaire to secure information from the management and visitors at recreation centres, The collected data were analyzed using the frequency distribution statistical method, the crosstabulation method, chisquare analytical method, and the Pearson Correlation Coefficients.The study reveals that the recreation centres lack adequate facilities that can meet the rising demand for recreation.  The existing facilities lack good maintenance and the landscapes of the centres face serious problems, both physical and financial.  The centres according to findings attract more visitors than they can cope with which has great consequences on the landscape and the facilities.  It is revealed that more urban recreation centres need to be provided and the existing ones improved. Various suggestions and recommendations are made based on the findings.  It is expected that the recreation needs of the urban dwellers will be adequately met if there is increase in the number of recreation centres, if there is provision of more facilities and if the management of the centres operate effective and efficient system of organization.|Theses Collection|recreation centres/leisure pursuits/congestion/crosstabulation method/chisquare analytical/Pearson Correlation Coefficients./urban area*||||||FANIRAN, Felix Olukayode.|M|The changing pattern of paralytic poliomyelitis in selected hospitals in Oyo State, Nigeria. ||||||M.Sc.|V.C.B.

In Nigeria, previous mass immunization exercises appeared to be ineffective since occurrence rates of paralytic poliomyelitis continue to increase yearly. It is therefore necessary to evaluate the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) currently being implemented in Oyo State in order to determine its effectiveness. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the EPI on  paralytic poliomyelitis with a view to recommending appropriate measures to the Oyo State Government on how to finally eradicate the disease.Six hospitals were selected from the four geographical zones of the State.  A total of 4,339 polio cases recorded in the admission registers of the six selected physiotherapy departments and a total of 2,280 casenotes were studied. The monthly/annual occurrence rates and the percentage of paralytic polio to total patient load were determined from the records obtained through the admission registers. Other relevant information such as patient's sex, muscle groups and vaccination history were reviewed from the case notes.The data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential (Chi-square test) analysis. The results showed that the monthly incidence rate was 17 cases per million population for Oyo State while the annual incidence rate was 201 cases per million population.  This study found that the annual incidence of the disease decreased by 50.6% within the period 198089 with an average of 5.06% per annum.  The predicted percentage reduction for 1990 was projected to be 55.7% which is higher than the 50.0% predicted by the Federal Government indicating that the immunization programme has been effective.On Sex and age distribution, it was observed that children who were one to two years old constituted the largest group affected both before and after the EPI. There was, however, a significant increase (P < 0.05) among the over 3 years old after EPI.  Although males were more affected than females, there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the sexes. The mostly affected muscle group was the quadriceps both before and after the EPI.  At least two muscle groups were attacked per patient.  The  percentage of paralytic polio to total patient load ranged between 9.8% to 15.8% as against 3040% previously quoted in literature. It was also found that there was a significant difference (P < 0.001) between the vaccinated polio groups before and after EPI.The significant reduction in occurrence of paralytic polio in this study was attributed to the mass immunizations programme. The success of the programme was due to the  Mass Social Mobilisation Strategy. The study recommended:(i)	the setting up of a standing research committee to monitor the immunization programme with respect to paralytic polio,(ii)	the need to sustain the present programme so that the  incidence would remain permanently lowered,(iii)	That the immunized age group (02 years) be extended to (05 years),(iv)	Physiotherapists should take greater interest in the EPI.|Theses Collection|immunization/Paralytic Poliomyelitis/Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI)/physiotherapy/vaccination/ Mass Social Mobilisation Strategy.*||||||OYELADE, Emmanuel Oguntoye|M|The practice of Islam in Yoruba land 1830-1983.||||||Ph.D. |I.A.

It further attempted an assessment of the factors and their effects on the expansion of Islam in Western Nigeria.  The thesis also aimed at correcting certain misconception about Islamic faith.The methodology employed included a comparison and an evaluation of both written and oral information; a phenomenological method which tries to assess the thought-patterns, emotional feelings, and practical responses of the various religious groups constantly interacting in the study area.  It also included a sociological approach which employs sociological methods of evaluation.  It further involved a documentary method used for analysing both primary and secondary sources.  Among the primary sources used were oral data and archival documents such as colonial reports, newspapers and mission reports.  These were supplemented by secondary sources such as magazines, articles, theses, long essays, and works by historians, sociologists, politicians, religious scholars and legal specialists.It was found that Yoruba Muslims were tolerant, accommodating and progressive.  As a result, they won the admiration of the traditional worshippers.  This led to the peaceful expansion of Islam.  It was further found that the attitudes of Yoruba Muslims were firmly rooted in their liberalist and universalist views of God as king and provider for all human beings. In addition, the Quranic views about and His followers, the Muslims' loyalty to the Yoruba cultural heritage, and the acceptance of the realities of common socio-political aspirations of the Yoruba, all helped to foster unity, peace and progress in the heterogenous society.  The consequence of the above factors was that both Christian leaders and colonial administrators were well-disposed to Muslims.  They encouraged the Muslims to accept Western education and British rule.  As a result, the Christians lost the monopoly of Western Education as well as the jobs of the civil service.  Another consequence of the above factors was that Yoruba Muslims participated freely in festivals, inter-religious marriages, and accepted positions of authority as kings and rulers in Yoruba communities.|Theses Collection| Islam/pluralistic society/phenomenological method/liberalist/universalist/heterogenous society*||||||OYEYEMI, Yoonus Adetoyeje.|M|Effects of aerobic training on cardiovascular responses during head-down inversion. ||||||M.Sc.| J.

Currently, the effect of patients physical fitness on cardiovascular responses during inversion therapy remain unexplored. This study was therefore designed to investigate the effects of aerobic training on cardiovascular responses during waist level headdown inversion. A 2 (groups) by 3 (time frames) experimental design was employed. Twentyone healthy male volunteers (23.42.1 years old) participated in the study.  The estimated maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) determined using the Cooper's 1.5 miles run test. Twentyfour hours later, the subjects reported in the laboratory and assumed a quiet pronelying position for one hour on the inversion device. Subsequently, the heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were monitored for 10 minutes each in pronelying position and during headdown inversion from the waistline.  From the HR and blood  pressure measurement, the purse pressure (PP), mean arterial blood pressure (MBP), ratepressure product (RPP) and baroreflex sensitivity (BS) were derived using standard formulae. The subjects assigned to the experimental group (n = 10) were subjected to a 6 weeks aerobic exercise programme.  The exercise intensity was such as to increase heart rate to 6085% of the subjects age predicted maximal heart rate.  Subjects in the control group (n = 11) did not undergo any physical training. The estimated VO2max of all the subjects and their  cardiovascular responses during inversion were again examined at the third and sixth week of the study. Statistical evaluation was by a 2  factor repeated measures analysis of variance.  An alpha level of 0.05 was adopted in the study. There was a significant (p < 0.05) increase in HR,SBP, DBP, MBP, and RPP; and decrease in PP during headdown inversion.  Following six weeks of aerobic training, the subjects' estimated VO2max increased significantly (p < 0.05) from 47.717.06 ml. kg-1 min-1 to 56.914.23 ml. kg-1 min-1. No cardiovascular learning effect was noticed following repeated inversion procedures. The HR and RPP responses during inversion, as well as the resting HR were significantly (p < 0.05) following aerobic training. However, SBP, DBP, PP, MBP and BS were unaffected by aerobic training. The above findings suggest that improved aerobic fitness is associated with less stress being placed on the heart during headdown inversion.Based on the above findings, it is recommended that the headdown inversion procedure should be utilized with caution because of the marked increase in cardiovascular responses and decrease in PP obtained during inversion.  For safety purposes, it is necessary to monitor the cardiovascular responses of high risk subjects before, during and shortly after inversion therapy.  A knowledge of the patients aerobic fitness may assist the physical therapist in estimating the patients tolerance to headdown inversion.     |Theses Collection|Physical therapist/therapeutic/cardiovascular/aerobic/pronelying/systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP)/mean arterial blood pressure (MBP)/ratepressure product (RPP)/baroreflex sensitivity (BS)/olerance*||||||ADOGAME, Afeosemime Unuose.|M|The pentecostal movement among the Akoko-Edo people of Bendel State 1932-1982.|||||| M.A.|B.

Three Apostolic groups of Churches were focused on, namely: The Apostolic Church (T.A.C.), Christ Apostolic Church (C.A.C.) and Apostle Babalola Christ Apostolic Church (A.B.C.A.C.) or First Christ Apostolic Church (F.C.A.C.).The similarities, differences and the divisive trends among these Pentecostal groups were examined. The relevance of this movement to the rapid social change in the Akoko-Edo area was also brought into limelight.  The methodology adopted for the analysis and interpretation of data were the historical method and the hermeneutical phenomenological approach. The research was also based on oral and library sources and documents. This study revealed that ritual recognition is given to nature by the C.A.C. and A.B.C.A.C. whereas this is not the case in the other Pentecostal Movements with similar doctrine.  This makes their worldwide different from the other Pentecostal. Through the use of consecrated water, Christianity is being indigenised to suit the traditional culture.It was further discovered the A.B.C.A.C. broke away from the C.A.C.  not on doctrinal issues but factors such as administrative excesses, personality clashes. However, apart from some differences in the polity and doctrines, they seem to share common religious convictions.  The thesis concluded that the Pentecostal Movement would become perhaps the most dominant and widespread of new religious movements in this part of Nigeria.  The Movement can provide an ample opportunity for studies in African Christian theology.|Theses Collection|Pentecostal Movement/The Apostolic Church (T.A.C.)/Christ Apostolic Church (C.A.C.)/Apostle Babalola Christ Apostolic Church (A.B.C.A.C.)/First Christ Apostolic Church (F.C.A.C.)/hermeneutical phenomenological approach./ritual recognition/doctrine/*||||||KOMOLAFE, Olaitan.|F| The impact of Islam on the people of Akoko North 1886-1986||||||M.A.|S.G.A.

It focussed particularly on the role of the Ulama (Muslim scholars) and various Muslim organizations such as the AnsarUdDeen Society of Nigeria, the Ahmadiyya Movement of Nigeria and the NawarUdDeen Society of Nigeria in the spread of Islam in Akoko North.  The relevance of Islam to the rapid social change in the area was also discussed.  Furthermore, the study attempted a comparative analysis of Islam with Christianity and Traditional Religion. The methodology employed involved the gathering of data, analysing and interpreting them historically and theologically.  Relevant literature including books, journals, archival materials and private papers were consulted.The study found that Islam has profoundly affected the political and socio-cultural life of the people of Akoko North.  For example, the use of turban and adoption of eleha (purdah and seclusion) imposed on women were found to be widespread.  Some others areas where Islam has affected and modified traditional life include naming ceremonies, marriages, inheritance burials, etc. and even kingship. The investigation also revealed increase in the number of muslims going on holy pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca and Medina from the area.  The study therefore concluded that Islam is becoming the dominant and the most wide spread religion in most parts of Akoko North.|Theses Collection|Islam/Ulama (Muslim scholars)/AnsarUdDeen Society of Nigeria/Ahmadiyya Movement of Nigeria/NawarUdDeen Society of Nigeria/eleha (purdah and seclusion)/holy pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca and Medina*||||||OGUNGBILE, David Olugbenga.|M|A comparative study of revelation in Aladura christianity and divination in Yoruba religious tradition in Ile-Ife||||||M.A. |Jacob K.

It also sought to highlight the comparative elements of revelation in Aladura Christianity and Ifa divination in Yoruba religious tradition. The study further attempted to demonstrate the significance of interaction between Yoruba traditional religion and Aladura Christianity.The methodology employed is a combination of phenomenological approach and comparative analysis.  Worship services, ceremonies and rituals were observed in some selected Aladura Churches in IleIfe for a period of two years.  These religious manifestations were analyzed and then compared with Ifa divination.  Relevant literature including books, journals, newspapers and archival materials were also consulted.The study revealed that there are similarities between revelation in Aladura Christianity and in Ifa divination. These similarities are in the areas of invocation, in the use of the spoken words as well as in the diagnosis and the prescription of solutions to human existential problems.  The study also revealed that the apparent points of divergence could be found in the different claims of the source of their powers, in the paraphernalia of the two systems and in certain areas of their practices.The thesis concluded that the spirituality of the Yoruba is the basis upon which Ifa divination practice and Aladura models of revelation operate.  The relevance of this finding is that such a model of religious pluralism and interaction is essential to societal harmony and integration.|Theses Collection|Religion/Ifa divination/prophecies/trances/christianity/worship services/ceremonies/rituals/ *||||||OLAYINKA, Bolaji Olukemi.|F|A feminist-hermeneutical approach towards understanding the roles of some old testament valiant women.||||||M.

It also attempted a comparative analysis of the roles of three prominent women in Nigeria's historical past, namely: Emotan of Benin, Moremi of Ile Ife and Queen Amina of Zaria. A Feminist-Hermeneutical approach was adopted in the study particularly in the understanding of the meaning of 'ishshah in the Ancient Near East, the Old Testament and the Nigerian Cultural Society. In addition to a critical review of relevant literature, the oral interview method was adopted, based on an interview guide. The size selected for interview were twentyfive which included rural women, "Better Life Programme" officials, some members of Women Organisations in Nigeria and members of the Academic Community. The study revealed that women in different cultures and different periods perform similar roles  and are ascribed similar status in most human societies worldwide.  It also showed different ways in which women have exerted themselves in predominantly patriarchal societies.The study has given us an insight into the roles played by biblical women and how their roles could be contextualized and thus made meaningful in our contemporary Nigerian Society.

Specifically, the study attempted to account for the transient nature of meaning by providing a framework for the triadic interaction that must exist between contexts, linguistic expressions and interpretations.  In addition, the thesis attempted a comparison of ambiguity with other semantic forms and proposed a classification of ambiguities.The methodology employed included the use of oral interviews among the native speakers of Yoruba language, and a critical study of poetic, prose and dramatic works in the Yoruba language, using Kress and Odell's Paraphrastic Criterion as a framework for descriptive analysis.  The study also used the method of classification based on the parameters of location, context, derivation and nature of the luci of ambiguity.  A contrastive analysis of ambiguity and various semantic forms such as anomaly, paraphrase, vagueness and synonymy was carried out.The thesis established that context specifications which are performed by qualifiers and modifiers in Yoruba are crucial to semantic output in the language.  The thesis also found that ambiguity is a product of a language system and linguistic behaviour. It was established that good orthography, paraphrasing and context specification are potent mechanisms for disambiguation.The thesis concluded that ambiguity, as a semantic form, could make the users of constituents as well as sentences more elastic and so refuted the popular belief that ambiguities are always a linguistic nuisance.|Theses Collection|Yoruba literacy texts/triadic interaction/linguistic expressions/comparison of ambiguity/poetic, prose and dramatic works/Kress and Odell's Paraphrastic Criterion/potent mechanisms for disambiguation*||||||YAKUBU, John Ademola|M|The proper law of contract.||||||Ph.D.|I.O.

The operation and adequacy of various theories formulated to cater for international contract problems were also examined. The modern formulation of the proper law of contract was subjected to critical legal flak. In order to appreciate the problems inherent in the practical application of the proper law of contract approach, standard form contracts device was discussed and equipment leasing contract was analyzed to show the fallacy in the conception that there is usually mutual  agreement that a contract should be governed by a particular law.The judicial inert and mechanical application of laws by the courts as well as inadequate statutory provisions to cater for contract problems were exposed to show the need for revaluation of existing rules and principles.Materials for this work were derived from primary and secondary sources.  Primary sources in this respect are private international law statutes, municipal statutes and court decisions. The secondary sources of information in respect of this work were derived from textbooks and articles in learned journals. Following our findings, this study concluded that the courts should not adopt a mechanical approach in determining the proper law. The courts should consider the facts of each case so that the decision of the court in each case would be in accordance with the dictates of justice.  We also advocated the need for the enactment of statutes in Nigeria to take care of commercial activities of international dimension.

There is obvious possibility of utilising Datura metel leaves for local drug production in Nigeria if its formulation, toxicity and efficacy are established.D. metel powdered leaf has been formulated into compacts using wet granulation process. The effects of changes in particle size of D. metel powder and binder volume were studied.  Four different binders viz: polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), gelatin, cassava starch and acacia were each used at concentrations of 25%w/w to determine the effect of binder type and concentration on the compacts formulated. The resulting granules were analyzed for mean size, size distribution and friability and their compacts tested for hardness, disintegration, friability and assayed for hyoscine content.The necessary toxicological test prior to plant drug formulation using D. stramonium as control was carried out of virgin female mice. Suspensions of both plants were administered to the mice and their toxicity assessed from histopathologic abnormalities observed in the small intestine, kidney and liver of the mice. Preliminary clinical trial was done using nonplacebo controlled cross-over method on the formulated compacts.  The antispasmodic efficacy of the compacts was compared with Buscopan (R), a known antispasmodic agent and the results analyzed using non-parametric statistics.Bigger and less friable granules resulting in stronger and less friable compacts with longer disintegration time were produced as the powder size, binder volume or concentration was increased.  Cassava starch, PVP and gelatin proved to be very good binders for D. Metel powder producing granules and compacts of good physical properties which remained stable on storage.  The physical properties of compacts with acacia binder varied significantly on storage.  The formulation factors considered; powder size, binder type and concentration did not affect the hyoscine content in the compacts.  Hyoscine content was found to be 0.23% and 0.30% in D. metel and D. stramonium respectively.  The D. stramonium was found to be relatively more toxic than D. metel and the observed histopathologic abnormalities were dose dependent.  The efficacy and duration of action for both Buscopan (R) and D. metel compacts were found to be statistically similar.|Theses Collection|Datura metel Linn (Solanaceae)/Datura stramonium/antispasmodic/hyoscine/polyvinylpyrrolidone/nonplacebo/Buscopan.*||||||EZEOMAH, Emenike|M|Bioavailability studies on different brands of quinine in man.||||||M.Sc.|F.A.

The bioavailability of three formulations of this drug, Quinine dihydrocholoride (intravenous solution), quinine sulphate capsule and quinine sulphate (Plain) tablets, were investigated in 12 healthy male volunteers in a randomised sequence, using a specific and sensitive reversedphase HPLC method. In a single dose study, 600mg of the capsules and plain tablets were administered orally after overnight fasting, and 600mg of the dihydrochloride in 500ml normal saline solution was given as a continuous intravenous infusion at constant rate over four hours. The results of this study indicate that the plasma quinine levels (AUC) for the dihydrochloride, sulphate capsules and tablets were 133.732.4, 92.9333.7, and 69.24.9 ugml-1 hr [Mean  S.D.] respectively. Quinine by intravenous infusion resulted in higher plasma levels than oral dosing. The plasma quinine concentrations during administration of the capsules and tablets were not significantly different (P > 0.05). The elimination halflives were 12.53.7, 10.72.4 and 10.080.9 hrs [mean + S.D.] for infusion, capsules and tablets respectively.

Scientific interest in their spectrum of bioactivities and structure-activity profile has prompted the search general synthetic route to 1,3Diaryl2propanol.  This work has explored one such route starting from chalcone which are the biogenetic precursor of 1,3Diaryl2propanol.The investigated synthetic route involved the conjugate reduction of chalcone to the corresponding hydrochalcols and their subsequent dehydration to 1,3diarylpropenes. Oxymercurationdemercuration of the 1,3diarylpropenes was expected to furnish the desired 1,3diaryl2propanol. Three chalcone, namely, chalcone, 2methoxychalcone and 2', 4', 3trihydroxychalcone were synthesised in 86.5, 83.7 and 40.6% yield, respectively, by ClaisenSchmidt condensation of appropriate starting materials.The major product of the direct hydride reduction of a chalcone was found to be the dihydrochalcol, although the reductions were complicated by a multiplicity of products. In addition, the yield of the dihydrochalcol in lithium aluminium hydride reductions was increased in the presence of a transitionmetal halide such as copper (I) chloride. The chalcone were reduced to the corresponding dihydrochalcones in good yield by catalytic transfer hydrogenation using tetrahydrofuran as solvent, cyclohexene as the donor, 10% Palladium-Charcoal as the catalyst, with an optimum reduction time of four hours.  Phenolic groups were found inert, while ferric chloride was observed to promote the conversion of the chalcone to the 1,3diarylpropane derivative, during transfer hydrogenation.Sodium borohydride adsorbed on alumina was found to be a more efficient reducing agent than the hydride alone, and quantitatively reduced the dihydrochalcones to the dihydrochalcols.  Dihydrochalcols may thus be most conveniently prepared by catalytic transfer hydrogenation of chalcone to the dihydrochalcones, followed by reduction with sodium borohydride adsorbed on alumina.Dehydration of the dihydrochalcols by oxalic acid gave the corresponding 1,3diarylpropenes as the major products.  Alternative dehydration  procedures using iodine and ferric chloride, respectively, were found inferior to oxalic acid dehydration. The 1,3diarylpropenes were found unreactive under the standard  oxymercurationdemercuration conditions.  Analogous experiments with the closely related stilbene revealed that the unreactivity may be intrinsic to alkylbridged diphenyl systems. The proposed synthetic route has thus been shown to be feasible up to the penultimate step, yielding the postulated 1,3diarylpropenes.  However, the unreactivity of the 1,3diarylpropenes to oxymercuration implies that an alternative rehydration procedure is required. If this is achieved, then a general synthetic route to 1,3diaryl2propanol starting from chalcone would have been developed.|Theses Collection|1,3-Diaryl-2-propanols/flavonoids/chalcone/biogenetic precursor/hydrochalcols/Oxymercurationdemercuration/2methoxychalcone/2', 4', 3trihydroxychalcone/tetrahydrofuran/cyclohexene/Palladium-Charcoal/Phenolic/ferric/oxalic.*||||||KEHINDE, Ibiyemi Oluyemisi.|F|Synthesis of novel quinoline derivatives. ||||||M.Sc. |J.O.

Quinine, one of the naturally occurring quinoline is used as an antimalarial drug. Its structure forms the template for the synthetic antimalarials, for example, chloroquine and amodiaquine.Quinoline have found usage as antiamoebic agents, for example, vioform.  They have also been used as antimicrobial agents, for example, nalidixic acid and its derivatives. Quinoline have been obtained using the classical Skraup method or its synthetic variations.ln this work, quinoline have been prepared through novel routes using the ClaisenSchmidt method to form 2'aminochalcones which are the starting materials for the preparation of the quinoline. The 2'aminochalcones underwent acid catalysed cyclocondensation reaction to form 2,3dihydro2phenyl4-quinolones. Sodium Borohydride reduction of the dihydroquinolones in alcohol gave 2,3dihydro2phenyl4quinolols which underwent catalytic dehydration reaction with toluene suffonic acid in toluene at reflux to give two products viz, 2phenyl quinoline and [1H]2,3,4tetrahydroquinolines in fairly good yields instead of the theoretically expected 2phenyl2hydro[IHIquinoline.The structures of the synthesized compounds were unambiguously proved by use of physicochemical techniques, viz, lr, 1H13C Nmr and Ms. The amino group of the chalcone and quinolones appeared in the lr spectra at 32903420 cm1 while the carbonyl functions were prominent at 16201720cm1. The aromatic C=C absorption appeared at 15901610cml. The hydroxyl groups of the quinolol appeared at 32503380cm1. The 1Hnmr spectra of all the compounds are consistent with the proposed structures. The 13C nmr spectra for the quinolones showed the presence of carbonyl carbon at 192194 ppm while the Omethoxy carbon appeared at 5659 ppm. The mass spectra of all the compounds showed molecular ion, M+, consistent with the molecular weight of the compounds but of varying intensities. The molecular ions of the chalcone, quinolones, quinolols were not the base peak ions but the molecular ion, M+, of the quinoline and the tetrahydroquinoline appeared as the base peak ions. It is therefore obvious that the quinoline and the tetrahydroquinolines are more stable than the starting materials, i.e. chalcone and the intermediate products, quinolones and quinolols.|Theses Collection|Quinoline/antimalarial/amodiaquine/antiamoebic/vioform/nalidixic/Skraup/2'aminochalcones/cyclocondensation/toluene suffonic.*||||||OYEGUNJU, Isiaka Akinloye.|M|A study of the use of corn chaff (eeri-ogi) as tablet distintegrant. ||||||M.Sc.|E.O.

Recently, there has been an increase in the demand for maize in food, pharmaceutical, brewing, malting and textile industries. Consequently, maize starch (used as disintegrant and binder in tableting) has become very expensive.  This has dictated the need to search for locally available raw materials that are not expensive for use as tablet  disintegrants in pharmaceutical dosage form design.Corn chaff (a bye product of Ogi preparation from maize) was prepared from Zea mays L. (streak resistant white type two). Various concentrations of the chaff were incorporated into tablet formulations using two drugs: paracetamol and chloroquine phosphate.  The disintegrant properties of the chaff as well as the effect of the mode of incorporation of the disintegrant were evaluated.The results of the physical properties of corn chaff relevant to good tablet disintegrating properties, when compared to maize starch showed that corn chaff has a good potential as a tablet disintegrant. The effect of disintegrant concentration (corn chaff and maize starch) on tablet properties was investigated. Tablets prepared with the two disintegrants were of uniform weight. For paracetamol tablets, changes in disintegrant concentrations led to changes in tablet crushing strength. For chloroquine phosphate tablets, change in disintegrant concentration had no statistically significant effect on tablet crushing strength.Tablet disintegration time decreased with increase in disintegrant concentration (corn chaff and maize starch) for chloroquine phosphate and paracetamol tablets. Increase in disintegrant concentration led to increase in dissolution rate of chloroquine phosphate tablets while the dissolution rate of paracetamol tablets seemed not to be affected appreciably by increase in disintegrant concentration.Change in the mode of incorporation of disintegrants from internal to internal/external and to complete external led to decrease in tablet crushing strength and disintegration times of paracetamol and chloroquine phosphate tablets in that order while the dissolution rate increased.  The shape of Wagner plot for the effect of mode of incorporation of disintegrant on dissolution rate of paracetamol and chloroquine phosphate tablets were also affected by change in the mode of incorporation of the disintegrant.  For the two disintegrant tested, external mode of incorporation showed superiority over the internal and the internal/external methods. Corn chaff performed as efficiently as maize starch as tablet disintegrants in the two drugs tested.|Theses Collection|cereal/dosage/Corn chaff/chloroquine phosphate/Wagner plot/drugs.*||||||OGUNTI, Erastus Olarewaju. |M|Establishment of pharmacopoeial standards for cassia alata and cassia podocarpa leaves. ||||||M.Phil.|A.A.

(Caesalpinaceae) growing well in Nigeria possessed laxative properties as a result of their content of anthraquinone derivatives.  The two plants are currently part of the list II plants of the OAU/STRC requiring further studies for the African Pharmacopoeia.  Toxicological studies on C. podocarpa showed close similarity with senna (C. acutifolia), an official laxative.  Since the bioactivity and toxicity had already been known, these Cassia species especially C. podocarpa would be qualified for standardization.Cassia alata and Cassia podocarpa were collected from four different locations during the dry and rainy seasons.  The leaves were dried at 55oC and powdered to give coarse and moderately fine powder grades.  The powders were stored in amber bottles in a cool dry place prior to analysis. Sections were cut from the fresh leaves for histological studies. The ash and extractive values were determined using standard methods.  The laxative activity, using Cassia acutifolia as reference, was evaluated.The results showed valuable diagnostic features in both the surface preparations and transverse sections of the leaf.  C. alata possessed a single row of palisade cells as compared to C. podocarpa with two layers of palisade cells.  Significant differences which will aid identification of the species and detection of adulteration in commercial samples also existed in the vein-islet and veinlet termination numbers, palisade ratio and stomatal indices.  Based on percentage wet faeces and at 500mg/kg, C. podocarpa possessed comparable laxative activity to sema in rat but possessed a much higher activity than C. alata.  At higher doses (above 500mg/kg) C. alata also showed significant laxative activity.  This suggested that C. alata could also be used as a laxative drug at much higher doses.  These results had supported the possibility of incorporating C. alata and C. podocarpa leaves as official drugs in the future edition of African Pharmacopoeia as a result to local drug production from these Cassia species.|Theses Collection|Cassia alata/Cassia podocarpa Guill/laxative/anthraquinone/Pharmacopoeia/Toxicological/palisade/stomatal indices/Cassia acutifolia *||||||BABI, Ebai Emmanuel. |M|The effect of specific hepatotoxins on biliary excretion of quinine.||||||M.Sc. |P.A.F.

For the chronic study some animals were pretreated with 0.25ml/Kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) twice weekly, at interval of four days, for eight weeks to induce cirrhosis. Whereas in the acute study other animals were pretreated with single doses of carbon, tetrachloride (0.5ml/Kg, i.p.) bromobenzene (1.6ml/Kg,i.p.) or allyl alcohol (0.025ml/Kg,i.p.] to generate toxic hepatitis.  Control animals were treated with equivalent dose of saline.  Quinine (10mg/Kg,i.p.) was given 24 hours prior to collection of bile and plasma. The urine collected within 24 hours of administering quinine as well as the bile and plasma were analyzed for quinine and its metabolises by High Performance Liquid Chromatographic method.BFR tended to be suppressed in all the hepatotoxintreated rats but the reduction was statistically significant (P < 0.05) with allyl alcohol alone.  Pretreatments with the hepatotoxins also caused an increase in QEB, though not statistically significant. However, judging from their metabolic ratios (i.e. unchanged quinineto  quinine metabolite ratios), there was significant decrease (P < 0.05) in metabolism of quinine in all pretreatment groups.The level of QEU or QRP was only significantly high (P < 0.05) in cirrhosis.  The metabolic ratios as measured from plasma samples also showed significant decrease (P < 0.05) in the metabolism of quinine in cirrhosis alone. However, metabolic ratios computed from the urine samples indicated significant decrease (P < 0.05) in quinine metabolism in all pretreatment groups. The results of this study suggest that reduction in hepatic biotransformation of drugs in pathological conditions of the liver, is associated with decrease in BFR: this in turn has important pharmacological and toxicological implications for drugs with very high biliary clearance.  Further clinical studies will be necessary to clarify this hypothesis. |Theses Collection|hepatotoxins/albino Wistar/plasma/cirrhosis/hepatitis/urine/metabolic/pharmacological and toxicological.*||||||OSONIYI, Rafiu Omolaja|M|Factors affecting the formation of prostaglandin-like compounds in cell-free extract of ocimum gratissimum (linn.) labiatae. ||||||M.Sc.  |F.D.

Little is however known about the from plant sources.  This study aims at out some of the factors affecting the biosynthesis of prostaglandinlike substances by Q. gratissimum leaf homozenate.  The factors include pH, buffer concentration and type of buffer.It is hoped that the results of this study will afford a comparison of the plant "prostaglandin synthetase" with prostaglandin synthetase from animal sources. Leaf homogenates prepared in TrisHCl and phosphate buffers of varying pH values and concentrations were incubated with 14CArachidonic acid in the presence of hydroquinone and reduced glutathione as cofactors, ethyl acetate extracts of the incubation mixtures were then subjected to column and ThinLayer Chromatographic analysis, using a liquid scintillation counter to measure radioactivity.Silicic acid column chromatography produced two radioactive product peaks, B and C which were combined and resolved by Thin Layer Chromatography into three components J, K and L corresponding to prostaglandins F, E and A respectively.  The greatest amount of prostaglandinlike compounds formation occurred at pH 7.0 in both buffers.  TLC analysis however revealed different pH optima for each of the components J, K and L. Using TrisHCl, optimum production of the PGElike product, K, occurred at pH 8.0, while optimum production of J, the PGFlike product occurred at pH 7.5. There was no appreciable difference in the amount of L, the PGAlike compound formed between pH 7.0 and 8.0. Using phosphate buffer, there were apparently two pH optima for the formation of each of the products J, K and L, one around pH 6.5 and the other at pH 8.0. When the buffer concentration was varied, the activity of the enzyme increased slightly with increasing TrisHCl concentration, while in phosphate, there was an optimum buffer concentration of 0.15M.These results indicate that the pH optimum for the formation of PGElike compounds in O. gratissimum is similar to that in animal tissues.  Furthermore, TrisHC1 buffer may be preferable to phosphate buffer for the formation of prostaglandinlike compounds by O. gratissimum leaf homogenate since it is possible to manipulate the pH of the buffer to favour the production of a particular kind of product and TrisHCl apparently does not inhibit this enzyme system.|Theses Collection|Prostaglanddin/biosynthesis/prostaglandinlike/homozenate/14CArachidonic/hydroquinone/glutathione/O. gratissimum/enzyme.*||||||AYODELE, Muyiwa Segun. |M|Cytogenetic and reproductive studies on some species of vernonia schrep (asteraceae) in Nigeria.  ||||||Ph.D.|Omotoye Olorode||Ile - Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Botany.|1992.|||OAU|||||xiii, 290p.|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

Data were assembled on the habit, habitat and community of the species of Vernonia. Measurements of relevant vegetative and reproductive characters were made. Meiotic and mitotic (including karyotypic) data were obtained from flower buds and roottips using standard squash techniques.  Photomicrographs were taken from good preparations. Hybridization studies were conducted on garden populations of some species. Some data on morphological attributes were subjected to appropriate statistical tests.The study shows that some species of Vernonia thrive in a number of habitats while others are restricted to some geographical locations. Vegetative and reproductive attributes are either peculiar to particular species and by the species in various habitats or they are peculiar to certain habitats cutting across various species found in the habitats; characters in the latter category are clearly convergent adaptive responses to the environment. Certain attributes which vary minimally between habitats were for taxonomic purposes.Fruit dispersal is mainly a colonization function.  The discrepancy between high seed production and scanty populations of some species is accounted for largely by seed wastage arising from non-availability of suitable germination sites.  The widely acclaimed high seed production in herbs is more of a function of the overall and cumulative production by plants in the community rather than by individual plants.  Adaptations for safety and variable dormancy of propagules were identified as important germination strategies in Vernonia.The chromosome numbers of V. perrottetti Sch. Bip., V. tenoreana Oliv., V. stenostegia (Stapf) Hutch & Dalz., V. kotschyana Sch. Bip., V. conferta Benth. (2n = 20) and V. ambigua Kotschy. & Peyr. (2n = 40) are reported for the first time.  Some karyotypic attributes correlated with certain vegetative and reproductive characters and these correlations exist irrespective of the growth-form differences.  The specialized attributes of herbs with lower chromosome number compared with the less specialized attributes in herbs with higher chromosome number, indicate that x = 9 basic number is more derived than x = 10.  A smaller chromosome number and heterogeneity in size of chromosomes are more correlated with derived characters than the smallness of size of chromosomes or the level of asymmetry of karyotype.The interaction of environmental factors among themselves and with organisms and the responses of genetic material, are two conditions responsible for the trends in the evolution of adaptive strategies in Vernonia. These two conditions, in Vernonia as in other natural groups, enable the identification of characters common to the genius, characters peculiar to particular species and characters which are products of similar adaptive responses of different species to particular selection pressures in the environment. These observations provide a synthetic appraisal of karyological, vegetative and reproductive characters in the selected species of Vernonia.|Theses Collection|Growth/ecological zones/Meiotic/mitotic data/hybridization/habitats/Vegetative reproduction/chromosome/morphological/genetic/ecology/Vernonia/taxonomic/Meiotic/mitotic/dormancy of propagules/chromosome/karyotypic/heterogeneity/asymmetry of karyotype. *||||||NWOKEOCHA, Chinyere Constance.|F|Botanical and cytogenetic studies of some African accessions of a wild rice (oryza punctata kotschy ex steud.).||||||M.Sc. |J.O.

Exploration in south-western Nigeria revealed the exclusive occurrence of tetraploid O. punctata in Ipetumodu, Moro, EdunAbon, Sekona and IleIfe. These populations were found in swampy locations under shade. The Ipetumodu population is however, thriving in a habitat made open by the activities of man. Observations over two seasons on this population revealed that regeneration is from rootstocks at the onset of the rains. There is also evidence to show that seedlings in open, flooded habitat have difficulty in establishing.  No diploid was found in all the populations sampled.Chromosome studies revealed normal meiosis with regular bivalent paring, suggesting that the polyploids are amphidiploids. Asynchrony of meiotic stages was observed in different anthers. diploids showed economy of pollen production, earlier maturity reduced biomass but high seed set. These characteristics show that they are rstrategists.  The distribution of ploidy levels showed that the diploid is widespread, the ranges of the diploids and tetraploids overlap with some degree of symparty, tetraploids have spread beyond the range of diploids. All these suggest that the tetraploid O. punctata is a young diploidscomplex.Based on the anatomical and morphological studies, seven indices were found to distinguish between diploid and tetraploid O.  punctata: leaf breadth  the leaves of diploid O. punctata are narrower (c. 1.5cm) than the leaves of polyploids (c. 1.9cm2.3cm); culm diameter  culms of diploids are generally thin (c. 0.3cm) while those of polyploids are broad (c. 0.4cm0.5cm); spikelet length and breadthspikelets of diploids are longer (c. 6mm7mm) with length: breadth ratio > 3 than in polyploids (c. 5mm6mm) with length: breadth ratio < 3; awn length--diploid awns are generally longer (c. 55mm84mm) than polyploid awns (c. 20mm30mm); basal cell of microhairs--basal cells are about twice the length of apical cells in diploids but only slightly longer in polyploids; prickle hairs are sparse in the intercostal zone of the diploids but are abundant in the intercostal zone of the tetraploids.  Short cells are abundant and mostly paired in the intercostal zone of diploids whereas they are sparse and mainly solitary in polyploids. From the agrobotanical studies, the potentials for the improvement of cultivated rice existing in O.  punctata are quite low.|Theses Collection|Oryza punctata Kotschy ex Steud/chromosome/foliar epidermal/Exploration/tetraploid/diploids/diploids/agrobotanical.*||||||UBOM, Rufus Matthias. |M|Structure and distribution of isoberlina craib and stapf woodlands in Kainji lake national park.||||||Ph.D.|A.O.

A centralline transect was laid in each belt transect and percentage canopy cover and grass basas cover were taken at every metrepoint along the transect.  Elevation, slope angle and slope direction were measured in each sampling plot.  Vegetation profiles were drawn for twelve plots chosen for soil study.  Soil pits were excavated and soil colour, concretion, consistence, structure root distribution and nature of boundary described.  Soil samlples from each horizon were collected, airdried, ground and analyses, for texture, pH, exchangeable acidity, organic carbon, exchangeable cations, available phosphorus and total nitrogen.Relationships between pairs of vegetation and environmental variables were analyzed by bivariate correlations. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to examine variation in vegetation, species relationships, and gradients in soil variables.  Variation in woody and grass species among plots was analyzed by analysis of variance.  Multiple regression analysis (MRA) was used to predict models for vegetation and species responses to environmental variables.  The patterns of joint structure between vegetation and environmental variables were investigated by canonical correlation analysis (CCA).Results showed that Isoberlinia woodlands had uniform structure.  They were made of almost the same woody and grass species with no statistically significant difference among plots in terms of taxonomic composition.  Woodland height increased down the slopes of ridges, and canopy cover was < 70%.  The undergrowth was sparse.  Soil texture varied between sandy loam and sandy clay loam with abundant concentrations.  Soil chemical properties showed variation in distribution: high on surface soils and low in subsoils.  Variation in some chemical properties (for example organic carbon and percent clay) correlated with density height, basal area and crown cover of Isoberlinia and associated species.  PCA of vegetation-environmental variables identified primary and secondary nutrient and topographical gradients to which Isoberlinia and its associates responded.  CCA defined the direction of variation in the structure of vegetation and species with environmental variables.  MRA gave predictive models for vegetation and responses of species to environmental factors.  It identified percentage silt, Mn, Fe, Na, slope direction and elevation as environmental gradients establishing and distributing Isoberlinia woodlands.  These gave information on the ecological optimum and amplitude of some species. The above accounts show that the structure, abundance and distribution of Isoberlinia woodlands are influenced by variation in soil and topographical properties.  Management of these woodlands should be considered as they provide wildlife refuge. |Theses Collection|lsoberlinia woodlands/plinthite/quartzite ridges/centralline/bivariate/taxonomic/subsoils/Isoberlinia/amplitude.*||||||AKINDAHUNSI, Afolabi Akintunde. |M|A study of the chemical causes of goitre in Akoko and Ilesa areas of South-Western Nigeria. ||||||Ph.D. |S.R.A.

Akoko and Ilesa (in Southwestern Nigeria) were chosen as study areas on the basis of earlier epidemiological studies indicating goitre endemia in Akoko, and Ilesa as control.Urine of subjects used in this study was analyzed for thiocyanate, iodine, urea and creatinine, while serum was analyzed for triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxinebinding globulin (TBG). Water samples collected from study areas (rain, streams and wells) were analyzed for iodine content. Both raw food types and typical meals of subjects were analyzed for iodine, % protein, gross energy, cyanide and glucosinolates.  Sample table salt was analyzed for iodine.The mean levels ( SEM) of the analytes were: Akungba: iodine (9.600.44 ug/dL), creatinitie (0.120.01 g/dL), thiocyanate (1.090.07 mg/dL), urea (1.230.11 g/dL), T3 (107.043.4lng/dL), T4 (7.090.33ug/dL), TSH (10.540.36 uU/ml) and TBG (35.263.24 ug/ml); Oke Agbe: iodine (8.210.94 ug/dL), creatinine (0.120.02 g/dL), thiocyanate (0.760.06mg/ dL), urea (0.820.11 g/dL), T3 (127.076.55ng/dL), T4 (8.780.70 ug/dL), TSH (7.590.35 uU/ml), and TBG (31.152.60 ug/ml); Ifewara: iodine (13.770.61 ug/dL), creatinine (0.120.Olg/dL), thiocyanate (0.550.05 mg/dL), urea (1.300.10 g/dL), T3 (192.835.34 ng/dL), T4 (10.990.45 ug/dL), TSH (4.450.26 uU/ml) and TBG (35.041.27 ug/ml); Erinmo: iodine (13.640.45 ug/dL), ceatinine (0.140.01g/dL),thiocyanate (0.740.08mg/dL), urea (1.220.08g/dL), T3 (132.764.43 ng/dL), T4  (11.840.77 ug/dL) TSH (3.340.37 uU/ml), and TBG (36.701.33 ug/ml).  The study confirmed significant regional variations in the urinary levels of iodine and thiocyanate while there was no significant regional difference in urea and creatinine levels.  Analysis of urinary iodine/thiocyanate ratio revealed that subjects from Akungba and Oke Agbe had abnormal conditions with values less than 7, the normal conditions.  Akungba and Oke Agbe had 30.6 and 24.6%, respectively, while Ifewara and Erinmo had 4.2 and 3.6%, respectively. For iodine/creatinine ratio, analysis further revealed that subjects from Akoko area had abnormal conditions; < 50.  Akunba and Oke Agbe had 14.3 and 29.2%, respectively, while Ifewara and Erinmo had 4.2 and 3.6%, respectively.  Urinary thiocyanate/creatinine ratio showed that Akoko area had values greater than 12.  Akungba and Oke Agbe had 42.4 and 25.0%, respectively, while Ifewara and Erinmo had 4.2 and 1.8%, respectively. Serum T3/T4 ration revealed that Akoko area had values greater than 25.  Akungba and Oke Agbe had 14.3 and 6.7%, respectively while Ifewara and Erinmo had 4.2 and 0.0%, respectively.  Values obtained for all the ratios analyzed would confirm goitre prevalence in Akoko area.Food analysis also revealed low iodine and protein intake in the study areas.  The mean iodine content ranged from 22.50 to 42.00 ug/kg while the mean % protein ranged from 2.44 to 5.27. Similarity in the iodine and protein in the two study areas, and the low consumption of cassava in Ilesa area which has low incidence of goitre, would implicate high cassava consumption in the prevalence of goitre in Akoko area.For the animal model used to confirm iodinedietary cyanideprotein synergism, animals on high cyanide, low iodine and protein, had bigger thyroid weights than the control. In addition, diets containing Amaranthus viridis, a highglucosinolate containing vegetable, had thyroid weights greater than the control.  Therefore, glucosinolate could be a factor in the Akoko goitre endemia since the Akoko area consume significantly higher Amaranthus viridis than the Ilesa area.|Theses Collection|goitre/epidemiological/thiocyanate, iodine, urea and creatinine/serum/triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxinebinding globulin (TBG)/cyanide/cyanideprotein synergism/Amaranthus viridis/glucosinolate.*||||||DUROSINMI, Lateefat Moyosore. |F|Synthesis, characterization and some properties of aminophosphonic acids.||||||Ph.D. |I.A.O.

The dipolar nature of the NAMPA series of acids and the surfactant activity of N8AMPA and N12AMPA were also investigated.Six of the NAMPA acids, NH2(CH2)nNHCH2PO3H2 (n = 2,3,4,6,8,12) were synthesized by condensing chloromethylphosphoric acid with the corresponding diaminoalkanecompound. The syntheses of the aminoalkanephosphonic acids, (NAPA), NH2(CH2)nPO3H2 (n = 2,3), were carried out by reacting triethylphosphite with Nbromoalkylamine hydrobromide in alcoholic sodium hydroxide followed by hydrolysis. The glycine analogue, aminomethylphosphonic acid, (NH2CH2PO3H2) was prepared by esterifying chloromethylphosphonic acid with  triethylorthoformate, condensing the ester with potassium phthalimide followed by acid hydrolysis. The acids were characterised using infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, chemical methods (by derivatization with phenylisocyanate) and macroscopic physical methods such as melting point and conductivity.  Elucidation of the possible coordination sites with metals, composition of the metal complexes as well as possible structures of the metal complexes of both NAMPA and NAPA were investigated using ultraviolet/visible spectro photometry, infrared spectroscopy, potentiometry and conductometry.  The pKa profiles for the NAMPA and their Nphenylurea derivatives were obtained from potentiometric titrations while the surfactant activity of the higher homologues was determined by conductometry.Aminophosphonic acids are white crystalline compounds with high melting points.  They are soluble in water, dilute hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. The yields of the phenylisocyanate derivatives were moderately high (6070%). Series of absorption curves, elemental analysis and infrared spectra data indicating the complexing abilities of NAMPA and NAPA were obtained.  The results show that N2 and N3AMPA form complexes with metal ions in the ratios 1:l and l:2 in aqueous solution as well as in the solid state.  Similarly, aminopropylphosphonic acids, (N3APA), gave the 1:2 complex.  N4AMPA and N6AMPA gave a moleratio of 1:4 (metalAMPA).  The infrared spectra, conductance measurements, nonderivatization of the metal complexes with  phenylisocyanate confirm that the N-AMPA acids, NH2(CH2)nNHCH2PO3H2 act as bidentate ligards via the two nitrogen atoms.On the other hand, the phosphonate group seems to be involved in the coordination of the NAPA acids, NH2(CH2)nPO3H2, to the central metal ion.  Potentiometric titrations carried out on NAMPA and their Nphenylurea derivatives confirm that they are zwitterionic in nature with pKa ranging from 3.2 to 11.8.  For the Nphenylurea derivatives, the pKa values are lower. The critical micelle concentration (c.m.c.) of N12AMPA has a lower value than that of N-8-AMPA and the addition of substrate (urea and sodium benzoate) increases the c.m.c. The implication of these results is that the aminophosphonic acids are potential analytical chelating agents which can be used to detect and estimate metal ions in solution.|Theses Collection|aminophosphonic/aminoalkylaminomethanephoshoric/chloromethylphosphoric/diaminoalkane/Elucidation/spectroscopy, potentiometry and conductometry/surfactant/Aminophosphonic/Nphenylurea.*||||||FADIRAN, Amos Olutola.|M|Micellization of triton x-100 and its catalysis of the aquation of some iron (II) phenanthroline complexes in nonaqueous solvents.|||||| Ph.D.|W.J.

Results obtained thereof can be used to predict likely influence of both the additives and surfactant on similar systems, and extended to the possibility of employing them to enhance the shelf-lives of some drugs.The critical micelle concentrations (c.m.c) of Triton X-100 were determined with the aid of an Abbee Refractometer.  Spectrophotometric techniques were used to obtain the kinetic data.  All readings were taken at a controlled temperature of 250.1oC.  The c.m.c. of Triton X-100 was determined in acetone dopped with substrate free water and water containing Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), Sulphuric acid (H2SO4), Urea ((NH2)2CO) and sodium benzoate (C6H5COONa), as substrate in separate runs.  The c.m.c. versus [substrate] profiles of Triton X-100 in acetone in substrate free H2O and in aqueous NaOH, H2SO4 are similar, decreasing non-linearly with c.m.c. at low [substrate], and approaching saturation at higher [substrate].  However, the c.m.c. - [substrate] profiles in the presence of Urea and Sodium benzoate are structured, exhibiting a minium at low [substrate] <= 1.0 x 10-4 but invariant at high [substrate] >= 5.0 x 10-4 mol.dm-3.Log(c.m.c) decreases linearly with increasing E, suggesting formation of bigger micelles in solvents of higher dielectric constants.  Similar correlations of Grunwald's constant, the f' - factor and the vapour pressure with log(c.m.c.) show a linear decreases in conformity with the E-log(c.m.c.) profile. The Ky - [surfactants] (% v/v) profiles for the aquation of the complexes in acetone and ethylene glycol show the characteristic features of micelle-catalysed reactions. Maximum catalytic factors: Ky(max)/Ky(min):, of 3.5 x 103, 198.3 and 162.2 are obtained for the aquation of Fe(Ph2Phen)32+,Fe(Me2Phen)32+ and Fe(Me4Phen)32+ respectively in acetone, while the values for the same complexes in ethylene glycol are 14.0; 24.0 and 5.6 respectively.  Observed catalysis is attributed to premicellar activities, micellar evolution, and the reduced mobility as well as the suitable orientation of both the complex and water molecules in the micellar water pool of Triton X-100 in these media.Aquation rates of Fe(Ph2Phen)3 in acetone are enhanced by H2O, C6H5COONa and NaOH as additives, while they are inhibited by H2SO4, (NH2)2CO and Na2SO4.  Aquation rates of the complexes which are generally (Ca:103 - fold) faster in acetone than in water, are attributable to the evolution of different micellar types and aquation mechanisms.  Generally, aquation rates were also found to be dependent on complex hydrophobicity.|Theses Collection|additives/surfactant/micellization of Triton X-100/Iron (II) phenanthroline/critical micelle concentrations (c.m.c)/Abbee Refractometer/Spectrophotometric/Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH)/Sulphuric acid (H2SO4)/Urea ((NH2)2CO)/sodium benzoate (C6H5COONa)/hydrophobicity.*||||||IKHIDE, Priscilla Onoiribholo|F|Absorption and fluorescence studies of some 6-alkyl-2-naphthols self-assembly monolayers on solid substrate.||||||M.Sc. |C.A.

The objective includes the synthesis of 6-alky-2-naphtols on quartz glass by spontaneous self-assembly method, the measurement of the absorption and flourescence spectra of the films to give information on how the luminescent properties of 2-naphthol have been modulated by the alkyl chains and the liquid crystalline phase in which it is situated.Friedel  Crafts acylatation of 2methoxynaphthalene, followed by HuangMinlon reduction of the resulting 6acyl2methoxynaphthalene gave 6alkyl2methoxynaphthalene. 6alkyl2naphthols were finally obtained by demethylation of 6alkyl2methoxynaphthalenes.Observed contact angles of water on the films were interpreted as arising from the presence of hydroxyl groups exposed on the surface ofthe films. This proposition is supported by the results obtained from the ellipsometric measurement of film thickness, which showed that the films were multilayers.

The objective was to study the physical properties of new compounds (10-hydroxyoctadecanoates and 9,10dihydroxy octadecanoates of lead, zinc, cadmium and mercury) with a view to examining their usefulness as materials with potential  technological applications.10hydroxyoctadecanoic acid was first prepared by the oxidation of cis9Octadecenoic (oleic) acid and this was subsequently used to prepare the carboxylates of lead, zinc, cadmium and mercury.  The electrical conductances of the salts were measured as functions of temperature in a cell made of platinum. The thermograms of all the samples were obtained with a PerkinElmer Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC7) calibrated with indium metal. The temperature, enthalpy and entropy of phase transformation for lead, zinc, cadmium and mercury 10hydroxyoctadecanoates and 9,10dihydroxyoctadecanoates were obtained.  The discussion on the Differential Scanning Calorimetric (DSC) data was facilitated by the visual observation of the melting behaviour of the salts on an optical microscope.The plot of logarithm of conductivity against inverse absolute temperature was found to be linear for zinc(II) 10hydroxyoctadecanoate while a similar plot for lead(II) 10hydroxyoctadecanoate showed a maximum. The maximum was interpreted in terms of the interaction of lead ions with the hydroxyl groups of the carboxylate chains.  The same Arrhenius plot for cadmium(II) 10hydroxyoctadecanoate showed a discontinuity and this was explained to arise from exhibition of phase transition by the salt. The DSC thermogram and the optical observation on a polarising light microscope confirmed this deduction. Cadmium and mercury dihydroxyoctadecanoates appeared to pass through solid  > solid phases which then transformed to mesophases before they eventually melted into the liquid phase.  Zinc dihydroxyoctadecanoate melted directly to the liquid state but the cooling process produced an intermediate solid phase that the DSC distinguished to be different from the initial solid phase.  All the metal 10 hydroxyoctadecanoates studied except cadmium melted directly to the liquid phase. Some intermediate mesophases were found to be sufficiently stable over a fairly wide temperature range to merit their uses as liquid crystals for possible technological applications.Comparison of the results of these studies with the existing data on metal carboxylates suggested that it is not practical at the moment to predict the melting mechanism of these systems and the need for the systematic study of their phase behaviour is recommended.|Theses Collection|carboxylate/conductance/enthalpy/entropy/10hydroxyoctadecanoic/cis9Octadecenoic (oleic)/PerkinElmer Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC7)/polarising light microscope/Zinc dihydroxyoctadecanoate/ melting mechanism*||||||ODUNUSI, Adepeju Olubamwo.|M|Isolation and characterization of some diterpenoids from Euphorbiaceae family.||||||Ph.D.  |C.O.

The biological activities of this family are attributed to their diterpenoid constituents.  This study was therefor designed to isolate and characterise diterpenoids from some species of the Euphorbiaceae.  Latex of Euphorbia lateriflora Schum. & Thonn. and root bark of Euphorbia kamerunica Pax were collected at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife while the root bark of Euphorbia poisonii Pax was collected along Ilorin-Jebba Road in Kwara State.The latex and the root bark were extracted with methylated spirit and extract partitioned into the petroleum spirit and ether fractions.  These fractions were then subjected to column and multiple preparative thin layer chromatography.  The pure compounds isolated were analysed using infra-red spectroscopy and proton and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Four compounds were isolated from the latex of Euphorbia lateriflora. These are new jatrophane-like diterpenoids. A pentacyclic triterpenoid gult-5-en-3/B-ol was isolated from the root bark of Euphorbia kamerunica and the root bark of Euphorbia poisonii also gave another triterpenoid, butyrospermol.

The study areas covered are Oyo, Ondo, Osun, Ogun, Lagos and Delta states.  Water samples were collected during December 1990 to July 1991. Phthalate esters in all these simples were determined using Liquidliquid extraction, column chromatographic and gas chromatographic analytical techniques. Extraction of samples were carried out using dichloromethane as the extractant. The sample extracts were concentrated and run through alumina adsorbent column. Elution efficiencies of eluates on alumina adsorbent was determined using several solvents. The concentrate was first 'cleanedup' by washing with nhexane to remove all free hydrocarbon contaminants.  Phlthalate esters were then eluted from the column using appropriate solvent after trial with the following solvent and solvent mixture: 100% benzene, 100% ethylacetate and benzene:ethyl acetate mixture 95:5 (v/v); 50:50 (v/v) and 5:95 (v/v) respectively. 100% ethyl acetate gave the best result.Generally, all the water samples analysed contain abundance of phthalate esters.  Dimethyl, Diethyl and Dibutyl phthalates (UMP, DEP and DBP) were identified among other phthalates. Rivers in Ogun state contain an overall mean of DMP 129.04  34.54 mg/l, DEP 121.70  23.60 mg/l and DBP 152.47  40.21 mg/l and a range of (89.66  154.20 mg/l, 96.12  126.33 mg/l and 125.73  198.71 mg/l for DMP, DEP and DBP respectively.  The phthalate esters level in Ondo state ranged from 21.43  70.42 mg/l, 22.88  328.80 mg/l and 103.24  1472.52 mg/l for DMP, DEP and DBP respectively to give an overall mean of DMP 49.35  25.20 mg/l, 140.75  64.59 mg/l DEP and 523.59  64.85 mg/l DBP.While average values of 270.61  18.06 mg/l DMP, 143.62  85.50 mg/l DEP and 651.38  43.99 mg/l DBP and a range of (138.30  462.24 mg/l DMP, 71.11  265.00 mg/l DEP and 52.73  1381.46 mg/l DBP) were obtained for Rivers in Oyo and Osun states, rivers of Lagos and Delta states gave overall means of 64.97  53.06 mg/l DMP, 170.26  20.80 mg/l DEP and 311.61  35.85 mg/l DBP. The levels of their phthalates ranged from (18.52  119.95 mg/l, 26.52  538.10 mg/l and 9.82  293.73 mg/l) for DMP, DEP and DBP respectively.The levels of phthalates obtained for treated waters of SouthWestern  Nigeria  191.10  105.90 mg/l DMP, 417.60  35.69 mg/l DEP and 637.85  50.69 mg/l DBP are indications that drinking waters also contain abundance of phthalate esters.

The complexes were synthesised by known methods and charaterised by U.VVisible spectra.  The kinetics studies were investigated using SP8400 U.VVisible Pye Unicam spectrophotometer. Rate constant  (ky)  [SDS]T profiles obtained using this model showed good agreement with experimental data.  There was excellent agreement between the equilibrium constants derived from kinetic data and Scatchard plots.  Inhibition was observed for the aquation of Fe(Me4phen)32+ in both alkaline and acidic media contrary to the overall catalysis observed for Fe(phen)32+ in acidic medium. The inhibition factors ranging from 2.0  9.8 were obtained in the presence of added salts.The aquation reaction was controlled by the micelle-Iron(II) conplex interaction. The bound Fe(II) complex is better stabilised with respect to dissociation in neutral medium as shown by the comparatively higher value of the binding constant in this medium.  In Fe(Me4phen)32+, the binding constant was 5.00 x 105 dm3 moll   in neutral medium while it was 4.05 x 104 and 1.20 x 105 dm6 mol-2 in alkaline and acidic media respectively. In Fe(pheri)32+ the binding constant was 1.70 x 104 dm3 mol-1 in neutral medium while in alkaline and acid media it was 1.30 x 104 and 3.06 x 105 dm6 mol-2 respectively.  The higher value in acidic medium is a reflection of the inaccurate fit of the model at low SDS concentration for Fe(phen)32+. The rate constant (ky) increased with increase in electrolyte concentration due to increase in dielectric constant of the system. This decreased the hydrophobicity leading to a corresponding decrease in the binding constants.  There is a direct correlation between the hydrophobicity of Fe(II) complex and the binding constant. Pre-critical micelle concentration association constant (Km)  decreases with salt concentration.  Km values varied from 1.32 x 104  4.47 x 106 in the presence of SO4 while in benzoate, it varied from 2.70  4.47 x 106. B, the equilibrium constant for the binding between Fe(phen)32+ and SDS varied from 7.82 x 108  4.77 x 1010 dm3 mol1 in SO42, 1.58 x 105  4.80 x 107  dm3 mol-1  in C6H5COO, 0.87 x 102  2.00 x 105 dm3 mol-1 in (But)4N+, 3.89 x 102  4.27 x 102 dm3 mol-1 in Mc4N+ and 4.78 x 104  6.31 x 102 dm3 mol-1 NH4+ as the concentrations of the ions decreases. The structure in the ky  [SDS]T profiles is due to favourable thermodynamic/ hydrophobicitic/ electrostatic binding between Fe(II) complex and SDS monomer aggregates coupled with the decrease in activity of water in the micellar phase.The extinction coefficients of the bound micelle-Fe(II) intermediate were found to be 19, 900, 19200 and 18,700 mol-1 dm3 cm-1 in neutral, 1.00 x 10-4H+ and 1.00 x 103 OH- media respectively.  The rate constants for the formation of micelle -  Fe(II) intermediates were 1.22 x 102 S1 (neutral medium), 3.11 x  x 102 S1(1.00 x 104 mol dm-3 H+) and 2.30 x 103 S1(1.00 x 103 mol dm-3OH-).  The corresponding reverse rate constant    (k1) for the dissociation of the intermediate to give an unbound metal complexes were 2.44 x 108 S1 (neutral medium), 2.59 x 107 S1 (1.00 x 104 mol dm-3 H+) and 5.11 x 108 S1 (1.00 x 103 mol dm-3OH-).|Theses Collection|micellar catalysis/ SP8400 U.VVisible Pye Unicam/binding constant/electrolyte concentration/dielectric constant/hydrophobicity/thermodynamic*||||||MAZA, Danjuma Dan-Adam|M|application of solid state nuclear track detection to uranium/thorium estimation in rocks and biological samples.||||||M.Sc.|F.A.N.

These trails, the density of which is a measure of the flux of the nuclear  particles and so of the concentration of the nuclides generating the particles, can be revealed by chemical etching or by viewing the dielectric materials with an electron microscope. The purpose of the present study is to develop this technique of solid state nuclear track detection locally and to employ it in the estimation of uranium and thorium concentrations in local rocks, guava fruits and beans seeds. The rocks and the biological samples used in this work were collected from tin mines and areas surrounding tin mines respectively in SabongidaKanar and Barakin Ladi, Jos Plateau. Some background rock samples were also collected from IleIfe, Nigeria.  Each sample was ground to a fine powder and pressed into pellets.  For rock samples, polyethyene oxide powder was used as a binder.  The alpha particles emitted by natural uranium and thorium in a sample and in a standard glass were recorded by LR115 cellulose nitrate detector films placed in intimate contact with the alpha emitters.  After chemical etching, the alpha track densities due to sample and standard glass were evaluated by visual counting under an optical microscope.  A comparison of these track densities and a knowledge of the uranium and thorium concentrations in the glass standard permitted the concentrations in the samples to be deduced.  The evaluation of the track densities by visual counting was found to be very tedious, timeconsuming and prone to error. Therefore for further development of this technique, a jumping spark counter was constructed and made operational.  The counter permits an automatic counting of the nuclear tracks in a thin solid state detector in a few seconds. The working characteristics of the counter was determined by counting, both visually and with.the counter, the tracks of fission fragments recorded by Makrofol KG solid state nuclear track detectors.  A detailed analysis of the operational modes of the counter was carried out  using the method of Laplace transform.The combined concentrations of the uranium and thoriurn in the samples analysed were found to be in the range 4 to 42 ppm by weight.  This applies to samples from the Jos Plateau and from IleIfe.  These results suggest that there is apparently no serious radiation hazard from the radioactivities of the rocks and biological materials around the tin mines of the Jos Plateau.|Theses Collection|chemical etching/electron microscope/uranium/thorium concentrations/fission fragments/Makrofol KG solid state nuclear track detectors/Laplace transform/radioactivities*||||||ADEYEMI, Gabriel Oladapo.|M|Highway geotechnical properties of laterised residual soils in the Ajebo-Ishara geological transition zone of Southwestern Nigeria.||||||Ph.D.|B.

Although the study particularly focussed in the influences of the pedogenic factors of parent rock and topography on the geochemistry, mineralogy and the engineering properties of the soils, it was also aimed at establishing the geotechnical basis for the stability of flexible highway pavenment in the study area.Topographical and geological mappings were done in order to isolate sampling localities.  Clay mineral analysis of soils collected from test pits was carried out through X-ray diiffractometry while the major elements' geochemistry was done using Xray fluorescence spectrometer.  Geotechnical tests such as grain size distribution, plasticity, compaction, California Bearing Ratio (CBR) and unconfined compression tests were carried out using the British Standard procedure 1377.     The investigations have shown that the major elements' geochemistry, clay mineralogy and engineering properties of the studied soils were controlled by the soilforming factors of parent rock and topography. For instance, the amount of kaolinite varied from about 54% in sandstone-derived soil to about 95% in quartzschistderived soil. The amount of ferric oxide also varied from about 7% in sandstonesoils and quartzschistsoils to 16.28% in migmatitegneisssoil.  Higher percentages of kaolinite and ferric oxide were found in soils along gentle slopes than in those along flat sites in most of the studied soils. This explains why soils along gentle slopes are less plastic than those in flat sites.  The soils are generally wellgraded with the amount of fines ranging from about 18% in quartzschistderived soils to about 74% in migmatitegneissderived soils.While a weak positive correlation of 0.004 was established between the amount of kaolinite and ferric oxide, a negative correlation of 0.58 was found between the percentage kaolinite and silicasesquioxide ratio.  Both the amount of ferric oxide and kaolinite showed positive correlations (0.24 and 0.29 respectively) with strength in term of CBR. Based on the values of conpaction parameters, amount of degradation of grains and strengths of compacted soils, the American Association of State Highways and Transportation Officials level was adjudged to be more suitable than the West African level for compacting each genetic soil studied.The degree of stability of the flexible highway pavement in the study area was found to increase with the kaolinite content (51.62% in unstable and 87.91% in stable zone), kaoliniteillite ratio (14.62 in unstable and 23.63 in stable zone), CBR (5.2% in unstable and 26.3% in stable zone) and unconfined compressive strengths of the foundation soils. Implicit in this study is the direct relevance of a knowledge of clay mineralogical assemblage of lateritic soils by highway engineers prior to the design of stable roads.|Theses Collection|migmatitegneiss/quartzschist/pedogenic factors/geotechnical basis/X-ray diiffractometry/kaolinite/migmatitegneissderived/silicasesquioxide ratio/lateritic soils*||||||ALI, Mohammed Sarki|M|Determination of regional velocity structure and interpretation of surface seismic data over Northwest Port-Harcourt.||||||M.Sc.|M.A. Olorunniwo||Ile - Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,  Geology & Applied Geophysics|1992|||OAU |||||xv, 230p.||||||| English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

Twentyfive, sixteenfold coverage seismic records of five seconds twoway reflection time, of lengths ranging from 9.8 kilometres to 29.0 kilometres, covering an area of about 500 square kilometres were mapped into four major horizons bounding five layers.  DixKrey equations were used in obtaining the seismic formation velocities and thicknesses of the layers encountered in the area.The study of Isochron maps of the surfaces of the layers reveal a central ridge in the NESW direction in addition to the regional southward dip. The Isopach maps indicate layering of beds with thickening, lensing and unconformities.  The structural analysis of the study area shows a subsurface structure which is elongated ridge striking approximately NE  SW with two major fault trends:  NW  SE and E  W respectively. The result of the velocity studies show a velocity character which increases with depth.  The velocity increases gradually from 2,200 m/s at 2100 metres depth to about 7,000 m/s at 7,000 metres depth. Also, there are lateral velocity variations with large scale velocity anomalies which could be due to lithology, facie changes, or depth related.  Layer2 at an average depth of 2,800 metres show a lateral variation from 2,200 m/s to 4,500 m/s.  Layer3 at an average depth of 3,750 metres has an interval velocity range of 2,500 m/s to 6,400 m/s.  Layer4 at an average depth of 5,000 metres has an interval velocity range of 3,800 m/s to 7,000 m/s.  The velocity anomalies are used to delineate changes in subsurface lithology and existence of possible hydrocarbon saturated formations.  The results of the velocity and structural analyses have been interpreted to determine characteristic hydrocarbon trapping mechanisms in the area.|Theses Collection|Seismic Common Depth Point (CDP)/DixKrey equations/hydrocarbon trapping mechanisms/Isopach/hydrocarbon association/geologic structures*||||||BABALOLA, Lamidi Olabode.|M|Micropaleontological study of Konko-1 and Obokun-3 wells, Western Niger Delta.||||||M.Sc. |M.B.

The study was aimed at determining the ages of sediments, stratigraphic ranges of foraminiferal and palynomorph taxa present in these wells and also to attempt biostratigraphic zonation, infer the depositional environments and correlate the penetrated strata.Seventyseven samples were processed for Foraminifera and thirtyseven shaly samples of these were processsed for palynomorphs using standard foraminiferal and palynological sample processing techniques respectively.  The recovered Foraminifera and Palynomorphs were studied with the aid of relevant microscopes and literature materials.  On the basis of the physical characteristics and log characters of the sediments in the penetrated intervals, three informal lithological units denoted A,B and C which are correlative with the Benin, Upper and Lower Agbada Formations respectively were delineated.Thirty-five planktonic and three hundred benthonic foraminiferal species were identified.  Based on the diverse foraminiferal species, four planktonic foraminiferal zones ranging from the N16 to Nl9 Zones of Blow (1969, 1979) and three informal benthonic foraminiferal zones were established. The planktonic foraminiferal zones from the base to the top are: Globorotalia acostaensis (N16), Globorotalia dutertrei/Globorotalia plesiotumida (N17), Globorotalia margaritae (N18) and Globigerina nepenthes (Nl9) Zones whilst the informal benthonic foraminiferal zones are: Lenticulina limbosus/Uvigerina peregrina, Florilus incisus/Nonion bouanum and Amphistegina gibbosa/Amiphstegina radiata zones. One broad palynological zone, the Amphistegina gibbosa/Amiphstegina radiata zone of Germeraad et al (1968) which is  divided into two informal subzones, the Echiperiporites estelae and  Laeviqatosporites sp.  Zones was also recognized.  The recognition of these foraminiferal and palynological zones assigns a Late Miocene to Early Pliocene age to the penetrated strata of these wells.The environmental interpretations deduced from the lithological characters, foraminiferal and palynomorph associations of the studied intervals showed that the sediments of Konko1 and Obokun3 wells were deposited in environments ranging from continental to the lower bathyal. The paleotemperature of the sea during the Late Miocene to Pliocene in this part of the Western Niger Delta was estimated to be in the range of 18.3oC to 20.2oC.  This indicates warm water environments.|Theses Collection|foraminiferal and palynological investigations/biostratigraphic zonation/penetrated strata/Globorotalia acostaensis (N16)/Globorotalia dutertrei/Globorotalia plesiotumida (N17)/Globorotalia margaritae (N18)/Globigerina nepenthes (Nl9)/Lenticulina limbosus/Uvigerina peregrina/Florilus incisus/Nonion bouanum/Amphistegina gibbosa/Amiphstegina radiata/Amphistegina gibbosa/Amiphstegina radiata/Echiperiporites estelae and  Laeviqatosporites sp/palynological/Miocene to Early Pliocene/lithological/foraminiferal and palynomorph/Konko1 and Obokun3/bathyal.*||||||ENIKANSELU, Pius Adekunle. |M|Inversion of seismic traveltime data over Oredo field, Niger Delta area of Nigeria.  ||||||M.Sc.|M.A. Olorunniwo.||Ile - Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,  Geology & Applied Geophysics|1992.|||OAU||||| xvi, 177p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

The Dix velocity analysis reveal both velocity increase with depth as well as velocity inversion. Interval velocity structure can be grouped into three: 19242215 m/s; 2286-4068 m/a and 26603700  m/s corresponding to sand with shale intercalations, sandstone with shale alternations and dominant shale respectively. The lateral variation in velocity are attributable to facies changes.The well logs comprising lithologic and porosity tools were subjected to both qualitative and quantitative analysis. The preliminary comparison tests of formation water resistivity quotient, formation factor quotient and porosity quotient yield corresponding values of 1.19, 17.86, and 0.62, for well 7 and 7.97, 335.42, and 0.32 for well 3 which indicate hydrocarbon presence at depth intervals 2450 and 2630 metres for well 7, and 2140 and 2340 metres for well 3. The confirmatory resistivity ratio tests revealed a moveable hydrocarbon saturation upto 0.75, 0.97 and 0.60 for wells 7, 3 and 4 respectively.The sonic logs were integrated to yield the timedepth curves for seismic wave propagation in the area. The constructed timedepth curves for seismic wave propagation in the area show a largely linear relation with depth in the twoway traveltime range 0.44 to 2.68 seconds which was extrapolated to total depth (TD) using nearsurface Dix velocities. The traveltime inversion results demonstrate the reliability of accurate prediction of seismic horizons from borehole information.|Theses Collection|seismic/Oredo field/latitude 5oN and longitude 5.5oE/geologic/extrapolate velocity/lithologic/resistivity quotient.*||||||IDOWU, Olufemi Abiola. |M|An assessment of groundwater in Ogun State.||||||M.Sc. |J.O.

Eightytwo of the 234 boreholes studied are located in the basement terrains, the others are located in the sedimentary terrain.Overburden thicknesses, aquifer depths and thicknesses and the types of aquifers and aquifer conditions are studied using the available borehole lithologic logs. Total borehole depths, static water levels, well yields, groundwater quality and transmissivity values are analysed.  Statistical analyses are presented in the form of ranges, averages, tables and figures with the aims of understanding and finding representative values for well and aquifer properties in both the basement and sedimentary terrain of Ogun State.Transmissivity values are analysed using 3 methods: Theis curve matching, Theis recovery and CooperJacob graphical methods.  Transmissivity values computed for aquifers located in the basement using these methods range from 1.60 - 5.76 m2 day-1, 1.46  2.68 m2  day-1 and 0.61  7.40 m2 day-1 respectively. For aquifers located in the sedimentary rocks, transmissivity values calculated using the 3 methods range from 6.10  16.85 m2 day-1,  0.53  1130.65 m2 day-1 and 0.43  33.72 m2 day-1 respectively.  Storage coefficients could not be calculated because there were no observation wells in the study area. The main source of groundwater in Ogun State is from precipitation.  The average annual precipitation computed for Ogun State is 1314 mm  155 mm, and about 12 percent of the annual rainfall in Ogun State goes into the ground to replenish groundwater annually.  Generally in Ogun State, the yields of wells in areas underlain by basement rocks are lower than the yields of wells in areas underlain by sedimentary rocks. Yields of wells in areas underlain by basement rocks range from 0.40  36.3 m3 hr-1 with an average of 6.53 m3 hr-1.  Yields of wells in areas underlain by sedimentary rocks range from 0.40  181.61 m3 hr-1 with an average yield of 30.90 m3 hr-1.  The boreholes that tapped the alluvial deposits have the highest average yield of 40.32 m3 hr-1  24  m3 hr-1.  The average yield of wells that tapped Ewekoro formation is the lowest; 20.13 m3 hr-1  17.50 m3 hr-1. Groundwater of Ogun State is good for most domestic agricultural and industrial usages. From consideration of water use based on 0.0045 m3  day-1  to 0.027 m3  day-1  from rural to urban setting and water quality, there is enough groundwater in the basement and sedimentary terrains of Ogun State that can adequately serve the domestic needs of the majority of the people of the State. |Theses Collection|sedimentary terrains/aquifer depths/lithologic logs/transmissivity/CooperJacob graphical methods/sedimentary rocks range from 0.40  181.61 m3 hr-1/alluvial.*||||||KOLA-OJO, Olumuyiwa Olubusuyi. |M|A study of seismic hydrocarbon indicators over Obodo area in Niger Delta. ||||||M.Sc.  |M.A. Olorunniwo.||Ile - Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Geology & Applied Geophysics|1992. |||OAU||||| xiii, 258p.|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

Seven faults and four seismic horizons (at depths of about 1300m, 1760m, 2900m and 3260m respectively) were picked. These horizons divide the study area into five layers Layer 1 is the Benin Formation, layers 2, 3 and 4 constitute the Agbada Formation and layer 5 is the Akata Formation.  Layer 1 has a thickness of about 1300m.  Layer 2 has a thickness range of 440m to 720m and an interval velocity range of 2200m/s to 2600m/s.  Layer 3 ranging in thickness from 760m to 1440m has an interval velocity varying from 2700m/s to 3500m/s.  The thickness of layer 4 varies from 500m to 900m and its interval velocity ranges from 3000m/s to 4600m/s.  Layer 5 extends from a depth of about 3260m downwards.The isopach maps of layers 2 and 3 show a general increase in the thickness from the northeastern to the southwestern direction.  This implies that the layers generally dip towards the southwest.  Layer 4 thickens towards the west and east directions from the central part of the area. This signifies a contemporaneous deposition of the layer with the growth of the anticlinal structure in the area.  With the aid of the isochron and interval velocity maps, possible hydrocarbon zones within layers 2, 3 and 4 were indicated.Two sands  the upper and lower sands  with average thickness of 200m and 400m respectively were identified as the potential oil reservoirs of the entire study area.  The upper sand occurs within layer 3 while the lower sand is found in layer 4. The study of amplitude, velocity and reflectivity of the sands as seismic hydrocarbon indicators, show that part of the sands were presented as relatively strong amplitude reflections on the seismic sections with their velocities and reflectivities varying widely.The interval and fluid velocities of the upper sand vary from 2400m/s to 3400m/s and 800m/s to 1800m/s respectively.  Reflectivities of the top and bottom of the sand range from 0.01 unit to 0.06 unit and 0.01 unit to 0.10 unit respectively. The interval and fluid velocities of the lower sand vary from 3000m/s to 4600m/s and 1200m/s to 2300m/s respectively.  Reflectivity of the sand range from 0. 01 unit to 0.14 unit at the top and 0.04 unit to 0.22 unit at the bottom.Based on this study, part of the northern and southern sections of the area were delineated as possible hydrocarbon producing zones of the two sands and hence of the entire area. This was confirmed by the numerous oil wells located within these delineated zones.  More oil wells are therefore recommended within these zones especially on the lower sand where only one well has so far been drilled.|Theses Collection|seismic/geophysical logs/hydrocarbon/ isopach maps/anticlinal structure/isochron/Reflectivity.*||||||OKOH, Andrew Fabian. |M|Source rock evaluation and oil-source rock correlation in Parabe-35 and Mina-3 wells, Niger Delta. ||||||M.Sc. |J.I.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate shales of the two wells for their source rock potential and correlate crude oils from these wells with their possible source rocks. The samples were analysed by standard organic geochemical techniques which include chemical analysis of shales, petrographic study of isolated kerogens and gas chromatographic analysis of nalkanes of shale extracts and crude oils.Total organic carbon, soluble organic matter, saturated hydrocarbons and genetic potential for Parabe-35 shales range respectively from 0.9  4.3%, 4983228 ppm, 12112163 ppm and 0.6-5.76 mg/g, while the corresponding values for Mina3 shales are 0.64.0%, 5393487 ppm, 1401838 ppm, and 0.455.73 mg/g. These values show that the hales contain adequate organic matter and qualify as good oil and gas source rocks.Organic petrography of the kerogens shows that amorphous, terrestial and recycled organic matter vary respectively from 4671%, 2952% and 27% for Parabe35 shales, and from 4774%, 2648% and 15% for Mina3 shales.  A plot of whole rock hydrogen index against oxygen index on a Van Krevelen  type diagram shows the dominance of type III organic matter, with a few mixed type II  III kerogens. Pristane/phytane, pristane/nC17, and phytane/nC18  ratios were found to vary respectively from 0.621.52, 1.001.17 and 0.681.25 for Parabe35 shales and 1.211.77 1.752.20 and 0.610.99 for Mina3 shales. These values are consistent with the dominantly terrestial organic matter in the sediments. The range of vitrinite reflectance values (Parabe: 0.180.50%; Mina: 0.230.48%) indicate that the shales are immature to marginally mature.Attempts at source rockoil correlation using gross hydrocarbon  ompositions, saturate/aromatic ratios and nalkane distribution patterns indicate that the shales are not the source of the crude oils, which probably migrated from beyond total depths in the two wells, through major growth faults. |Theses Collection|petrographic/isolated kerogens/chromatographic/Organic petrography.*||||||SOMOYE, Adesina Olusegun.|M|Biostratigraphy and paleoecology of the foraminifera of Erema-4 and Ubeta-3 wells of Niger Delta area of Nigeria. |||||| M.Sc.  |M.B.

The stratigraphic sequences penetrated by the two wells have been established while stratigraphic distribution of the Foraminifera of both wells which provides information about age, zonation and paleoenvironmental interpretations of these sediments has also been determined.A total of one hundred and nineteen, and one hundred and fifty-two ditch cutting samples from Erema-4 and Ubeta-3 wells respectively were processed for their foraminiferal contents using standard micropaleontological procedures. Ninety-eight species of Foraminifera were recovered and identified from Brema-4 well while fifty-eight species were from Ubeta-3 well.The stratigraphic sequences penetrated by Erema-4 and Ubeta-3 wells in the Niger Delta subsurface have been divided into three lithologic units: A, B and C which are correlative to the already established Benin and Agbada formations of authors. On the basis of the planktonic foraminiferal associations of the fossiliferous Units B and C, an Early to Middle Miocene age has been assigned to the sediments of both wells.  In addition, three planktonic Foraminifera zones have been established for both wells.  These are the Globigerinoides quadrilobatus primordius - Globorotalia kugleri zone; Globigerinoides trilobus - Globigerinatella insueta zone; and the Orbulina suturalis - Globorotalia peripheroronda zone.Also three informal benthonic Foraminifera zones have been established each for Erema-4 and Ubeta-3 wells.  These benthonic zones are facies equivalents in the two wells.  The benthonic Foraminifera zones of Erema-4 well are Eponides eshira - Lenticulina rotulata zone; Textularia panamensis - Uvigerina sparsicostata zone; and Florilus incisus - Heterolepa pseudoungeriana zone while those of Ubeta-3 well are Textularia panamensis - Planulina foveolata zone within which occurs the Uvigerina - Bulimina acme zone; Hanzawaia surattoni - Heterolepa pseudoungeriana zone; and the Hanzawaia strattoni - Ammonia beccarii zone.A paleodepth of deposition of about 0 - 700 metres has been inferred for the studies area on the basis of the recovered Foraminifera.  A warm tropical paleotemperature of between 12.3oC - 30oC has also been deduced.  The paleosalinity of the sea in which these sediments were deposited has been inferred to be between 20% and 40%.|Theses Collection|lithostratigraphic, biostratigraphic, and palecologic/stratigraphic/Foraminifera/lithologic/planktonic/Globigerinoides quadrilobatus primordius - Globorotalia kugleri zone; Globigerinoides trilobus - Globigerinatella insueta zone; and the Orbulina suturalis - Globorotalia peripheroronda zone/paleosalinity .*||||||ADENUBI, Adeyinka Adesola. |M|Distribution pattern of bacteria and fungi in the Dodo North mangrove forest soil of the Niger Delta. ||||||M.Sc. |O.

The aim of the present work was to assess the total microbial load of the soil, determine the populations of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in relation to the organic matter content and pH of the soil. The dominant bacterial and fungal species were identified by standard identification methods. A total of eight traverses, each 800m long and 200m apart were cut with a middle trace (baseline) running across the eight traces. Sampling with auger was done using systematic grid pattern, and at each observation point samples were taken at 0  15cm and 1530 depths.  The wet and dry season samples were collected in October and the following February respectively. Bacteria and fungi enumeration and isolation were done by dilution plate count method, using nutrient agar for bacteria and malt extract agar for fungi. Bacterial isolates were identified by morphological and biochemical characterization while fungal isolates were identified through cultural and morphological properties. The effects of season and soil depth on the bacteria and fungi distribution were assessed using Students' ttest at 5% level of significance, while correlation coefficient at 5% level of significance was used to know the effect of pH and organic matter content of the soil on the bacteria and fungi distribution. Chromic acid digestion method was used for the soil organic matter analysis while soil pH was determined using Glasselectrode pH meter Kent EIL 7020.Aerobic bacterial population at 0  15cm depth of the Dodo North mangrove forest soil ranged from 1.7 x 104 to 5.0 x 107/g of dry weight soil during the wet season and 1.0 X 105 to 2.6 x 107/g during the dry season.  The population of aerobic bacteria at 15  30cm depth ranged from 1.0 x 104 to 5.6 x 106/g and from 1.0 x 104 to 8.3 x 106/g during the wet and the dry seasons, respectively. Anaerobic bacterial population ranged between 2.0 x 105  and 2.9 x 107/g during wet season and between 1.0 x 105 and 1.2 x 107/g during the dry season.  At 15  30cm depth, the population of anaerobic bacteria ranged from 4.0 x 105  to 5.0 x 106/g during the wet season and from 0 to 9.8 x 106/g during the dry season. Fungal populations ranging from 0 to 2.0 x 106/g and 0 to 1.2 x 106/g were obtained at 0  15cm depth during the wet and dry seasons respectively.  At 15 - 30cm depth, the fungal numbers ranged between 0 and 5.6 x l05/g and 0 and 5.9 x 105/g during the wet and the dry seasons respectively. Bacteria and fungi distributions were not significantly affected by seasonal changes. Aerobic bacteria population was significantly higher within the 0  15cm depth than the 15  30cm depth.The pH of the highly acidic soil ranged from 3.4 to 4.0 and from 1.9 to 3.5 during the wet and the dry seasons, respectively at 0  15cm depth.  At the 15  30cm depth, the pH values ranged from 2.3 to 3.8 during the wet season and from 1.75 to 3.1 during the dry season. The organic matter content of the 0  15cm depth of the soil was between 18.19 and 33.10%, and from 21.01 to 35.20% during the wet and the dry seasons respectively.  At the 15 - 30cm depth, figures ranging from 16.00 to 35.00% and 18.00 to 34.85% were obtained during the wet and the dry seasons, respectively. Out of the thirty-eight bacterial species isolated in the soil, Bacillus sp. accounted for 42.11%, Enterobacter sp. 15.79% and Pseudomonas sp. 13.16%.  Others included Flavobacterium sp. (7.89%),  Cytophaga sp. (7.89%), Azotobacter sp  (7.89%) and Pelodicyton sp (5.26%).  The dominant fungal species isolated were Aspergilus sp. which accounted for 37.5% of the total fungal isolates. Other species were Trichoderma, Penicillium, Syncephalastrum Rhizopus, Mucor, Botryodiplodia, Curvularia, Fusarium, Botrytis and Neurospora with 6.25% occurrence each.

Surface water samples were taken on the surface (by a dip) while bottom water samples were taken using water sampler. The wet and dry season samples were collected in October, 1989 and February, 1990 respectively.  The enumeration and isolation of bacteria were done by dilution plate count technique.  Estimation of coliform bacteria population was done using the Most Probable Number technique while the assessment of physical and chemical properties were done using International Standard methods, Predominant bacterial isolates were identified using standard bacteriological methods.  Antibiotic sensitivity testing was done on Mueller Hinton agar using commercial antibiotic sensitivity discs.  The statistical analyses employed were the Students' ttest and Correlation Coefficient test as appropriate.The aerobic bacterial population for surface water during the wet and dry seasons ranged from 5.0 x 101 to 8.7 x 104 cfu/ml while in the bottom water the population varied from 5.00 x 101 to 4.08 x 104 cfu/ml during both seasons.  Anaerobic bacterial population during the wet and dry seasons for the surface water ranged between 1.00 x 102 and 6.95 x 104 cfu/ml while the range was between 1.000 x 102 and 2.405 x 104 cfu/ml for the bottom water.  Total coliform count for surface water during the wet and dry seasons was between 0 and >1840/ml while the count was between 0 and 1840/ml in the bottom water during both seasons. Faecal coliform counts for the wet and dry seasons varied from 0 to 2/ml in both surface and bottom water samples. Surface and bottom water temperature ranged between 26.5 and 31.7oC during the wet and dry seasons. The pH of the surface and bottom water during the wet and dry seasons varied between 5.9 and 7.1.  Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) values recorded for the surface and bottom water in the wet and dry seasons were between 0 and 5.3mg/l.  During the wet season, BOD5 value for the bottom water samples correlated positively (P < 0.05) with aerobic bacterial population. The organic matter content of the surface and bottom water ranged between 0 and 34.6mg/l during the wet and dry seasons.The bacteria isolated belonged to the genera Azomonas,  Flavobacterium, Azotobacter, Klebsiella, Aeromonas Pelodicyton, Aerococcus, Enterobacter, Staphylococcus, Proteus, Flexiibacter, Cytophaga, Micrococcus, Escherichia, Pseudomonas,  Achromobacter and Bacillus.  All the isolates were sensitive to tarivid (ofloxacin), and most of them exhibited different combinations of multiple resistance to other antibiotics. The observed high occurrence of multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) should be a cause for concern especially if it is associated with the resistance factor which is involved in the transfer of antibiotic resistance from strain to strain by cellular contact.|Theses Collection|predominant aerobic, anaerobic and coliform/thirtyone/coliform/Mueller Hinton agar/Anaerobic bacterial population/Faecal coliform/zomonas,  Flavobacterium, Azotobacter, Klebsiella, Aeromonas Pelodicyton, Aerococcus, Enterobacter, Staphylococcus, Proteus, Flexiibacter, Cytophaga, Micrococcus, Escherichia, Pseudomonas,  Achromobacter and Bacillus.  *||||||ADEWUMI, Titilayo Olufunke.|F|A study of the factors contributing to microbial contamination of clean surgical wounds at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife. ||||||M.Sc. |K.A.

The risk of infection developing in surgical wounds is dependent on a number of factors including patient, personnel and the environment. The study was undertaken to determine the importance of patients, personnel and airborne microbes in the operating room as sources of intraoperative contamination of clean wounds at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, IleIfe.A total of one hundred and one patients were monitored for postsurgical clean wound infection in this study. Swabs of the anterior nares of patients and attending surgical staff were cultured on blood and mannitol salt agar, while samples of incision site of patients were obtained with sterile cotton tipped applicators prior to skin closure and plated on blood agar.  Aerial  contamination of the operating suite was assessed by exposing settle plates containing various bacteriological media. Inanimate items in the operating room were routinely swabbed and plated on blood agar. Bacterial isolates were identified by bacteriological methods, while fungal isolates were identified based only on their cultural and morphological characteristics.  Phage typing of Staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered from patients and attending surgical staff was performed using the present international set of typing phages and the antibiotic sensitivity patterns of these strains were determined by the agar diffusion method.The incidence of clean wound infection in this study was 1.98% and a mortality rate of 2.97% was observed. The mean colony count per plate per hour (c.p.h) of microbes on settle plates ranged from 1. 1  49.4 and 0.9 - 74.6 colonies in the operating room and exit area of the operating suite respectively. No correlation was found between the total number of bacteria and the incidence of postoperative clean wound infection. The nasal carriage rates of Staphylococcus aureus isolates among patients and attending surgical staff were 12.8% and 17.9% respectively. The phage typing of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered from patients and attending surgical staff revealed that group III and non typeable strains were predominant. All the Staphylococcus aureus isolates were resistant to penicillin, while 55.6% were resistant to tetracycline. In addition, 17.2% and 13.8% were resistant to chloramphenicol and streptomycin respectively. Sixteen percent of the wound swabs taken prior to skin closure showed bacterial growth but none of these wounds developed infection.The study revealed that coagulase negative staphylococci were the  predominant organisms associated with clean wound colonization and that sources of intraoperative bacterial contamination of the wound were the patients microflora and the operating room air.|Theses Collection|morbidity/airborne microbes/intraoperative/Swabs of the anterior nares/incision/bacteriological/morphological/Staphylococcus aureus/coagulase negative staphylococci.*||||||BAKARE, Mufutau Kolawole. |M|Evaluation of microbial biota and potential crude oil degradation in two acid soils of the Niger Delta. ||||||M.Sc. |O.

In view of possible oil spillage in the area, this study was undertaken to determine the microbial popuIation in relation to the organic matter content and pH of the soil, and to determine the potential ability of the isolated bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi to degrade crude oil. Two sampling sites were selected (AkieweOweh and Uvwiamuge) . Each site was divided into four traverses of 2.50m long.  Soil samples were collected at 25m interval along the transect at 015 cm and 1530 cm depths.  Bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi were enumerated using the dilution and pour plate technique.  The soil pH was determined electrometrically while the method of Walkley and Black was used to estimate the organic matter content.  The effect of soil depth on distribution of the microorganisms was determined by students ttest while the effects of organic matter and pH on distribution was determined by correlation coefficient. The population of aerobic bacteria plus actinomycetes in the topsoil (015 cm) ranged from 7.0 x 104 to l.7 x 106  and 3.0 x 105 to 1.6 x 107/g in AkieweOweh and Uvwiamuge respectively. The population of bacteria plus actinomycetes in the subsoil (1530 cm) ranged from 2.0 x 104 to 8.1 x 105 and 6.8 x 105 to 6.8 x 106/g in AkieweOweh and Uvwiamuge respectively. The anaerobic bacterial counts of the topsoil and subsoil for AkieweOweh ranged from 1.0 x 104 to 6.5 x 105 and 2.5 x 104 to 4.3 x 105/g respectively while the counts for Uvwiamuge ranged from 4.2 x 105 to 3.2 x 106 and 3.0 x 105 to 3.4 x 106/g for the topsoil and subsoil respectively. The  population of fungi in AkieweOweh and Uvwiamuge ranged from 0 to 1.6 x 105 and 2.0 x 105 to 5.0 X 105/g respectively in the topsoils.The pH values of the topsoil and subsoil ranged from 4.0 to 5.3 and 3.8 to 4.8 respectively in Akiewe-Oweh while the pH ranged from 4.0 to 4.8 and 4.8 to 5.3 for topsoil and subsoil respectively in Uvwiamuge. The organic matter content ranged from 0.27 to 3.76% and 0.13 to 4.9% in the topsoil of AkieweOweh and Uvwiamuge respectively.Thirtytwo species of bacteria and actinomycetes grouped into seven genera were isolated from the areas studied. These genera included Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Enterobacter, Flavobacterium, Acinetobacter, and Nocardia. The eighteen bacterial isolates utilizing crude oil were identified as species of Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter and Nocardia. The prominent fungi isolated from the soil samples included species of Aspergillus, Penicillium Fusarium, Mucor, Rhizopus and Trichoderma.  Four fungal isolates that grew on crude oil medium were species of Aspergillus and Mucor.  This study revealed that bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi capable of utilizing hydrocarbons are present in the two acid soils from the Niger Delta area of Nigeria.|Theses Collection|microbial ecology/actinomycetes/Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Enterobacter, Flavobacterium, Acinetobacter, and Nocardia/Aspergillus, Penicillium Fusarium, Mucor, Rhizopus and Trichoderma. *||||||OGUNKEYE, Olusola Olusesan.|M|Verticial distribution of petroleum degrading bacteria in Asejire water reservoir, Oyo State, Nigeria. ||||||M.Sc. |S.O.

The possibility of employing micro-organisms for the degradation of petroleum and its derivatives in minimizing contamination due to oil leaks and spills has prompted a number of investigators to study the process in the laboratory.  The present study was undertaken to determine the presence of autochtonous petroleum degrading bacteria and their vertical distribution pattern.  The distribution was also studied in relation to season and some physicochemical properties of the water that could affect the distribution of petroleum degrading bacteria in the habitat.The water samples were collected from six different sites using Kemmerer water sampler.  The most probable number (MPN) method and oil agar medium were employed for the enumeration.  The physicochemical properties of the water reservoir were determined by international standard methods.  The true petroleum degrading bacteria observed on oil agar medium were identified to the generic level by standard bacteriological methods. The variations in bacterial population was determined by analysis of variance, while the relationship between petroleum degrading bacteria and nitrate distribution was determined by correlation coefficient.Autochtonous petroleum degrading bacteria was observed in all the water samples collected from all the sites chosen in the water reservoir. The vertical distribution of the petroleum degrading bacteria followed a descending order pattern from the surface to the bottom of the water. The mean MPN values ranged between 23/100cm3 to 1,100/100cm3, while the mean count ranged between 15cfu/cm3 to to 1.8 x 103 cfu/cm3.There were seasonal variations in the petroleum degrading bacteria populations.  Highest mean counts of petroleum degrading bacteria obtained during the dry and onset of the rainy season were 3.88 x 102 cfu/cm3 and 1.80 x 103 cfu/cm3 respectively, while 2.85 cfu/cm3 was the highest count) obtained during the rainy season.  Statistical differences were observed for bacterial counts at different depths.  The petroleum degrading bacteria population during the onset of rainy season were significantly different from those of dry and rainy seasons.  The quantity of the physicochemical properties observed affected the distribution of the petroleum degrading bacteria.  The mean dissolved oxygen and temperature values obtained ranged between 3.lmg/1 and 8.9mg/1 and 20.5oC and 33oC respectively.  While the mean value of nitrate was between 0.4mg/l and 5.7mg/l. The surface water samples which contained higher values of dissolved oxygen and temperature, attracted higher counts of petroleum degrading bacteria.  Positive correlation coefficient was observed between petroleum degrading bacteria and nitrate ions during the wet season.Eight genera of bacteria were identified as true petroleum degrading bacteria. The commonly encountered  genera include Serratia,  Bacillus, Enterobacter, Flavobacterium, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Alcaligenes and Aeromonas.  Asejire water reservoir contained enough autochtonous petroleum degrading bacteria throughout its depth to cope with a moderate spill, even though the quantity varies.|Theses Collection|autochtonous/physicochemical/Kemmerer water sampler/Autochtonous/Serratia,  Bacillus, Enterobacter, Flavobacterium, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Alcaligenes and Aeromonas.*||||||OKOH, Anthony Ifeanyin. |M|Effect of the extract of bitter leaf (vernonia amygdalina) on the production of beer from sorghum grains using saccaromyces carlsbergensis. ||||||M.Sc.  |G.O.

However, both barley and hops are imported from overseas, a venture that is very expensive and hence the encouragement for the promotion of the search for local substitutes.  Sorghum has been found to be a suitable alternative to barley but one of the major problems in its use is that of microbial contamination. Bitter leaf extract imparts bitterness, exhibits antimicrobial activity and is edible, hence it has been considered as a possible alternative to hops.  This research was therefore designed to confirm the antimicrobial ability of the bitter leaf extract and assess its possible application in reducing microbial load during the processing of sorghum for beer production and hence its effect on the growth and some properties of Saccharomyces carlsbergensis. The extract of the bitter leaf was obtained with methanol.  Isolation and enumeration of microbial load was done by spread plate technique, while the susceptibility testing was done by the cupplate agar diffusion method.  The brewer's yeast cell size, colony size and budding were determined by standard measurement techniques.  The effects of the extract in sporulation of the yeast, sugar uptake and alcohol production were investigated. The physical, chemical and biochemical analysis of the sorghum malt, wort and beer were determined by standard methods.  Statistical methods were employed in the analysis of the data. Four bacteria in the genera Bacillus, Clostridium, Aerococcus and Micrococcus isolated from the sorghum grains were susceptible to the bitter leaf extract. However, the bitter leaf extract was not effective against fungi at the concentrations tested.  The lethal time (LT50) of OXF6571 was shortened by 66min using 64.4mg/ml of the bitter leaf extract.  The net growth of brewer's yeast and the rate of increase in cell size was enhanced by the bitter leaf extract while budding was not affected. Sporulation was induced by the bitter leaf extract.Efficiency of utilization of sugar for biomass production was highest for sucrose and this increased with increase in the concentration of the bitter leaf extract. Glucose and maltose were however better utilized for alcohol production.  Steeping of sorghum grains in water, 500ppm formaldehyde and 30mg/ml bitter leaf extract for 18 hours reduced the bacteria load about to 60, 193 and 849 fold respectively.  The fungal population was virtually unaffected by water or the bitter leaf extract. Major specific and unique properties of the sorghum malt, wort end beer were not significantly affected by the bitter leaf extract. The implication of this wort is that the bitter leaf extract can be applied as an antibacterial agent in the processing of sorghum malt as well as a substitute for hop without exerting any appreciable deleterious effect on the quality of the beer produced.|Theses Collection|fermented grain malts/Sorghum/Saccharomyces carlsbergensis/Bacillus, Clostridium, Aerococcus and Micrococcus/deleterious.*||||||OYEDEJI, Solomon Kolawole. |M|An epidemiological survey of conjunctivitis caused by bacteria in neonates in Ile-Ife. ||||||M.Sc.  |G.O.

This study was designed to investigate the bacteria aetiologic agents of the disease in three outpatient clinics in IleIfe, examine the prevalence of the disease, find out the pattern of antibiotic susceptibility of the bacteria isolates and to assess a few anthropometric data such as age and sex of the neonates, socioeconomic status of parents as possible predisposing factors which may influence the rate of occurrence of the disease.Four hundred and two neonates between the age range of 116 days were sampled during the study period, out of which 300 had purulent eye discharge, while the remaining 102 were sampled as control subjects.  For the isolation of bacteria, purulent exudate from the eyes of the infected neonates was taken using sterile swab stick and streaked directly on preformed sterile agar media such as blood agar, mannitol salt agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar.  The inoculated media were transfered to the laboratory within 23 hours of sample collection for further studies.  Bacterial isolates were identified based on their cultural, morphological and biochemical characteristics, while their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined by the broth microdilution method as specified by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory, Approved Standard.A total of 268 cases (89%) were positive for bacterial isolation among the 300 clinical cases; while 20 (19.69%) of the 102 control subjects showed bacterial growth.  Statistical analysis revealed an association between isolation of bacteria and the occurence of clinical neonatal conjunctivitis (P < 0.01). Due to nonavailability of ThayerMartins medium, Neisseria gonnorrhoeae could not be isolated.  However, the 301 bacteria isolates obtained were made up of Staphylococcus aureus 130 (43.2%), Staphylococcus epidermidis  41 (13.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 36 (12.0%), Staphylococcus hominis 28 (9.3%), Klebsiella spp. 23 (7.6%) and Staphylococcus salprophyticus 14 (4.7%).  Escherichia coli 9 (3.0%), Pseudomonas fluorescens  7 (2.3%), Staphylocossus warneri 7 (2.3%) and Staphylococcus xylosus 6 (2.0%). All the strains of bacteria isolated were susceptible to tarivid (ofloxacin) (MIC range 0.92  14.71 ug/ml) and relatively resistant to gentamicin, ampiclox, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. The incidence of the disease was higher among the females 142 (53.0%) than the males 126 (47.0%) but this was not significant and more clinical cases were recorded within 14 days age group compared with the other age groups, although this was also not statistically significant.  One hundred and Eightythree (61%) of the 300 symptomatic neonates were from the illiterate parents, 36 (12%) from the educated elite parents, 30 (10%) from the low income group parents and 51 (17%) from parents of unknown designation.  This distribution pattern based on socioeconomic status of parents was statistically significant (P < 0.01). Thus, the socioeconomic status and environmental sanitation could be factors which can influence the prevalence of the disease.Arising from this study, Staphylococcus aureus was established as the predominant aetiologic agent of neonatal conjunctivitis in IleIfe and its environment.  However, the new drug tarivid (ofloxacin) would be the best choice, if it can be found applicable for use in infants.  It is recommended that prophylaxis by the use of potent antibiotics, improvement of environmental sanitation both in the community and the hospitals as well as the education of nursing mother be encouraged to reduce the occurrence of the disease.|Theses Collection|Neonatal conjunctivitis/chlamydia/aetiologic/anthropometric/purulent exudate/blood agar, mannitol salt agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar/Staphylococcus aureus 130 (43.2%), Staphylococcus epidermidis  41 (13.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 36 (12.0%), Staphylococcus hominis 28 (9.3%), Klebsiella spp. 23 (7.6%) and Staphylococcus salprophyticus 14 (4.7%).

Geomagnetic pulsations (also known as micropulsations) are among geomagnetic variations that is, variations in the main magnetic field of the earth which are of external origin.  Studies of these pulsations at equatorial region are few compared with high and midlatitude stations.  Hence, this study apart from providing the first set of analysed data of Pc5 geomagnetic pulsations south of the dip equator in Nigeria will provide an update knowledge of their morphological features.The data for this study were obtained using a groundbased EDA fluxqate magnetometer (model FM 100B) stationed off Road 20 in the senior staff quarters of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ilelfe.  In order to accurately determine the amplitudes, periods and duration of the Pc5 geomagnetic pulsations, records with best qualities were selected, enlarged and digitized using a photostat machine and a digitizer. In obtaining the amplitudes, the digitized data were then interpolated and converted into nanoTesla (nT) using a computer.Results show that both the amplitudes and occurrence characteristics show maximum around local noon 1200 hour local time (L.T.).  The amplitude of Pc5 geomagnetic pulsation at IleIfe is found to increase with the increase in kp index as reported for both high and midlatitude stations while the occurences maximizes at moderately high magnetic indices.  Pulsation activity of Pc5 showed maximum during the Equinexes and a minimum during June solstices (mayJuly).  The periods of Pc5 pulsations show semidiurnal variation and a negative but significant correlation with magnetic index kp.  Pc5 pulsations at IleIfe was linearly polarized in NorthSouth direction, that is, along magnetic meridian. These observational facts show that Pc5 magnetic pulsations at Ilelfe are of magnetospheric origin and propagation of these pulsations are in accordance with the theoretical field line resonance models which suggested that ultra low frequency (ULF) waves can be observed away from the resonance region (e.g. at the dip equator) as compressional evanescent (cutoff) modes. It is concluded that, in view of the limitations in this study, further basic study programmes are needed for both the regular (Pc) and irregular (Pi) geomagnetic pulsations in Nigeria.|Theses Collection|Morphological features/Geomagnetic pulsations/EDA fluxqate magnetometer/nanoTesla/Equinexes/magnetospheric.*||||||ADEYEMO, Adewumi Adefela.|M|The taxa composition, abundance and distribution patterns of zooplankton fauna of rivers and streams in Central Nigeria. ||||||M.Sc.  |I.F.

The work was undertaken to characterize the taxa composition of zooplankton of the water bodies, to assess their abundance and distribution pattern and to show the relationships between the recorded species as well as their community structure. Fiftythree sampling stations were established. Sampling was carried out trice: October, 1987 to represent late rainy season, April through May 1988 to represent late dry season and May 1989 at the peak of dry season.  Sample collection was limited only to surface waters.A total of fiftysix species of zooplankton consisting of six species of Cladocera, eleven species of Copepoda and thirtynine species of Rotifera were recorded. Rotifers being the most abundant of the zooplankton in rivers and streams in Central Nigeria were dominated by members of the family Branchionidae.  Zooplankton were more abundant in the dry season than rainy season and in river impoundment/riverine lake stations than in other classes of stations. Indicator species of pollution recorded include Branchionus urceolaris Muller, Filinia opoliensis (Zacharias) Kellicottia longispina (Kellicott), Keratella cochlearis Gosse and it's suggestive of moderate to low pollution.

Poensis bicolor Fraser, 1842 and Estrilda melpoda melpoda Vieillot, I817 were monitored for a threeyear period from April 1987 to March 1990 with the aim of determining the influence of environmental factors and body condition on reproductive activities.  Mistnetted birds were chloroformed, weighed, moult noted and dissected to ascertain the reproductive state of both sexes.  The flight muscles were dissectedout and the lean dry weights were determined. Nest records were kept so as to determine details of site, plant species used, construction and dimension of nests, size and colour of eggs among other avian parameters.  Collected data were subjected to statistical analyses using Students Ttests and regression analysis where appropriate.It was found that the reproductive seasons coincided closely with the rainyseason, when grass seed and insect abundance were highest.  Over the seasons, reproduction in both species of Lonchura was bimodal whereas it was unimodal in Estrilda melpoda melpoda. Replacement of flight feathers started early in May in Lonchura cucullata, late May in L. poensis bicolor and early June in Estrilda melpoda melpoda. The estimated mean duration of moult in the three species seemed to be protracted in Lonchura cucullate (179  9 days), L. poensis bicolor (134  9 days) and Estrilda melpoda melpoda (142  6 days). It became apparent that reproduction and moult were not separated in time and therefore they were compatible.The most important internal factor governing reproduction was protein reserve in the flight muscles of the birds. It was found that the lean dry weights of proteins in the females were more influenced by reproduction and reproduction took place only when the female had large quantity of protein reserve to form eggs.  Both protein reserve (0.33g in Lonchura cucullata, 0.35g in L. poensis bicolor, 0.28g in Estrilda melpoda melpoda), and body weight (8.7g in Lonchura cucullata, 9.lg in L. poensis bicolor, 8.4g in Estrilda melpoda melpoda) of the three species were at their lowest towards the end of the reproductive season.  Testis activity was at its lowest in January and December and highest from April to August.  Lonchura cucullata showed early testes activity and had fully active testes in March.In the three species, domeshaped nests were constructed of grass inflorescences and both sexes exhibited cooperative behaviour during nest site selection and nest building activities. Eggs were laid on consecutive days until the cluth was completed.  The mean clutch sizes in Lonchura spp. and Estrilda melpoda melpoda were five and four eggs respectively.  The eggs were incubated for I1 to I5 days and the young were brooded for I3 to I5 days.  Predation on the nests was the greatest factor reducing reproductive success in these birds.|Theses Collection|estrildine birds, Lonchura cucullata Swainson, 1837,  L.

Unstarved specimens were used as controls. Samples from both starved and unstarved specimens were used to determine the effect of starvation on body weight, activity, promimate composition of the muscle, liver and brain of the fish. Similarly, the effects of starvation on the blood composition was determined by standard methods.The results revealed that starving the fish reduced its physical ability and body weight.  Judging from the values obtained for protein, lipid and glycogen, it became evident that the brain was less affected by starvation than the liver and muscle. During the first forty days of starvation, the bulk of the metabolic energy in the fish was provided by the lipid and glycogen of the muscle and liver.  However, with the prolongation of starvation (i.e. after 40 days) there was a reduction in the lipid and glycogen utilisation with a marked depletion in muscle protein.  Starvation also caused adverse haematological response in the fish. Factors found to affect these changes include length of starvation and the size of the fish.|Theses Collection|Oreochromis niloticus/lipid and glycogen/haematological.*||||||OMOJOLA, Ayobami Emmanuel.  |M|The effect of different preservation methods on the keeping quality of the fishes Sarotherodon galilaeus and Clarias lazera preserved by five different methods.||||||M.Sc.|E.A.

The result obtained was expected to give the fish processors an insight into how best to preserve their fishes.  It will also show the best conditions for keeping lean fishes and fatty fishes for consumption.The fish specimens were divided into two groups. One group had their guts and gills removed before processing while the other group was left intact. The two groups of fish specimens were then subjected to different preservative methods namely ovendrying, smokedry, sundrying (with and without salt) and freezing at 14oC.  The keeping qualities were based on their iodine values, peroxide values and total volatile bases as indices of spoilage.  Chemical analyses were carried out fortnightly to determine the rate of chemical deterioration of processed specimens with time by standard methods. Microbiological examinations were carried out using standard techniques while the bacterial isolates were identified using standard biochemical charaeterization methods.Iodine values decreased with storage times while the peroxide values and the total volatile bases increased in the products of all the preservation methods indicating deterioration in quality in all the methods.  However, frozen specimens had relatively higher quality than the products of other preservative methods throughout the keeping period. The sundrying method gave products with poorest keeping quality. Specimens preserved without their guts and gills gave better products than the corresponding specimens preserved with these organs intact. Species of Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium and Micrococcus were found predominantly on frozen specimens while species of Bacillus, Citrobacter, Neisseria and Clostridium predominate on dried specimens.|Theses Collection|Sarotherodon galilaeus/Clarid fish Clarias lazera/Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium and Micrococcus were found predominantly on frozen specimens while species of Bacillus, Citrobacter, Neisseria and Clostridium.*||||||OWA, Stephen Olugbenga.  |M|Taxonomy and distribution of Nigerian earthworms of the family eudrilidae and their possible use as indicators of soils properties.||||||Ph.D.|Ademola O.

Much information is required about their ecology. The present study was aimed, therefore, at identifying and describing eudrilid earthworms from many parts of Nigeria, mapping out their distribution and determining whether or not they can be used as indicators of soil properties.Earthworms and soil samples were collected from 104 sampling locations that covered a combination of most ecological,  geographic, vegetational and edaphic zones throughout Nigeria.  The earthworms were identified using standard anatomical procedures and characters. The airdried soil samples were analysed for particle size grades and chemical composition by standard techniques. Computer software S.P.S.S. (Statistical Package for Social Sciences), was employed to perform simple and multiple linear correlation and regression analyses between earthworm abundance and the habitat factors of the earthworms.  Cluster analysis was performed to determine natural grouping among the sampling locations.Thirtyfour earthworm species were identified. Two additional new species were described namely, Keffia penetrabilis and Keffia  proxipora. The merger of Agrotoreutus Segun and Eutoreutus Michaelsen  with Buettneriodrilus Michaelsen and the distribution of Iridodrilus Beddard over Heliodrilus Beddard and the newly published genus Segunia Sims was not upheld.A few earthworms can be used as indicators of some soil types. The indicator species for the ferruginous tropical soils on crystalline acid rocks is Hyperiodrilus oshogboenisis, that for RedYellow ferralsols is Libyodrilus mekoensis while Keffia penetrabilis is for alluvial Boils. Considering soil textural types, Hyperiodrilus eurvaulus and Hyperiodrilus millsoni are suitable indicators of sandy loam soils while Hippopera ajokei, Hippopera ifensis, Hyperiodrilus oshogboensis and Keffia nigeriensis are indicators of sandy loam or loamy sand, i.e. of light loamy soils.  For the heavier sandy clay loam or clay, Keffia proxipora is the indicator. It is suggested that the distribution of earthworms could guide the demarcation of boundaries in the mapping of biotic, rather than purely vegetational zones.| Theses collection.|taxomomic/ecology/eudrilid earthworms/edaphic zones/anatomical procedures/airdried soil/Keffia penetrabilis and Keffia  proxipora//Agrotoreutus/Eutoreutus/Buettneriodrilus/Iridodrilus/Heliodrilus/Segunia/Hyperiodrilus oshogboenisis/Libyodrilus mekoensis/biotic.*||||||FAFORIJI, Richard Adebayo.|M|Federal financial transfers and State Government fiscal behaviour in Nigeria: 1978 - 1984. ||||||Ph.D.|S.A.

It also examined the extent to which the revenue sharing arrangement as operated within this period, provided adequate income to the State Governments, given their expenditure requirements. Furthermore, the study, which covered all the nineteen states in existence during the period, examined the extent to which State Governments utilized available  opportunities to exploit their internal sources of revenue.With the aid of secondary crosssectional data from relevant sources, a multiple regression analysis was adopted, the results of which were used to test the hypotheses of the study. The study postulated that Statutory Allocation had negative effect on the internal revenue efforts of State Governments during the period of study, but that Loans stir, iiulated their efforts.  It also postulated that given available tax handles, the states generated lower internal revenues than their capacity.The result of our analysis showed that during the period of study, many State Governrnents generated internal revenues much below their capacity, and that they were grossly underfunded under the revenue sharing arrangement. The result showed further that Statutory Allocation and Loans had no significant effect on the internal revenue efforts of the State Governments. Also, as a revenue equalisatiori scheme, the Statutory Allocation had no significant effect on the relative economic status of the states during the period. Thus, the study argued that, a centralized expenditure system, whereby state programmes are funded from the Federation Account on matching and conditional basis should be implemented in order to stimulate their internal revenue efforts, and that State Governments should be granted the power to vary the rates and coverage of their taxes. The study also argued further that the share of the Federal Government in the Federation Account should be reduced in favour of State Governments.|Theses Collection|Statutory Allocation/expenditure requirements/hypotheses/internal revenue/Loans stir/centralized expenditure system/Federation Account/revenue sharing/crosssectional data *||||||OGUNLEYE, Edward Oladipo.|M|Corporate growth determinants in some selected Nigerian manufacturing industries: 1974 - 1985||||||Ph.D.|J.A.

Secondarily, it identified the major restraints to corporate growth in Nigeria, determined the average growth rate and the disparity in the growth rate of firms of different size classes, examined the extent to which economic and financial factors vis a vis sociopolitical factors affect corporate growth in Nigeria and investigated the extent to which the existing corporate growth theories are relevant in a typical less developed country  Nigeria.The methods of analyses were based on both parameter estimations and questionnaire survey approaches.  Using net assets and turnover as measures of size, the effects of such factors as size, profitability  and some other financial ratios on growth were examined. In examining the effect of size, some statistical and econometric methods which include mean growth rate and variance analysis, regression analysis and bivariate size distribution and variance analysis were made use of. In examining the effects of profitability and other financial ratios, only regression analysis was made use of. The questionnaire survey was with a view to identifying those factors which are not easily reflected in the Annual Reports and statements of Accounts of companies which formed thne basis for the data for parameters estimations.The study revealed that the importance of financial strength by both net assets and turnover in explaining higher profit rates and hence higher growth rates have only become relevant and well pronounced with the setting in of the worldwide recession of the early 1980's, and the consequential structural adjustment programme which was introduced.  As a corollary to this, the established relationship between corporate growth and profitability; that profitability is an important argument of the growth function, was confirmed. The important growth inducing and growth retarding factors identified in the questionnaire survey are nonfinancial and mostly exogenous to their operations. The growth inducing factors include competitive action to expand market in existing markets and overall expansion of existing markets, both of which are pursued through more intensive advertising.  Product  diversification, especially into agriculture was also identified as a growth inducing factor especially since the recessionary period when, as a result of increasing scarcity of foreign exchange, many companies have had to be sourcing their raw materials locally.  On the other hand, the growth retarding factors identified include unstable government policies, shortage of raw materials, foreign competition and general economic conditions.|Theses Collection|manufacturing industries/growth/sociopolitical factors/econometric methods/regression analysis/structural adjustment programme/exogenous/growth retarding factors/*||||||UNIAMIKOGBO, Samuel Ogbomeda|M|An economic analysis of the domestic resource cost and effective protection in selected Nigerian manufacturing industries: 1970-1984||||||Ph.D|J.A.

To achieve the above stated goals, two basic approaches were adopted in the area of methodology. The first dealt mainly with the evaluation of domestic resource cost and the various measures of,tariff protection in the Nigerian manufacturing industries for selected years.  The second approach formulated models to examine the relationship between tariff structure and industrial  development, and the extent to which the variations in industrial development have been affected by changes in the tariff structure (net effective rate of protection), employing the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression technique.  The data used were obtained from the publications of the Federal Government of Nigeria, the Central Bank of Nigeria, the International Monetary Fund and the Federal Office of Statistics. The study revealed that activities in the capital goods sector with the lowest protective measures had the lowest domestic resource cost in terms of foreign exchange saving or earning while those activities in the consumer goods sector with the highest protective measures recorded the highest domestic Cost of foreign exchange.  Though the study also showed that the protection afforded, the capital goods sector was higher than that of intermediate goods sector in some of the yearst the bias of the tariff structure was clearly in favour of the consumer goods sector and against the intermediate and capital goods sectors.  In addition the discriminations against exports as expressed by negative net effective protection were more pronounced in the intermediate and capital goods sectors. These have retarded the pace of industrial development. The statistical methods employed in this study revealed that, there were statistically significant relationships between the measures of tariff protection and Import Substitution and Average Growth Rate of Domestic Production in some versions of the models. Furthermore, the unique number of years for adequate effectiveness of the measure of tariff could not be determined.For meaningful industrial development to be achieved, both the tariff rates on material inputs of some of the industries and the excise duties on some of the locally produced goods should either be reduced to the barest minimum or abolished. To avoid the discrimination against export industries usually arising from an over-valued domestic currency, there is the need for an appropriate exchange rate for the domestic currency.|Theses Collection|foreign exchange/tariff structure/Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)/International Monetary Fund/Federal Office of Statistics/capital goods sector/ intermediate goods sector/tariff/Import Substitution and Average Growth Rate/excise duties/over-valued domestic currency/exchange rate.*||||||AKPAN, Philip Abraham.|M|Analysis of patterns of development in South-Eastern Nigeria. ||||||Ph.D. |J.O.

It also sought to classify the LGAs into development planning regions. Data on 26 variables including agriculture, manufacturing, social services, transport and communications were collected and analyzed. Statistical techniques used included factor analysis to identify patterns of  development multiple regression to determine causes of variation, and cluster analysis to group the LGAs.The results obtained from the analyses revealed a number of findings.  Six factors accounting for 73% of variation in the original 26 primary variables described the patterns of inequalities among the LGAs. These factors were postal communications, secondary school education, cooperatives, populationsize, cash crop and community development.  An analysis of the distribution of factor scores also confirmed the existence of inequalities among the 71 LGAs.  On the whole, some Local Government Areas loaded positively on factors of urbarnization, while others were positively associated with factors depicting socioeconomic setting. Thus, the existence of dualism in the space economy of the study area was revealed. In the analysis of the causes of variation in development, it was found that three independent variables explained about 70% of total variance. These variables were population of Local Government headquarters, population of Local Government Area and accessibility index of Local Government Area headquarters. Accessibility was, however, the most consistent explanatory variable in terms of its direction of influence on most of the factor.  A classification of the original 71 LGAs yielded ten disint planning regions. Four of these regions comprising 6 LGAs were described as developed, while the other 6 regions comprising 65 LGAs were found to be lagging. A number of recommendations were made to reduce the spatial inequalities identified.  Since the distribution of population and resources had been at the base of the inequalities, an important way out of the problem was to redistribute population and resources in the area.  To this ends, designation of more urban centres, improved accessibility, large scale farms, productionoriented cooperatives, and relevant communitybased programmes were recommended.|Theses Collection|cluster analysis/populationsize, cash crop and community development/urbarnization/dualism/space economy/large scale farms/communitybased programmes.*||||||ONI, Isaac Oluwatope|M|Military professionalism and military political rule in Nigeria since independence. ||||||Ph.D. |T.O.

To pursue this objective, the impacts of military political involvement were examinied on six subthemes of professionalism, viz: cohesiveness, institutional autonomy, nationalism and patriotism, expertise, puritanism, and discipline. We also aimed at determining the present state of combat  readiness of the Nigerian military in the light of its political involvement, and the prospects of a stable civilmilitary relation in Nigeria.Our primary data derived from concrete historical events and activities of successive military administrations in Nigeria, with the intent of examining their implications for each subtheme of military professionalism. We also employed the interview method in the collection of data.  Two categories of respondents were interviewed viz: retired and serving military officers; and university lecturers and journalists. Other sources of data included  newspapers, magazines, books of historical accounts on the Nigerian military and its political role, and informal interactions with officers and men of the armed forces. The qualitative method was employed in interpreting our data.  The discussion of each subtheme was started by analysing relevant historical events and policies of successive military governments in Nigeria that relate to the particular dimension of professionalism under consideration. These were then set against the views of our interview respondents, and against findings from other sources of data. In our analysis, we undertook a logical interpretation of these data, supporting it with tabular presentations where appropriate.Our findings revealed that all the six aspects of military professionalism which we examined have, in varying degrees, been dysfunctionally affected by the involvement of the Nigerian military in politics, the most adversely affected being cohesiveness, puritanism and discipline. We found that as a result of the loss of the traditional military puritanist ethics, class reference group has become a more potent force in determining social action, which tends to reduce and dilute the force of professional reference group and values in the process of social action.  We discovered that the Nigerian military has sought to extend its political domination of the state to enforce a sociopsychological submissiveness of the civil society. The civilians' attempt to resist this has produced incessant civil  military clashes.Military political involvement was found to have highly dented the corporate image of the Nigerian armed forces. Indeed, the views of members of the civil society concerning the military apparatus appear negative, cynical and even contemptuous. There was also an easy consensus among our various sources of data that a prior step towards revamping the quality of professionalism in the Nigerian military must involve its lasting withdrawal from politics to face its primary calling of national defence.  Finally, we found that the prospect of a stable civil  military relation in Nigeria appears bleak and elusive unless the military accepts the principle of the supremacy,of civilian authority, and unless the social, structural and economic conditions that produce and nurture political instability are positively transformed. |Theses Collection|military in politics/Nigerian armed forces/institutional autonomy/nationalism/patriotism/puritanism/military professionalism/*||||||AINA, Olabisi Idowu.|F|Gender differences in work attitudes and behaviour among selected industrial workers in Lagos.||||||Ph.D.|Simi Afonja||Ile - Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Sociology and Anthropology |1992.||| OAU |||||xvi, 518p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

Using the Nigerian industrial experience, this study challenges some of the basic assumptions of the traditional theories of sexual dimorphism in work organisations.  The study therefore examines gender differences in industrial employment looking at organisational opportunity structure at both objective and subjective levels. It also examines men and women's work attitudes and behaviour looking at personal attributes and ideological values about gender role relations. The unique experiences of men and women in sex-atypical jobs are also documented.  To achieve the objectives of the study, both micro and macro level analyses are made, as explicated in the "genderorganizationsystem' (GOS) schema adopted for the study.  The GOS approach is entrenched in the Weberian tradition of the social action theory and the Durkheimian objective social reality. Emanating from the theoretical framework, three major assumptions are made, resulting in nine operational hypotheses.Data for the study were collected from five multinational companies with fairly large female labour force, in Lagos.  On the whole, 281 respondents were included in the sample survey while 36 others were studied with qualitative methods. Other methods of enquiry include direct observation and a review of some official records.The data collected were analysed with nonparametric and inferential statistics. The results of the data analyses and the findings support an interlocking system of relationship between and among gender, work, and cultural factors.  Although gender sometimes has a preeminent influence on work roles, generally men and women in the same occupational group share the same work interests, hours, and employment status than men and women across occupations, signifying the influence of both individual attributes and structural factors. In a few cases, cultural barriers interact with discriminatory intent to produce forms of discrimination that is sometimes invisible yet perpetuating. All the operational hypotheses are confirmed except one, indicating the validity of the theoretical assumptions of the study. However, on the basis of the findings, the study argued that it is necessary to create employment equity, and improve men and women,s access to full employment opportunity and better working conditions, as these are important sources of maintaining an efficient workforce. Finally, implications of the findings which could help introduce feminist theoretical and methodological tools into organisational studies are presented.|Theses Collection|gender issues/epistemological/Nigerian industrial experience/sexual dimorphism/sex-atypical jobs/genderorganizationsystem' (GOS)/Weberian tradition/nonparametric and inferential statistics/operational hypotheses*||||||DAIRO, Olawale Usman|M|A study of the drying characteristics of benniseed||||||M.Sc|O.O.

To carry out efficient drying operations, there is the need to determine important drying characteristics such as equilibrium moisture content, thinlayer drying behaviour and resistance to airflow. The objective of this study was therefore to determine equilibrium moisture content, thinlayer drying behaviour and airflow resistance of benniseed and the effect of various factors such as air temperature, air relative humidity, drying time, airflow rate, moisture content and bulk density on the drying characteristics.The desorption equilibrium relative humidity was studied at five  temperatures (40, 50, 60, 70 and 80oC) and moisture content values ranging from 4.9 to 25.5 per cent (dry basis) using the vapour pressure manometric method.  The thinlayer behaviour was studied in an oven at temperatures of 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80oC, initial moisture contents of 6.95 to 21.1 per cent (dry basis) and relative humidity values ranging from 12.5 to 58 per cent.  The resistance to airflow was studied at bed depths of 0.15, 0.30 and 0.45m, airflow rates of 0.234 to 0.369 m3/s.m2, bulk density ranging from 562.5 to 713.2 kg/m3 and moisture content values of 6.5, 10.4 and 15.4 per cent (wet basis).The equilibrium moisture content decreased with increased temperature at constant relative humidity.  The modified Henderson model gave the best fit out of the six commonly used models used to evaluate the data obtained. It had standard errors of 3.3 and 4.1 per cent when equilibrium relative humidity and equilibrium moisture content were taken as dependent variables respectively. The drying rate increased with increased air temperature, and initial moisture content, and decreased relative humidity of drying air.Airflow resistance described the experimental data better than the exponential model with lower residual mean square values at all levels of factors used.  Model parameters were related to the experimental variables.The resistance to airflow increased with increased airflow rate, bulk density, bed depth, per cent fine material and decreased moisture content. Airflow resistance was accurately described by Shedd's equation and an emperical equation comprising of the test variables with over 99 per cent of variance being accounted for by the variables|Theses Collection|agricultural crops/benniseed/manometric method/Henderson model/best fit/standard errors/Airflow resistance/Airflow resistance/residual mean square/moisture content/Shedd's equation/*||||||DINRIFO, Rotimi Rufus||Mathematical modelling of the force-deformation characteristics of cocoa pods.||||||M.Sc.|M.O.

Parallel plate, quasistatic, uniaxial compression tests were carried out on two varieties of cocoa, viz: Amelonado and F3 Amazon. The data resulting from the test were analysed to determine some of the pods mechanical properties such as compressive breaking load, stiffness modulus and toughness.  The stiffness modulus values were compared with those calculated using relations adapted from Hertz's theory of contact stresses.The compression tests revealed that a cocoa pod features an approximately linear forcedeformation (fd) curve, cracks abruptly at the maximum sustainable load and shows a high degree of elasticity (about 85%). The average values of the compressive breaking load were 0.55 and 0.72kN for Amelonado and F3 Amazon pods respectively. The corresponding values of stiffness modulus were 92.8 and 94.0kN/m. When compared with the predictions of the Hertz theory a significant difference was recorded, using a two sample ttest.  This was found to be due to the pod's composite nature, complex geometry and rough surface as modifications incorporating these factors improved the predictions of theory. A rheological model was also developed to represent the behaviour of a pod during loading to breakage as in a podbreaking machine. The model consists of a linear spring, a telescoping element (to represent the irrecoverable deformation of about 15% the pod usually sustains when loaded and unloaded below failure load) and a fracture element (to simulate the sudden failure of the pod at the maximum load).  This model will require the addition of a Coulomb damper, a dashpot and a nonlinear spring in order to accurately simulate the more general conditions of creep and stress relaxation.|Theses Collection|cocoa pods/forcedeformation/Parallel plate, quasistatic, uniaxial compression tests/Amelonado/Hertz theory/ Coulomb damper/rheological model*||||||ADETONA, Oyebanji Suli|M|A study of heavy oil recovery by alkaline flooding at elevated temperatures||||||M.Sc|V.A.

This process has a great potential for recovering acidic (heavy) oils.  Past studies of alkaline injection processes have been mostly at relatively low temperatures (< 50oC). The present study investigated the recovery of heavy oil by caustic flooding at elevated temperatures using both static and dynamic techniques.Static experiments were performed to investigate the phase behaviour and properties of the microemulsion systems formed when caustic solutions contact heavy oil at selected pH (1214) and temperature (2790oC) conditions. These initial experiments provided the necessary guidance for the dynamic flow tests in which caustic solutions at varying concentrations, temperatures and frow rates were propagated through 14.3o API oil bearing sand packs. Measurements of bed properties, oil recovery, and kinetic data were taken.Significant increases in the rate of oil production and overall oil recovery were achieved at higher pH levels (> 12.0) of the injected fluid. There was also an increase of up to 5% in the oil recovery at 50oC compared to 27oC. At 60oC and above, the cumulative oil recovery showed a decline.  In contrast, caustic injection rate appears to have minimal effect on oil production leading respectively to overall recoveries of 15.3, 13.7, and 14.2% at 70, 84, and 104ml/min. The kinetic data revealed a strong correlation of oil recovery with the rate constants for caustic reactivity in oil sand matrix.|Theses Collection|hydrocarbon formation/microemulsion/caustic reactivity/sand matrix*||||||EWEJE, Bolade Theresa. |F|A study of interfacial phenomena in alkaline silicate-bitumen systems. ||||||M.Sc.|V.A.

The present experimental study   has been performed to investigate the interfacial phenomena occurring when the injected silicate contact bitumen. An initial characterization of the bitumen sample used was carried out to determine its API gravity and viscosity  temperature correlation.  Following this, static and dynamic experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of concentration of sodium ortho, meta-, and higherratio silicates, brine salinity, aliphatic alcohol additives and system temperature on the reaction of silicate solutions with bitumen and the phase behavior of the resultant multiphase systems.The API gravity of the bitumen was found to be 14.3 degrees while the viscosity was 13,20OmPa.S at 60oC.  The phase behavior data revealed an enhancement of bitumen mobilization at higher system temperature in all the alkaline silicate  bitumen systems studied. Similar behavior was also obtained with increased system pH at 28oC but only in cases where the ortho-, and metasilicates were used as the emulsifying agents.In the saline systems, increased NaCl concentration promotes the stability of upper phase microemulsion with a further indication   of higher microemulsion phase volume and increased oil mobilization at brine salinity greater than 1% NaCl than at lower concentrations.  Optimum salinity conditions corresponding to an oil  mobilization of 1.0, microemulsion oil solubilization of 0.5 and reduced phase equilibration time were attained at 2.5 and NaCl respectively for sodium ortho, meta and higherratio silicate cases.In contrast to the non-alcoholic systems, addition of butanol, hexanol and octanol to orthosilicate  bitumen system had an incremental effect on the transient behaviour of the microemulsion phase volume.  An acceleration of phase equilibration was also achieved at higher alcohol chain length, leading  to an optimum alcohol addition of less than 40% octanol. Explanation of  these results was proposed using information derived from the reaction kinetic data.  Also, the relevance of the various fidings for impoved silicate flood design was discussed.|Theses Collection|Alkaline silicate/interfacial phenomena/sodium ortho, meta-, and higherratio silicates, brine salinity, aliphatic/metasilicates/microemulsion/salinity/butanol, hexanol and octanol to orthosilicate.*||||||EKUWEM, Emmanuel Effiong. |M|Design and construction of a microcomputer-based automatic meteorological station.||||||Ph.D.|L.O.

Aviation and marine navigation activities, agricultural, environmental protection, urban and regional planning activities, among the many socio-economic activities of man, are subject to the vagaries of weather. The need to measure meteorological variables using appropriate instruments which form a sufficiently dense network of stations cannot, therefore, be overemphasized. This thesis presents novel as well as modified lowcost optoelectronic instrumentation techniques for routine measurement of wind speed, wind direction, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, temperature, sunshine duration, rainfall amount and hydrostatic pressure.Using basically optoelectronic instrumentation, sunshine recorder, wind speed and wind direction transducer circuitries were designed.  Temperature was measured using a Philips electrical temperature sensor circuit. For atmospheric pressure and hydrobarometric measurement, a combination of a Light Dependent Resistor and a Light Emitting Diode with novel reflecting mirror assembly was employed. A Philips capacitive sensor and a frequency to voltage converter circuit was used for the measurement of relative humidity. For rainfall measurement the turbo-raingauge  principle in combination with optoelectronic circuits was used.  A specially designed stopper beam provided good accuracy.  The combined circuitry of all sensors were integrated and tested for online data acquisition using a data logger, a storage module, a peripheral interface module and an IBM PC  compatible logger support software package.  Each sensor was modularized and encased.  Calibration was then carried out using established standard instruments.From calibration results, good correlation coefficient of over 0.90 was obtained for most circuits. The programmed tipping resolution of the turbo raingauge was 0.25mm of rainfall amount.  For the sunshine recorder the threshold was 2.5V. In the measurement of hydrostatic pressure, 1cm of it was equivalent to 0.9807hp. An anemometer range of 020 Knots was obtained while the relative humidity range was 95% to 20%. Data acquired during the outdoor performance test of the automatic station were favourable when compared with those acquired by conventional instruments at the same site.  Local fabrication of meteorological sensors and solar floatcharged remote site power supplies have been recommended.|Theses Collection|troposphere/meteorological variables/optoelectronic instrumentation/transducer circuitries/hydrobarometric/Light Dependent Resistor/Light Emitting Diode/Calibration/hydrostatic.*||||||ODERINU, Adekunle Omotayo. |M|Development of a rural telecommunication network in Nigeria. ||||||M.Sc. |T.I.

This is because rural areas in general are characterised by geophysical and economic problems that make provision of telecommunication service in such areas unattractive both financially and technologically. Efforts have however been made by different countries, developed as well as developing to provide telecommunication service for their rural communities.  As Nigeria is encouraging agroindustrialization of her rural areas, the provision of telecommunication service in these areas needs to be given due consideration along with other infrastructures in order to achieve an integrated rural development. The main objective of the project is therefore to design a telecommunication system suitable for rural parts of Nigeria.A digital telecommunication network has been designed for Atakumosa L.G.A. in Oyo State. The network uses a microprocessorbased "central" station located at Osu, and five "Subscriber" stations also microprocessor based which are located at OkeIbode, Isaobi, Iloba, Ibodi and Akeredolu.  Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) is used by the central station to transmit information contained in thirty time slots; with each time slotdestined for a particular subscriber station. At the subscriber's level, Dynamic Time slot Assignment (DTA) is used to allocate time slots to subscribers requesting service.  Transmission is carried out at the CCITT primary multiplex rate of 2.048Mbps. The switching function of the central and "Subscriber" stations was simulated on a microcomputer. The results obtained shows that an increase in the number of subscribers on the switch or the traffic intensity per line (calling rate) without a corresponding increase in the number of time slots led to a performance deterioration of the switch, with more calls meeting congestion. These results are in reasonable agreement with expectations.  Some recommendations are made to accelerate the development of rural telecommunications in Nigeria.|Theses Collection|rural telecommunication/geophysical/agroindustrialization/microprocessorbased/Time Division Multiple.*||||||OLLEY, Joshua Ibikunle.  |M|Investigation of the effects of power system outages on network performance. ||||||M.Sc.|O.A.

However, due to continuous changes in electrical load demand, planned and unplanned outages of the system equipment, the operating condition of a power system changes continually.  The ability of the power system to continue to operate in a secure state irrespective of these changes determines, to a large extent, the security of the system. Since the occurrence of unplanned equipment outages is not predictable, the effects of such outages are simulated using digital computers.  If it is detected that the outage of some equipment will cause system insecurity, corrective actions are taken. In this work, a Fast Decoupled load flow algorithm which can be used to investigate the effects of outages of generators, transmission lines or transformers was developed.  Based on the algorithm, a Fortran programme was written and used to evaluate the security of the 121 bus, 200 transmission lines and transformers network of the National Electric Power Authority of Nigeria. It was detected that the outage of certain transmission lines and generators resulted in voltage and reactive power limit violations. The programme was able to correct the reactive power limit violations in most cases.  For example, a partial loss of generation at Kainji resulted in 10% reactive power violation and this was corrected by increasing the terminal voltage from 15.60kv to 15.64kv.  The Programme could not correct the reactive power  violations in some cases because the attempt at correcting them  resulted in voltage limit violation. This shows that if such line or generator is disconnected in practice, the operator will need to resort to load curtailment to maintain the security of the system. The programme developed was able to detect equipment limit violation and correct reactive power violations in most cases. The study has shown that to avoid incessant power outage in the national network, it is necessary to reinforce some of the 330kv lines by providing additional lines.|Theses Collection|Operating Engineer/Fast Decoupled load flow algorithm/Fortran programme/terminal voltage.*||||||AWOWADE, Olufunmilola Olaitan. |F|A comparative evaluation of thermo-physical properties of wheat and wheatless bread. ||||||M.Sc. |A.

These are particularly invaluable for novel foods such as bread from composite and nonwheat flours in order to ensure products of reproducible quality.  This study furnishes data on some thermophysical properties of heat, cassava and maize flours as well as their combinations.Wheat, cassava  and maize flours were evaluated for particlesize, bulk density, colour, and amylograph pasting viscosity.  Rheological studies, using Haake rotational viscometer (RV3), were conducted on the dough and batter samples prepared from wheat, wheat-cassava, wheatmaize, cassava mixes and maize batter. Specific volume and specific heat capacity of the doughs were determined. Heat penetration during bread baking of the doughs was also compared.The mean particle size of wheat, cassava and maize flours were 154, 228 and 330 um respectively; while corresponding values obtained for bulk density were 498, 327 and 495 kg/m3.  Munsell colour notations showed cassava flour to be the whitest, followed by wheat and maize flours respectively.  Amylograph pasting temperature was found to range between 57.9o and 67.2oC. An increase in the level of substitution of wheat flour with nonwheat flours, produced an increase in peak viscosity while changes in the stability, setback value and amylograph consistency depended on the type and level of nonwheat flour.Rheological data showed that unyeasted doughs from wheat flour and composite of 50% substitution had comparable instantaneous elastic compliance (Jo) value of 0.95, 1.05 and 0.90 x 106Pa1  respectively for wheat, wheatcassava and wheatmaize doughs. For yeasted doughs, similar values of instantaneous elastic compliance, 1.20 x 106 Pa1  and shear modulus, 9.64 x 106 Pa, were recorded for wheat, wheatcassava composite (60% substitution) and wheatmaize composite (40% substitution) doughs; showing that they will likely yield breads comparable to wheat bread.At 40oC, substitutions with cassava gave higher values of specific volume (0.9321.025 x 103 m3/kg) compared to substitutions with maize (0.8661.019 x 103 m3/kg) while that of wheat was 0.966 x 103 m3/kg.  Specific heat capacity of cassava dough was higher than that of wheat dough. Peak values were observed for wheat and cassava bread doughs at 93oC and 83oC respectively. Thermal conductivity varied between 1.80 and 2.36 x 104 kW/mK for wheat dough while values were between 1.68 and 104 1.85 x 104 kW/mK for cassava doughs over crumb temperature range of 30 to 100oC.|Theses Collection|Thermophysical/novel foods/amylograph pasting viscosity/Rheological studies/Haake rotational viscometer (RV3)/Munsell colour notations/yeasted doughs/Thermal conductivity.*||||||EJILEMELE, Chijioke Wamadi. |M|A comparative evaluation of cassava and maize flour for wheatless bread manufacture. ||||||M.Sc. |I.A.

To reduce wheat importation, research efforts are being focussed on alternative source(s) of flour and technology for the baking industry. This study is therefore aimed at evaluating cassava and maize flour or starch for wheatless bread manufacture and also to determine the acceptablility of the product.Flour or starch, prepared from either maize or cassava, was evaluated for the following quality parameters: proximate composition, particle size distribution, water holding capacity (WHC), damaged starch content, diastatic activity, amylograph pasting viscosity and microbial quality.  Wheatless bread, manufactured from the flour or starch samples and their combinations, were subjected to taste panel evaluation.Proximate composition for flour or starch were 0,8-8%, 0.2-0.7%, 0.7-3.8% and 75-89.1% respectively for protein, ash, fat and carbohydrate contents. Corresponding range for wheatless bread samples were 3.5-10.7%, 1.9-2%, 3.5-6.4% and 37.4-53.0% respectively.  Maize flour or starch sample had a water holding capacity of 0.8-1.2 ml/g, while the corresponding range for cassava flour or starch was 0.8-1.0 ml/g.  The starch samples, while gellation was found to increase the water holding capacity of both flour and starch samples.  Flour samples had higher damaged starch content (3 to 22.5%) and diastatic activity (0.30.8mg maltose/100g) than corresponding starch samples. Peak viscosity of cassava flour (1220 B.U.) was higher than that of cassava starchg maize flour or starch.  Cassava flour and starch had lower retrogradation values than maize samples.  Flour samples were found to have higher bake water absorption, fermentation and baking time than the starch samples.All the wheatless bread samples were acceptable and there was no significant difference between the samples in their total scores.  Microbial counts of the flour and starch samples showed a range of 3.3 x 104  2.1 x 105 cfu/g for bacteria and 1 x 103  3 x 103 cfu/g for fungi. However, for the wheatless bread the range was 3.1 x 103 - 2.3 x 104 cfu/g and 1 x 102 - 2 x 102 cfu/g for bacteria and fungi respectively. Some of the micro-organisms identified included Bacillus sp, Serratia sp, Staphylococcus sp,   Lactobacillus sp, Penicillium expansum, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus oryzae and Endomycopsis fibuligera.  The data showed that nonwheat flour or starch have potentials in the manufacture of wheatless bread.|Theses Collection|Bread/diastatic activity, amylograph pasting viscosity and microbial quality/retrogradation/fermentation/Bacillus sp, Serratia sp, Staphylococcus sp,   Lactobacillus sp, Penicillium expansum, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus oryzae and Endomycopsis fibuligera. *||||||OGUNDELE, Gabriel Femi. |M|An evaluation of some pathogenic micro-organisms in selected Nigerian processed foods. ||||||M.Sc. |S.H.

However, there are reports of sporadic outbreaks of foodborne infections and poisonings.  This work looked into the determination of the occurrence of micro-organisms of public health significance in some processed foods and investigated the source of contamination. Selected processed food samples, namely: chocolate drink, banana flavoured ice cream, chocolate flavoured ice cream, canned beans and canned fish were obtained from department stores, depots and retail outlets.  They were analysed for the presence of some micro-organisms of public health significance.  The enumeration of coliforms in the dairy samples was based on the most probable number technique; while the evaluation and characterisation of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhi and Clostridium botulinum was based on appropriate standard methods as obtainable in literature. The results obtained showed the occurrence of Salmonella species, Iisteria species and Coliform bacteria in the dairy samples.  The percentage occurrence of Escherichia coli in chocolate drink samples was 50% while in both chocolate flavoured ice cream and banana flavoured ice cream it was 47%. However, banana flavoured ice cream showed the highest percentage occurrence of Listeria monocytogenes (33%) and chocolate drink had the lowest   percentage of occurrence (23%); while 30% was recorded for chocolate flavoured ice cream.  The percentage occurrence of Salmonella typhi in chocolate drink, chocolate flavoured ice cream and banana flavoured ice cream were 7%, 10% and 7% respectively. Bacillus species were recovered from the canned food samples.  However, Clostridium botulinum, the causative agent of botulism, was not isolated.Recovery technique studies showed that Listeria monocytogenes proliferated at 7oC over a period of 10 days. The mean generation time of the organism in chocolate drink (10.32 h) was higher than in yoghurt (18.06 h).  It was observed that freezing stopped the proliferation of the organism. The occurrence of these pathogenic microorganisms in the dairy samples indicates that they do not meet internationally accepted safety standards.  The figures obtained are higher than the Food and Drug Administration standards.  Therefore, if such processed food products are consumed, they may cause diseases which might be fatal particularly in children.  There is the need, therefore, to improve on surveillance of Nigerian processed foods to ensure their microbiological safety.|Theses Collection| micro-organisms/public health/contamination/coliforms/Listeria monocytogenes/Salmonella typhi/Clostridium botulinum/Escherichia coli/Iisteria/monocytogenes/Bacillus/pathogenic microorganisms.*||||||OMOTOSO, Oladipo Emmanuel.|M|Effect of aluminium additions on the corrosion properties of tin-zinc base alloy electro-deposit on a steel substrate. ||||||M.Sc. |A.

Since aluminium or aluminium alloys cannot be satisfactorily deposited from aqueous electrolytes, recourse was taken to developing an organic electrolyte that will permit the codeposition of aluminium, tin and zinc.  This project is therefore aimed at developing and optimizing a technique for the  electrodeposition of aluminiumtinzinc alloys and evaluating the corrosion resistance of the alloys.The study comprised a series of experiments in which coatings containing: 75% tin, 25% zinc; 10%; 20%; 30%; 40%; 50%; 60%; 70%; and 80% aluminium, balance tin:zinc in a ratio 3:1, were electrodeposited onto a steel cathode via an ethylbenzenetoluenealuminium bromide electrolyte. A potential of 26v was applied across the electrolyte cell to maintain a current density of 12.0  O.lmA/cm2.  The cell was constantly stirred and the specific conductance was kept at 35 x 103/cm by the addition of hydrogen bromide.  A deposition time of 100 minutes was required to deposit 1 mil thickness of the alloys at room temperature.  The cathode deposits were analysed for tin, zinc and aluminium by atomic absroption spectrophotometry. The cathode deposits were subjected to the copper chloride modified acetic acid accelerated corrosion (CASS) test to evaluate their corrosion properties.The tin, zinc and aluminium contents of each of the cathode deposits acquired a constant value after a period of electrodeposition time, ranging from 1000 minutes in the 80% aluminium alloy to 2500 minutes in the 10% aluminium alloy.  Agitation of the electrolyte was found to increase the efficiency of transfering the alloying elements from the anode to the cathode. Comparative results of the accelerated corrosion test showed that 20% aluminium offered the best corrosion resistance.  This was followed by the cathode deposits containing 75% tin; 25% zinc; 30% aluminium; and 40% aluminium.  The corrosion resistance then decreased in the following order; 50%, 60%, 10%, 70%, and 80% aluminium alloy deposits.  Thus, only the cathode deposit containing 20% aluminium, balance tin:zinc showed a marked superiority over the 75% tin, 25% zinc alloy coating.|Theses Collection|Corrosion/resistance/industrial environment/tinzinc base alloy/electrodeposit/*||||||ONYANGO, Leonard Odhiambo.|M|Computer simulation of the effect of operating parameters on the efficiency of the iron-making blast furnace. ||||||M.Sc. |G.O.

The ironmaking blast furnace remains the most efficient reactor for production of iron.  Efforts are continually made to make the process more efficient and less expensive in the face of mounting costs of raw materials. The blast furnace is like a black box. The  true state of the chemical and physical changes that occur in the furnace during iron making is little known.  Many studies and investigations have established that the overall process is amenable to external control of the input variables. However, documentation of the explicit relative effect of the control parameters is usually not readily available from steel plants to external investigators. In this work, a computer program simulating infurnace reactions has been developed. The simulation system is designed to model the effect of some process control parameters on the efficiency of an operating furnace. Several control parameters were tested.  These include blast air temperature, oxygen enrichment, coke ash content, and hydrocarbon fuel tuyere injectants. Statistical analysis was used to evaluate the working of the system. The system experiment output data were analysed and predictive mathematical models were established.The results revealed that, when changed singly and increasingly, oxygen enrichment produces the best positive response of the efficiency parameters of an operating blast furnace. Hot metal silicon content and blast moisture are very complementary to oxygen enrichment and blast temperature. The results obtained from this system show that it can be used as a process control tool by operators of the iron blast furnace.|Theses Collection|blast furnace/operating furnace/hydrocarbon fuel tuyere injectants/oxygen enrichment/predictive mathematical models*||||||IREFIN, Isaac Adeyemi.|M|Impact assessment of standardisation policies on selected food industries and consumers in Nigeria||||||M.Sc.|M.O.

The powers for the enforcement are invested in the Food and Drugs Agency, Standard Organisation of Nigeria, Weight and Measures Administration and Pre-shipment Inspection Agency.  Despite these standardisation laws and regulations, substandard food products are still found in the Nigerian markets. This study was therefore designed to critically study food standardisation policies, the roles of the enforcement agents in the implementation of these policies, the food manufacturing industries and consumer awareness of these policies.Data were collected from the Standard organisations, selected industries and consumers in Ibadan and Lagos using structured and unstructured questionnaires and personal interviews, and thereafter analysed with descriptive and qualitative statistics. The law enforcement organisations have not been effective due to such operational constraints as lack of adequate trained manpower, infrastrutural facilities and overlapping functions of the organisations. Some of the selected food industries do not always conform to standards because they lack standard quality control laboratories.Majority of consumers (61%) prefer to return substandard food products to the sellers; 6% will report such cases to the organisations, 1% preferred to take court action indicating a low level of awareness of the food standardisation laws among the consumers. However, sex, income and education contributed significantly to the awareness of the food standardisation laws or actions taken against substandard products. Among the male consitmers. income and age contributed significantly to awareness while location and education contributed significantly to action taken against substandard products.  However, age, income and education contributed significantly to awareness and action against substandard products among the female population. The results emphasize the need to merge the various enforcement organisations to form one autonomous body and adequately financed in order that their functions can be streamlined for effectiveness and efficiency.|Theses Collection|food standardisation laws/adulterated and misbranded products/Pre-shipment Inspection Agency*||||||MAKINWA, Edward Olatonade|M|Engineering economic assessments of the use of sorghum for brewing beer||||||M.Sc| M.O.

However, the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) introduced in the country in 1986 led to the use of sorghum and other locally available cereals for beer brewing.  This study investigated engineering problems such as plant replacement and adaptation encountered in some brew houses as a result of the use of sorghum for brewing. Interview and participation techniques were used for data collection.  This study also included investigative techniques on costs and policy implications.The technical problems were identified in milling, mashing and laundering processes.  However, the milling problem was solved by adapting the existing barley malt cleaner for sorghum grain at no cost. The use of external enzymes and installation of mash filter eliminated the mashing and laundering problems. However, the adoption of a special mashing technique which involves the use of endogenous enzymes of sorghum malt and either a manual or automatic siphon technique could solve these problems at reduced cost.  A brewery wishing to adopt this process should have a malting plant to guarantee the quality and steady supply of malt.  Such a malting plant of 6,000 tonnes annual capacity could generate an additional Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 30% which is greater than the existing bank interest rate. The policy which emphasises the use of local raw materials is very effective in the brewing industry in Nigeria. However, government should pursue the policy on the production of steel products which are essential for the fabrication of malting plants and other food processing facilities to enhance the building of indigenous technological capability in the industry.|Theses Collection|malted barley/Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP)/milling/mashing/laundering processes/endogenous enzymes/ Internal Rate of Return (IRR)*||||||OHABA, Jacob Ata. |M|A study of the commercialisation of selected soy-maize products. |||||| M.Sc. |F.E.

However, it is research efficiency or the extent to which research expands knowledge and becomes into wealth that is more important than research per se. This is because a research system in which no knowledge gets converted into product can only exist for a short time. This study is, therefore, an attempt to systematically document the commercialisation experiences of two weaning foods, Soy-Ogi and Nutrend Infant Cereal, which are successful innovative products in Nigeria, so that the experiences may be used in commercialising other products.Data were mainly from secondary sources. These sources included the information bulletin of the organisations which produced the foods, conference proceedings and newsprint media.  Questionnaire survey and interviews were used to supplement the secondary data source. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches to data were used. Sketches, percentages and some other quantitative analyses, where applicable, were used to illustrate and characterize evidence. The study showed that the  commercialisation of the two weaning foods began with research. The research into SoyOgi by the Federal Institute of Industrial Research, Oshodi (FIIRO) sought to improve protein intake of Nigerian children weaned unto the traditional Ogi while that associated with Nutrend was mainly to surmount raw materials crisis for baby food production by Food Specialties Nigeria PLC (FSN). Both weaning foods contained soyabean. The study also revealed that it is not the high protein content of about 40% (w/w) which soyabean has, like other oil seeds, that especially commended it for baby food formulation, rather, it is the excellent nutritive quality and the supplementary value of its protein. The results also showed that the commercialisation of Soy-Ogi and Nutrend involved a co-ordinated sequence of factors and activities.  Eight phases were distinguished, namely, the existence within the organisation of motivated and knowledgeable individuals who developed interests in the tasks/problems to be solved; identification of the problem to be addressed through research; recognition of new ideas as a possible solution to the problem identified; actual efforts to solve the problem; experimental development of the ideas; the design and fabrication of production facilities; test marketing of products; and introduction of product into the market.  More importantly, the study showed that the interests of the motivated and knowledgeable individuals were sustained in all the stages of the commercialisation process to keep the activities on course.About one-third, 32% of the 601 respondents surveyed, weaned their babies unto Soy-Ogi as against about 24% who weaned children unto Nutrend Infant Cereal, while all other weaning foods were responsible for the balance of 44%.  The 32% who weaned children unto Soy-Ogi was made up of 2.8% who used FIIRO's Soy-Ogi and 29.2 who made their own Soy-Ogi at home.|Theses Collection|Soy-Ogi/Nutrend Infant Cereal/Federal Institute of Industrial Research/Ogi.*||||||OKEJIRI, Ephraim Chukwuma. |M|An examination of limiting factors to coal production in Nigeria. ||||||M.Sc.|J.B.

In this study, the limiting factors to coal production were investigated. The purpose was to identify the causes of low production, as well as the ways to improve the production scenario. Data were collected  from both primary and secondary sources. These sources included the annual reports of the Nigerian Coal Corporation (NCC) and other relevant documents on the Nigerian coal industry.  Also, data were obtained from direct observation at the collieries, survey of miners using questionnaires, and interviews in the NCC and some industries using coal.It was discovered that there were no clear and specific productiondemand targets set for coal in Nigeria. The study also revealed that lack of technological capability and low investment rate in the industry have hindered the mechanization of mining operations. These findings show that coal is unlikely to play a major role in the Nigerian energy economy in the nearest future unless serious efforts are made to address them.  Nonethelsess, it is essential to encourage private sector investments in the Nigerian coal industry in order to improve the existing mining facilities and attract capital for new ventures.  Furthermore, there is the need to substitute smokeless coal briquettes for fuelwood as a way of relieving the pressure on fuelwood and increasing the utilisation of coal in the household.|Theses Collection|coal/Nigerian Coal Corporation/miners/briquettes.*||||||OMOTOWA, Amos Williams. |M|An evaluation of the training and employment prospects of science laboratory technicians.||||||M.Sc. |S.

In recognition of this important fact, this study evaluated the training and employment prospects of science laboratory personnel in Nigeria.  The study aimed at assessing the National Policy on Science and Technology as it affects the training of science laboratory personnel.  It also sought to identify possible gaps in the demand and supply of these personnel and determine their training needs.  This was with a view to recommending ways of bridging the gaps between training and labour market requirement.Data for the study were collected from a sample of employers, trainers and trainee-technologists from industries, universities and accredited polytechnics across the country through structured questionnaires and personal interviews.  Content analysis of documents obtained from National Board for Technical Education and the Nigerian Institute of Science Technology was also employed to complement the primary data.  Techniques for data analysis included rating indices.At the close of the study, it was discovered that the degree of practical acquisition by the technicians and technologists was 27.7% lower than acquired theoretical technical knowledge, contrary to the expectation of S & T policy.  Equipment and materials for skill training were lacking to the extent that they were unsatisfactorily rated as 45% and 38% by trainers and trainees respectively. On the industrial working experience of graduated technicians, 17.69% of them were found not to have undergone the mandatory minimum one year working experience before being enrolled on the HND programme.  This finding points to the trivialisation of the stipulated admission requirement.  It also underscores the lack of importance attached to industrial working experience, so crucial to technical competence.With respect to the supply of science laboratory personnel, it was discovered that training institutions were producing science laboratory technologists and technicians in the ratio 1:1.35, which represents a rather high bias towards the training of technologists compared to technicians. On the demand side, the employment prospects were found unimpressive. As much as 36.5% of all employing industries did not employ a single science laboratory personnel throughout a two-year period and 53.8% of them also did not have any unfilled employment vacancy for the personnel.The identified training needs advanced by industries, bore relevance to the nature of the various industries, thus e-emphasising the necessity of making training relevant to labour market requirement. On the basis of the major findings, recommendations were made on the need to establish an Industrial Liaison Centre in each training institution as well as an Employment Agency in the Federal Ministry of Employment, Labour and Productivity for technicians.|Theses Collection|National Policy/trainee-technologists/National Board for Technical Education/Nigerian Institute of Science Technology/e-emphasising.*||||||Boboye, Bolatito Esther|F|Mutations of regulatory genes affecting the synthesis of pectate lyase in xanthomonas caropestris campestria||||||M.Sc.

The pathogenicity of this organism is due mainly to the secretion of pectate lyase involved in the pectinolysis of plant cell walls.The objectives of this work were to study the production of pectate lyase associated with phytopathogenicity of Xanthomonas campestris campestris, to isolate and characterize the mutants in the regulatory systems controlling the production of pectate lyase and to examine the role of regulatory mutations in the synthesis of pectate lyase in Xanthomonas campestris campestris.Xanthomonas campestris campestris was grown and examined for pectate lyase activity in the presence of glucose and glycerol as energy sources and polygalacturonic acid and pectin as inducers. X. campestris campestris was subjected to ethylmethane sulfonate mutagenesis. Mutants were isolated and tested for the ability to produce pectate lyase in the presence of different energy sources and inducers. The mutants were grouped into different classes on the basis of their induction ratios with respect to induction by polygalacturonic acid. Effect of growth phase on pectate lyase production by each class of mutants was examined. Pectate lyase synthesized by the wild-type was purified. (ammonium sulphate precipitation) and some properties of the enzyme were examined.Production of pectate lyase in the mutants and the wild-type was inducible, constitutive, catabolite repression-sensitive and amenable to derepression. Pectate lyase synthesized by the wild-type had higher activity than pectate lyase formed by the mutants. However induction ratios of the mutants were higher than that of the wild-type strain. This indicates that the mutants were more strongly induced than the wild-type in the presence of polygalacturonic acid.Four classes of mutants were recognised with respect to their induction ratios. Effect of growth phase on pectate lyase synthesis by the mutants indicated that classes I and IIb and wild-type were partial - growth - phase - dependants (Pgpd). Classes IIa and III were total - growth - phase - dependants (Tgpd). The activity of the	partially purified pectate lease (ammonium sulphate fraction) was stimulated by Ca++, Mg++, Da++, Na+, K and NH+ but inhibited by iodoacetic acid, (EDTA) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 2,4-dinitrophenol. Activity of the enzyme was optimal at pH 9.0 and at 40C.The results of this work offered some information about the regulation of pectate lyase synthesis in Xanthomonas campestris campestris. Such Information could be useful in designing genetical and physiological control measures against plant diseases caused by Xanthomonas campestris campestris and also in the production of pectate lyase for use in some local industries.|Theses Collection|Phytopathogenic bacterium/plant cell walls/pectate lyase/vegetables/polygalacturonic acid/mutants/enzyme/catabolite repression-sensitive/total - growth - phase - dependants (Tgpd) *||||||Bosede, Alfred Olufemi|M|Some results on Banach Algebra whose duals consist of multipliers||||||M.Sc.

The case where the dual is a unital Banach algebra as in the style of Oshobi and Pym (1981) was considered in the sense that the Banach algebra has an identity element e whose norm e  is 1. With this and other certain conditions, it was shown that the dual of such an algebra is isometrically isomorphic to the algebra of continuous left multipliers on the Banach algebra.The case where the algebra is Aren's regular as in Oshobi and Pym (1984) that is, where the two Arens products in it coincide was also considered. Here, it was shown that under certain conditions the dual of such an algebra is a Banach algebra and that its multiplier algebra is the second dual.The case where the algebra has an approximate identity only Oshobi (1986) was investigated. That is, investigation started with a Banach algebra B with an approximate identity of norm I. With the assumption that its dual B' is a Banach algebra such that there exists an injective homomorphism B't B which maps B' onto an ideal in B and A defined to be the B'-closure of (B')2, it was shown that At is the multiplier algebra of A.|Theses Collection|Unital Banach algebra/isomorphic/Aren's regular/injective homomorphism  *||||||Ige, Iyunola Adunni|F|The development of an integrated medical information system||||||Ph.D. Computer Science|S.B.

This delay results in an increased mortality rate. Many patients in Nigeria that could have been saved through prompt medical  attention are lost because of inadequate data processing methods. The methods adopted for gathering, processing, storing and retrieving information are not only inefficient but they also result in serious inaccuracies that fatally endanger the lives of patients. Hence the objective of this research was to develop an integrated computer-based medical information system. The integrated medical information system was developed using the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (OAUTHC) as a test case.The database schema design methodology, developed gave an algorithm that eliminates both transitive dependence and partial dependence from a relation. Thus the use of the algorithm on a relation gives a set of relation schemes that ensures there are no anomalies when the system goes into operation. The database schema design methodology developed in this thesis is applicable to general situations unlike the existing algorithms which are operative only within fixed constraints.This work has successfully applied database approach to medical information handling in a Nigerian hospital. It offered easy storage of data without duplication, quick retrieval of such data and easy exchange of information between the units of the hospital.|Theses Collection|Hospitals/health care delivery/mortality rate/patients/data processing methods/computer/information system/algorithm/database/Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (OAUTHC)/Nigeria  *||||||Jaja, Ngowari|M|Comparative study of the efficiency of some extractants in assessing availability status of P, K, Mg, and Zn in igneous/metamorphic forest soils of South-Western Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The study was conducted with soil samples collected from twenty different locations across the igneous/metamorphic rock zones of south western Nigeria. It involved laboratory and greenhouse experimentations. Soil-test values for available P and plant P-uptake was found to be poorly related to each other for all the extractants (P>0.05). The highest correlation (r = 0.329) was obtained with extractant 9(0.01M EDTA +0.5M CaCl2 + O.1M TEA, pH 7.3). The conventional Bray No. 1 extractant gave a very low correlation.	On the other hand, high correlations (P<0.05) were obtained between K-uptake and the following extractants;1:  Bray No. 1 (0.03N NH4 F + 0.025N HCl) 2:  (1N NH4 OAc pH7)3: (Modified NaHCO3 (0.05N NaHCO3+ O.O1M EDTA pH 8.5).4: (North Carolina Double acid (0.05N HCl + 0.025N H2 SO4 )  5: (New Mehlich (0.2N CH3 COOH + 0.0151 NH4 F + 	0.2N NH4 CI) 6: (1M NH4 HCO3 + O.O1M EDTA pH 7.6)  9: (O.O1M EDTA + 0.05M CaCl2 + O.1M TEA pH  7.3) 10: (O.O1M EDTA + O.O1M CaCl2+ O.1M TEA pH  7.3)and 0.01M EDTA + 0.05M CaCl2 + 0.1M TEA pH 6.0 as extractant B. The resulting correlation analyses with these new extractants did not improve over the earlier analyses. Extractants A and B gave high correlation with Mg uptake (M.05). K uptake correlated positively with extractant A (P<0.05) but not with extractant B (P>0.05).P and Zn had low correlations with both extractants A and B. Therefore, no single extractant had a high correlation for P, K, Mg and Zn simultaneously. However extractant 9 which had high correlations for K and Mg and the highest correlation for P could be used as a simultaneous extractant for P, K and Mg. Zn would then be extracted separately with extractant 7.A correlation analysis was carried out between soil test values and dry matter yield of maize. The result showed a higher correlation (e.g. for Mg r = 0.091-0.501) than that of uptake by maize (e.g. for Mg r=0.964-0.778).

The area was mapped on a scale of 1 : 10,000. Rock types identified include: dark grey cataclaslte, pink-coloured medium grained biotite granite, pink-coloured fine-medium grained granite, aplite and pegmatite and remnants of the surrounding rocks. The rocks and the alkali feldspars separated from them were analysed using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometery (AAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and colourimetric methods. Major element analyses show that the rocks are granites and corundum normative. Trace element abundances B4 (444-826 ppm), Rb (288-358 ppm) and Sr (54-86 ppm) and element ratios Ba/Rb (1.20-3.47), K/Ba (53-1)3), K/Rb (140-183) and Rb/Sr (2.70-7.02) in the rocks taken together with the abundances and ratios in the alkali feldspars separated from them, Ba (200-710 ppm), Rip (461-1702 ppm), Sr (70-120 pre); Ba/Rb (0.12 - 1.54), K/Ba (148 - 658), K/Rb {72 - 222) and Rb/Sr (4.57-1420) suggest that the rocks are magmatic in origin and most likely of crustal parentage. Inter-element relationships, such as K-Rb, Ba - Rb and Rb - Ba -- Sr, in the whole rocks as well as in the alkali feldspar separates, established petrochemical trends which strongly suggest that the rocks were formed from magmas subjected to different degrees of fractionation. The trends show that the dark grey cetaclasite was formed from the least fractionated melt. The pink-coloured medium grained biotite granite and the pink-coloured fine-medium grained granite were formed from melts of intermediate fractionation while the apliteand pegmatites were formed from the most fractionated melts.  Based on the results of this study, it is suggested that the rocks of the Liga Hills are co-genetic and were formed from melts generated through anatexis of crustal materials. The maximum microcline structures (Triclinicity = 0.88 - 1.00) observed in the alkali feldspar separates reflect the long cooling history of the host rocks.|Theses Collection|Geologic mapping/rocks/Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometery (AAS)/X-ray diffraction (XRD)/fractionation/microcline structures/aplite/pegmatites *||||||Aluko, Patrick Ojo|M|Artificial insemination, genetic and cytogenetic studies in two cichlid fishes: Oreochromis Niloticus Linnaeus (Trewavas0 and Sarotherodon Galilaeus (Artedi).||||||P.hD.

Incubation of fertilized eggs was carried out in 500ml beakers. Chromosomes were studied from 12-hour and 40-hour post fertilization embryos. Lactate dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase isozyme patterns were determined by cellulose acetate electrophoresis of thirteen tissue homogenates. HOG was found to be effective in inducing spawning and spermination, while Tilapia pituitary extract was not. Intrageneric and intergeneric inseminations carried out showed that the pattern of embryonic and larval development in the two species and their hybrids were the same. A mean percentage hatchability of 60.1970 was obtained in all inseminations carried out. There were no significant (P > .01) differences in the growth rates of the two species and their hybrids at nine days post hatching.Behaviour of chromosmes in all mitotic stages in 12-hour and 40-hour old embryos of the two species and their hybrids indicated that all diploid species and the hybrids have 2n = 44 chromosomes of basically similar morphology. The gynogenetic hybrids between the two species have a haploid number of n = 22 chromosomes. No chromosomal markers identifying sex chromosmes were found.	Two forms of single nucleolus were observed in O. niloticus but only one form in S. galilaeus and in the hybrids, A low percentage (about 2% aberrations - ring chromosomes, polyploid cells, chromatin connections, dicentric bridges and laggards - were recorded in all stages of mitosis at the ages of 12 hours and 40-hours post - fertilization. The level of aberrations in meiosis of both species was high with clumping having the highest frequency of about 80. Cellulose acetate electrophoretic study or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alcohol dehydrogenase (AM) isozymes of some tissues showed striking similarity in the two species from three water bodies.The results suggest close phylogenetic affinity between the two species and that their hybrids could survive beyond the free swimming stage.|Theses Collection|Gene/ Human Chroionic Gonadotropin (HCG)/fertilization/lactate/Tilapia pituitary extract/inseminations/chromosmes/Cellulose acetate electrophoretic *||||||Ayanwale, Adeolu Babatunde|M|The economics of cassava production in Oyo North area of Oyo State, Nigeria ||||||Ph.D. Agric.

In carrying out the investigation, primary data were collected from cassava farmers and cassava processors selected through a stratified random sampling technique. Data collection involved the use of cost-route method to record detailed input-output ratios, price and other important information for the 1987/88 production season. The data were analysed with the use of budgetary techniques as well as production function approach. Also linear programming techniques were applied to determine the optimum combination of cassava with other farming enterprises in the study area.The result of the analysis revealed that cassava production and cassava processing were profitable enterprises in the study area. The observed levels of profitability were about N516.25 per hectare of cassava cultivated; N745.96 per tonne of cassava tuber processed into cassava flour (lafun); and N730.84 per tonne of cassava tuber processed into gari.The production function analysis revealed that land area, operating capital inputs and family labour were the most significant factors influencing cassava productivity. A further analysis revealed that resource-use efficiency in cassava production can be improved by increasing the area of land planted to cassava intercropped with maize, yam and cowpea and/or through a reduced rate of use of hired labour and operating capital in cassava production.The analysis carried out for cassava processing enterprises revealed increasing returns to scale both for gari and cassava flour (lafun) businesses. The above implied that further expansion of the existing processing scale can lead to better efficiency among cassava processors.The linear programming analysis revealed that the other crop enterprises being planted by the cassava farmers could generate an optimal farm plan which would result in an income of N836.91 per annum after taking care of subsistence as compared with an income of N925.60 per annum obtained from sole cassava cropping.|Theses Collection|Cassava/cultivation/cassava processors/cassava flour (lafun)/gari/cropping*||||||Ayoola, Lawunmi Molara|F|The modality for incorporating computer education into the curriculum of Federal Unity Secondary Schools in Oyo, Ogun, Ondo and Lagos States||||||M.A. Educational Technology|D.K.

This Rap can be reduced by using appropriate maize production technology. This work examines the impact of technology transfer on maize production in Ondo and Oyo States of Nigeria. The technology package examined includes improved maize varieties, chemical fertilizers agrochemical  and agricultural mechanization.Primary data were collected with the use of Questionnaires administered to two sets of  farmers. The first set consists of 100 randomly selected farmers participating in Oyo North Agricultural. Development Project (ONADEP) and the EkitiAkoko Agricultural Development Project (EAADP). The second set of farmers is made up of 100 selected maize farmers who do not participate in the Agricultural Development Projects (ADP) in Ondo and ONTO States. The data were analysed using Chisquare and multiple regression analyses.The result of the analysis revealed that about 32 per cent of maize farmers were not efficient in their use of resources. The ADP farmers used more improved seeds, fertilizers, herbicides,	pesticides and tractors than the non - ADP farmers. Thus the ADP farmers had higher maize productivity and higher returns. Also optimum farm sizes for ADP farmers were 8.05 ha. while that of non  ADP farmers were 2.45ha. It is significant that more than 80 per cent of the farmers operated below these optimum farm sizes. The marginal value productivities derived for all the technological	inputs indicate that their coefficients were higher than the marginal factor cost. This indicates that most of these inputs can still be more intensively utilized in an effort to improve on resource use efficiency. However, some major constraints	were identified as limiting the present use of technological inputs. These constraints include lack of adequate finance, high prices of inputs, poor infrastructures and lack of adequate technical knowledge on the part of the farmers.The policy recommendations advanced to improve the use of the technological inputs in maize production include the provision of credit to facilitate input archase and use, Expansion of extension education, provision of infrastructure by the government, and the need to increase the present farm holdings to attain economically optimal farm sizes.|Theses Collection|Maize/improved maize varieties/chemical fertilizers agrochemical/agricultural mechanization/Oyo North Agricultural.

As a result, their display systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated in an effort to meet with the requirements of the various applications. This has resulted in the extensive use of graphics display systems which place all kinds of facilities at the disposal of the user. This has however increased the workload of the main processor. This additional workload usually results in a marked degradation in the performance of the main processor. To avoid this degradation, graphics display systems are being designed in which the graphics functions are transferred to a dedicated processor in order to free the main processor for the main tasks of the system. This research effort is directed at designing a graphics display system that will maintain a specified image on the display by accepting as input the endpoint of the lines which define an image. It will cause the defined image to be displayed on the display device (raster-scan) and refresh regularly the displayed image and cause any modifications to be reflected on it. A study of display devices and line-drawing algorithms was carried out. A modular design was then adopted which made the system highly flexible and efficient. A dynamic and easily relocatable software system was designed for the Display Ring Processor and most of its facilities are software implemented which thus make them very easy to modify and at the same time ensures that the entire system can. be very easily upgraded. The designed software was loaded into the SDK-85 microprocessor and an IBM PC-XT connected as the host processor. The software was loaded and tested a module at a time because of the limitations of the processing environment of the SDK-85, specifically insufficient memory space. Special flags were included in the software to test that communication and transfer of data between the modules was taking place as required since the allthe software could not be loaded at once. A flag was also used to halt the microprocessor and inspect data meant for the Display Driver since one was not available for use in testing the system.The result showed that using the INTEL 8085 microprocessor as the heart of the Display Ring Processor the output of the main processor was enhanced. However, the use of a more powerful processor than the INTEL 8085 would increase the capabilities that could be buiIt into the Display Ring Processor system substantially. The ultimate aim would be to make the entire system compleletely invisible to the user, with negligible time between input of data and display of the appropriate image on the screen. A logical upgrade to this system would be the inclusion of a transformation module which would enable the system carry out transformations on the displayed image as directed by the user.|Theses Collection|Computers/graphics/algorithms/Display Ring Processor/software/SDK-85 microprocessor/IBM PC-XT/INTEL 8085 microprocessor/transformation module *||||||Ajele, Joshua Oluwafemi|M|Purification and characterization of glutathione S-Transferase from the Giant African snail.

The intermediate hosts of these  parasites are the small water snails in the genus Bulinus. A way of eradicating the disease is by eradicating the intermediate hosts by the use of chemicals. Some of these snails, however, develop resistance to of these chemicals after a long exposure to the chemicals. It is plausible to assume that this resistance might be due to the activities of some detoxicating enzymes such as glutathione transferase. Choosing the giant African snail, Archachatina marginata, as a model snail, this work was undertaken in order to obtain some information about the structure and some kinetic properties of the purified glutathione transferase The basic glutathione transferase was purified, by a combination of ion exchange chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose, adsorption chromatography and gel filtration, to homogeneity. The homogeneity of the purified enzyme was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence and presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate. The subunit molecular weight was estimated be 22,500 - 23,500 daltons by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The apparent molecular weight under non-denaturing condition was 44,000 daltons. The enzyme catalyzed the conjugation of glutathione with 1-chloro-2,4- activities of 47 pmol/min/mg and 38 pmol/min/mg respectively. The enzyme did not catalyze the conjugation of glutathione with 3,4-dichloro-lnitrobenzene and,1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy) propane. The Michealis-Menten constant, Km, of the enzyme for glutathione and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene were 0.23mM and 0.42mM respectively. The isoelectric point (pI) as determined by isoelectric focusing was 8.35. The amino acid composition showed that the enzyme had a relatively high content of the hydrophobic amino acid residues such as alanine, valine and leucine and a relatively high content of the acidic residues such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Inhibition studies on the enzyme with a number of chemical compounds showed that the enzyme was quite unique in its sensitivity to most of the inhibitors tested. Inhibition of the enzyme by N-ethylmaleimide showed that thiol group is essential for the enzyme activity and hence may be present at or near the active site. The enzyme was susceptible denaturation by denaturing agents and was able to regain some of its activity when the denaturing agent was removed. The result of the peptide mapping showed that the snail enzyme possesses at least four cysteine residues per molecule of the enzyme. The enzyme was stable at 25C and up to 40C when it was incubated at these temperatures over a period of 60 minutes. The enzyme was however rapidly deactivated at 50C and above.|Theses Collection|Schisto  soma heamatobium/snail/sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/glutathione transferase/enzyme*||||||Ajayi, Tayo Julius|M|L'AFRIQUE ET LA NOUVELLE CONTESTATION A TRVERS L'INCARCERE DE Y.

Primary texts were analysed but the approach to the research has been both analytical and descriptive.The study shows that the leaders of independent Africa have failed in their duty vis--vis their people. Instead of working towards the development of the newlyindependent states, they ally with their former colonial masters and resort to political and economic exploitation of the messes. It further shows that indepen dent Africa is characterised by corruption, tribalism, arbitrary detention and execution.On the whole, this study reveals that with the bitter denunciation of independent African states and the leader, the overall concern of Dogbe and Monenembo is the development of the African society, the conscientisation, emancipation and the well-being, of the exploited classes.|Theses Collection|Independent African states/maladministration/tyranny/corruption/colonialism/tribalism/arbitrary detention/execution *||||||Nzekwu, Anthony Nwora|M|Studies On The Biology and Life Cycle of  Oedaleus Nigeriensis Uvarov in Nigeria||||||Ph.D Plant Science|A.E.

It is widely distributed across Nigeria but it is a minor pest on crops. The second species, Oedaleus seneqalensis Krauss, is restricted to northern Nigeria where it is a serious pest of crops especially millet. It is interesting that Q. nigeriensis is not a serious pest and only adequate understanding of its biology can explain this minor pest status. This should be advantageous in planning to avoid a possible future outbreak of the insect. Accordingly, various aspects of the biology of the insect were studied. The seasonal breeding cycle and host plant associations were studied along a transect throughout different vegetation zones of Nigeria. The life history of the grasshopper was studied in the laboratory by rearing individuals singly, and several together as a population. The effects of four host plants on the development were also investigated. These included Axonopus compressus P. Beaux, Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers., Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertn and Setaria gracilipes C.E. Hubbard; used singly, and as a mixture of all four to feed the insert. The influence of temperature and relative humidity on development was studied employing 23C, 26C, 29C, 32C and 35C constant temperatures, and 33%, 70%, 80% and 90% constant relative humidities. The field studies showed O. nigeriensis to be associated with 12 species of grasses distributed within 9 genera and 4 tribes. At Ogbomoso, llorin, Toro, Bauchi and Potiskum, two generations exist and they generally overlap. The exact time each generation commenced in the different areas varied in line with the advance of the rains. At lle-lfe, the population was scanty; and apparently one or two generations may be produced. Development was generally optimal when rearing was done on the mixed diet of four grasses. Hence, the developmental period was shorter (60 days compared with 106 - 127 days for single host plants); clutch size was also higher (26 eggs per pod compared to 18 - 20 eggs for single host plants). Polyphagy in the insect is therefore not just opportunistic; rather it is a necessary nutritional requirement for optimal development.Nymphal developmental period was 60 days and 56 days at 26C and 29C respectively, and 10% mortality was observed. It was elongated (81.5 days) at 23C, and mortality was 60%. At 32C, it was much reduced (47.2 days) and mortality was 30%. At 23C, adults laid one egg-pod, but laid three egg-pods at 29C and 32C. Thus, a temperature of 29C appears optimal for development. Nymphal mortality was 70% and 60% at 33% and 90% R.H. respectively. It was most pronounced in the first instar at 33% R.H. and in instars III - V at 90% R.H. It was 10-20% at 70% - 80% R. H. Similarly, adult mortality was 100% and 80% at 33% and 90% R.H. respectively compared to 20% at 70% - 80% R.H. Thus, optimal relative humidity for development is about 70% - 80%. |Theses Collection|Seasonal breeding cycle/grasshopper/Oedaleus nigeriensis Uvarov/Oedaleus Fieber/Oedaleus senegalensis Krauss/Nymphal developmental period/Polyphagy/insect.*||||||Njoku, Clifford Ikechukwu  |M|Computer Aided Design of Binary Batch Plate Distillation Process||||||M.Sc Chemical Engineering|A.N.

The unsteady state nature of batch distillation process makes hand computation of design calculations tedious. Developing computer tools for design and simulation will not only eliminate this problem but also improve the accuracy of results. The computer design program for binary batch distillation proces developed in this work is based on two graphical design methods of binary batch distillation process: McCabe Thiele and Ponchon Savarit methods. The computer program is made up of two parts; design and simulation. The design part of the program estimates the number of stages required for a separation, distillate volume and time expected from such a distillation operation. Also included in the design program are the sizing of the rectifying column based on sieve tray design, and the heat transfer equipment (which includes a total condenser and kettle type reboiler). Constant reflux policy control method is adopted in the process design computations. The simulation part of the program simulates composition variations in the rectifying column with distillation time, considering constant reflux, variable reflux and step reflux control policies. Tabulated enthalpy, concentration data and vapour liquid equilibrium data are directly used in the program. Column liquid hold up was accounted for by an approximate method while actual numbers of distillation stages were estimated by considering tray efficiencies less than 100%.The computer program was run on a micro computer with ethanol, water mixture as distillation feed. The design results show an increase in the number of stages required for distillation with increase in expected distillate purity and decrease efficiency. The effect of column liquid hold-up was found to be stronger for very low initial charge volume, thus requiring more stages for separation. Ponchon Savarit method of design was found to be more sensitive than the McCabe Thiele method. For the simulation of a constant reflux policy operation, it was found that the distillate drawoff has a marked effect on distillation time, product purity, fraction of feed distilled and required number of stages for rectification. However for variable reflux policy operation, distillate drawoff was found to depend on the level of difficulty of separation; decreasing slowly at higher feed compositions and sharply at lower pot compositions. The overall average distillate purity obtainable by step reflux policy operation was found to depend on the cumulative contribution of the different reflux steps. However, it does not necessarily depend on the number of reflux steps but on choice of the reflux ratios and pot composition ranges for the different reflux steps. |Theses collection|Batch distillation/manufacturing of specialty chemicals/McCabe Thiele method/Ponchon Savarit method/reflux policy control/binary batch distillation*||||||Fawole, Ajibola Jelilat|F|Women and Community Bank Credit in Southwestern Nigeria||||||M.Sc Economics|R.O.

This study therefore examines: the role of community banks in southwestern Nigeria in providing direct access to credit for women; constraints militating against female access to community bank's credit and the effects of community bank's credit on women's income, savings and employment. The data used for the study were derived from primary and secondary so~rces. The primary data were obtained with the aid of structured and semi-structured questionnaires administered to 273 successful loan applicants and 38 unsuccessful loan applicants of community bank's credit, from purposively selected occupations in Lagos and Ondo states. Secondary data were obtained from each community bank's credit records. Analytical techniques comprising descriptive statistics such as frequency tables and cross-tabulation were used. Chi-square (x2) test was used to test for significancies in the relationships of the cross-tabulations. Student T - test was used to test for significancies in the mean values of sales, profits and savings of successful and unsuccessful applicants. Information obtained from the twenty community banks in the sample for this study shows that on the average, the ratio of  females (1,188) patronising community banks were less than males (1,954) and women received 28.5% of the total loan disbursed. Results from the primary data indicates that, lack of access to suitable guarantors was the major constraint militating against female access to community bank's credit. other constraints were: irregular operation of account; lack of adequate collateral; dearth of economically viable projects; inability to operate a current account and non-membership of group/association, ~hrough which loans could be guaranteed. A large proportion of applicants used the community bank's credit for income generation purposes such as initiation and expansion of businesses, and majority (87.3%) of them took their loan obligations seriously by paying back their loans within the scheduled time. The community bank's credit had a positive effect on the income and savings of female loan recipients and, as respondents reported, their businesses were preserved (60.1%) while some jobs were created (35.5%). Also, Urban women had more access to community bank~credit than rural women because urban women had better access to information about formal credit. Based on these findings, suggestions were proffered to enhance: female patronage in community banks, access to community bank's credit and productivity of female loan recipients. These .I include: - Massive campaigns by community bank's officials to create awareness by women on community banking operations especially on the process of obtaining credit; - detailed disaggregation of data by sex; - counseling services by bank officials for loan applicants; - formation of women groups to guarantee loans for female loan applicants; and - granting of loans that are large enough to cover business expenses by community bank officials.|Theses collection|Women/Community bank's credit/Community banks/loan.*||||||Kolawole, Emmanuel Babafemi|M|Effectiveness of Chamer's Rule in Solving a 2 x 2 System  of  Linear Equations in Selected Secondary Schools in Ondo State||||||M.A. Mathematics Education|Sola Ehindero||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Mathematics Education|1995|||OAU|||||ix, 116|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

A total of eight hundred students were randomly selected from eight Local Government Headquarters of Ondo State. The four methods were randomly and evenly assigned to the eight secondary schools. There was one control group (Cramer' 8 Rule) and three experimental groups (Elimination method. Substitution Method end Equality Method). The data for the research were collected using ten item achievement tests on a 2 x 2 system of linear equation. The four treatment groups were subjected to Pre-tests/Post-tests and Retention test. The results of these tests were collected and analysed using student-t test statistic and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The result of this study showed that students assigned to Cramer's Rule performed better and retained more than those assigned to Elimination Rule, Substitution Rule and Equality Rule, despite the fact that they have never used Cramer's rule nor heard about it before the treatment. The implication of this study therefore is the need to introduce Matrices and Determinant as new topics in the Secondary School syllabus (JSS - SSS), in addition, there is a need for the inclusion of Cramer's Rule as a new method of teaching a 2 x 2 system of linear equation in Nigerian Secondary School Mathematics.|Theses collection|System of Linear equation/Cramer's rule/Elimination method/Substitution Method/Equality Method/Student-t statistic/Analysis of Variance(ANOVA)/Pre-tests Retention/Post-tests Retention.*||||||Kolawole, Olutoyin Dare|M|Factors Associated With The Discontinuance of  Some Agricultural Innovations Among Farmers In Ekiti North of Ondo State, Nigeria||||||M.Sc Agricultural Extention and Rural Sociology|J.A.

Special emphases were placed on the: identification of the agricultural innovations introduced to farmers in the study area; identification of the innovations which had been adopted and later discontinued by farmers; identification of social and personal factors which are responsible for the discontinuance of the use of innovations among farmers; and analyses of the characteristics of farmers who discontinued the use of the adopted innovations. The study was conducted in five rural communities which were randomly selected out of the thirty-one communities in the area. Structured interview schedule was used to obtain information from one hundred and fifty farmers in the project circle: Thirty farmers were selected in each of the five communities by simple random sampling. Descriptive statistical techniques such as frequency counts, percentages, means, standard deviation and weighted mean score were used to analyse the data. Correlation and regression analyses were used in determining the relationships between the variables investigated in the study. The investigation showed that about seventeen agricultural innovations were introduced into the area since the inception of the World Bank Assisted Agricultural Development Project in Ondo State. The results also showed that all the innovations were adopted except planting of yam minisett and alley farming. All the innovations introduced (except improved maize and homestead fish production) were at one time or the other discontinued by farmers. The investigation revealed that a great proportion of farmers discontinued the use of innovations as a result of lack of funds, lack of inputs and, natural circumstances and hazards. About 88.0% and 81.3% of the farmers were risk-aversive and financially constrained, respectively, hence influencing discontinuance. The study showed positive and significant correlations between discontinuance and sex (r = 0.1875), fatalism (r = 0.3405) and cost-profitability ratio of the innovation (r = 0.2050). Also, negative but significant relationship existed between discontinuance and cosmopoliteness (r = -0.1889), farm size (t= -2.211), relative advantage of the innovation (r = -0.2661), compatibility of the innovation (r = -0.2265) and, availability of the innovation (t = -2.255). |Theses collection|Agricultural innovation/Simple random sampling/Descriptive statistical techniques/World Bank Assisted Agricultural Development Project/yam minisett/alley farming/cosmopoliteness/fatalism/cost-profitability/farm size.*||||||Komolafe, Olaniyi Olusola|M|The Biology of The Fish Oreochromis niloticus in Opa Reservoir, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, Nigeria.||||||Ph.

A comprehensive study on the species was therefore designed to investigate the distribution, food and feeding habits, reproduction and fecundity, age and growth as well as its parasitic infestation Gill-netting and cast-netting methods were used to catch the fish samples. Specimens caught by cast-netting were only used for food and feeding and fish parasite studies while the two fishing methods were employed to study other aspects of the biology of the species. In the laboratory fish measurements were taken while scales were removed from specific locations for age and growth studies. Each fish sample was slit open ventrally from the anus to the pectoral fin and the sex and stage of gonad maturity determined. Mature gonads were weighed and preserved for fecundity studies. The stomach of each fish caught with cast-netting was dissected in the laboratory while the content was weighed and the volume determined and then preserved for food studies. Fresh fish samples were examined in the laboratory by conventional parasitological techniques for external and internal parasites. O. niloticus constituted 33.00% of all fish species caught in Opa reservoir during the period of study. The species was not spatially distributed in the reservoir. 90.5% of the specimens were caught near the reservoir bottom while 68.7% of the total catch was caught within the inshore area of the reservoir. O. niloticus was an omnivore in Opa reservoir. It fed on detritus, higher plant fragments, diatoms, algae and insect remains in a decreasing order of abundance. It was observed that the fish started feeding in the reservoir around 6.00a.m., reaching a peak around 3.00p.rn. and declined until 6.00p.m. O. niloticus of Opa reservoir bred throughout the period of study. The species was found to be a maternal mouth brooder with the female specimens carrying eggs and alevins in their mouths. The sex ratio of O. niloticus in Opa reservoir was 1:0.8. {Male/Female) The fecundity of O. niloticus ranged from 73 eggs to 1810 eggs with a mean of 815 eggs. Annulus formation on the scales of O. niloticus occurred between January and April annually. Male fish specimens grew faster in length than the females.  Growth in length in both sexes of O. niloticus decreased as the fish aged. Fish length and scale length relation- ship gave a statistically significant correlation (r = 0.835; P<0.001) while the fish length-weight relationship gave a statistically significant correlation (r = 0.969; P<0.001). 19.28% of the fish specimens examined were .infested with trematode parasites in the reservoir. Neascus sp, Clinostomum tilapiae and an acanthocephalan which infested O. niloticus specimens seemed not to have any serious adverse effect on them. Although gillnets with various mesh sizes could be used for catching O. niloticus specimens, a stretched mesh size of 10.2 cm was recommended for the proper exploitation of the fish species in Opa reservoir. |Theses collection|Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus)/the distribution, food and feeding habits, reproduction and fecundity/Gill - netting and Cast - netting methods used to catch Fish samples/Opa reservoir/annulus formation/Neascus sp, Clinostomum tilapiae/acanthocephalan*||||||Jemilugba, Margaret Olusolape|F|Effects of Advance Organisers in The Achievement and Retention of Student Nurses in Selected Concepts in Human Biology||||||M.A. Ed.

Gender and type of Nursing schools were other variables examined in this study.Six hypotheses were generated for the study. The experimental design used in the study was a pre-test post-test control group type. A 50 item multiple choice test administered to both experimental and control groups was used in the study.Subjects for the study were 160 basic student nurses in the first half of their first year in three Schools of Nursing in Ondo and Osun States of Nigeria. Subjects ranged from 1830 years with the mean age of 21 years. The subjects were randomly assigned to two equivalent groups which were also stratified by gender. Each group contained 80 subjects The two groups were pretested and the experimental group was taught the introductory passage which served as the Advance Organizer., Both groups were next taught the selected concepts as contained in human biology textbook for nurses. The experimental and the control groups were later post tested immediately and two weeks after.The data collected was subjected to ttest analysis. All hypothesis were tested at 0.05 level of significance. The result showed that Advance Organizers facilitated achievement and retention more among the experimental group than the control group. The result of the study also showed that there was a statistically significant difference in the achievement and retention of mole and female student nurses in the organizing group. The male student nurses exhibited higher achievement and retention than the females. A significant difference in favour of student Nurses in Federal Schools of Nursing was also recorded.The result of this study showed that the effect of Advance Organizer on retention was statistically significant among the experimental group. This finding confirmed that the main thrust of the effect of Advance Organizer therefore is on retention which is crucial to transfer of knowledge in Nursing EducationThe study recommended the use of Advance Organizer in the teaching of Human Biology in Nigerian Nursing Schools.|Theses collection|Advance Organisers/Student Nurses/Retention on Biological Concepts/Nursing Schools/Human Biology/Nigerian Nursing Schools*||||||Bamikole, Lawrence Ojo|M|A Philosophical Analysis and Critique of Political Violence.||||||Ph.D. Philosophy|Oladipo Fashina||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Philosophy|1995|||OAU|||||xi, 317|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The thesis also attempted to formulate a theory of political violence which is expected to provide an adequate basis for the moral justification of political violence. Finally, the thesis examined the realities of Nigerian politics, using as its basis the analysis of the concept of political violence.The methodology employed was the critical and conceptual analysis of existing philosophical literature on political violence and democracy. The thesis found that political violence is not only compatible with liberal democracy, but can also be justifiably used to transcend liberal democracy and therefore to establish a more fulfilling form of democracy. The thesis also found that at the base of political violence in Nigeria is the pluralist nature of the country and the inability of the ruling class to harness the value of pluralism to fashion out a unified Nigerian nation.The thesis concluded that political violence is sometimes justified under certain conditions of injustice and that political violence will remain in human societies until governments recognize and make the principle of justice a cornerstone in the act of governance.|Theses collection|Political Violence/Philosophical Analysis/Critique/Human Rights/Police Brutality/Robert Paul Wolff/Utilitarianism*||||||Bamidele, Timothy Bola|F|Financial Mobilisation Effort of The Federal Government of Nigeria,1970 -1988||||||Ph.D. Economics|A.O.

It has also been agreed among economists that inadequacy of funds has been the bane of growth and development of these economies. Most of them have resorted to stop gap measures which rely heavily on external financial resources to resolve the problem, disregarding the efficient exploitation of the available potential resources within their domestic frontiers. Prevailing international circumstances have however forced them to now look inwards and endorse endogenous supply of funds for development. The focus of this study is therefore to investigate the degree of mobilization of the available financial resources by the Federal Government of Nigeria within the period of 1970 to 1988. That is, to determine the taxable capacity and tax effort of the Federal Government for that period and to proffer suggestions to minimize revenue gap.Available studies were on cross - country and highly aggregated basis. This study provides a specific country approach which facilitates a less aggregative method of determining and analysing taxable capacity and tax effort by individual revenue source. Based on the fact that the GDP is the totality of all economic activities of a nation from where taxes could be obtained, and that the potential tax (or taxable capacity) is a function of potential GDP, the potential tax was estimated using three approaches viz, the constant growth rate, the targeted growth rate and the Okun's law equation approaches. Both taxable capacity and tax effort of the nation were estimated before being disaggregated by revenue source. Tax effort index was obtained by simple ratio of actual tax collection of the taxable capacity.The result of the potential GDP showed a permanent gap between actual and potential GDP, while reasons, linked with underdevelopment, aggregate supply shocks and demand side disturbances were adduced to account for the GDP gap. The results of the aggregate tax effort showed that the mean tax effort index of the Federal Government of Nigeria ranged between 0.28 and 0.51 during the study period. Oil boom periods however exhibited high tax effort indices. Individual revenue sources also exhibited the same traits and no revenue source exhibited any impressively high tax effort index except during the oil boom years. Evidences showed that there was a wide gap between actual and potential revenue of the Federal Government both aggregatively and by revenue source. This proves that large idle and unexploited resources were still left in the various revenue sources of the Federal Government during that period. The observed GDP gap and the consequent revenue gap is suggestive of an imminent revenue gap which should be pre-empted. Also, the low tax effort index observed implies the need for allocating more resources to the public sector through strategies which are capable of transferring economic surplus to the public sector.|Theses Collection|Economic Development/Developing Economics/Federal Government of Nigeria/Mobilisation/Financial Resources/Taxable Capacity/Potential GDP/Low Tax Effort Index.*||||||Balogun, Adeoye Lambe|M|Farmers Perception and Adoption of  Alley Farming Technology in Osun State||||||M.Sc Agricultural Extension and Rural Sociology|L.A.

Some of the specific objectives of this study were: to identify the farmers sources of information on alley farming technology; how farmers perceive alley cropping; identify the constraints facing the farmers in adopting the alley farming and to recommend, based on the result of findings of this study, alternative methods that can enhance the acceptance and adoption of alley farming in the state.To achieve the stated objectives, data were collected from the village extension agents, the programme farmers and non-programme farmers (contact farmers inclusive) in the fifteen (15) selected local government areas of the state. Questionnaires and structured interview schedule were designed, printed and administered to the respondents. Thirty village extension agents answered and returned the questionnaires administered to them. Similarly, all the 128 farmers interviewed answered their interview scheduled accordingly. The farmers and the extension agents were from Ayedade, Ayedire, Awo, Boripe, Ede, Egbedore, Ife- Centre, Ifelodun, Ife - South, Ila, Irepodun, Irewole, Obokun, Oriade and Osogbo covering all the six administrative zones in the state. Altogether, one hundred and fifty eight respondents were used for data collection. The data were analysed using frequency distribution and percentages,.The result of the findings revealed that though the farmers   practice. The adoption rate among the respondent farmers is still far below expectation. It is about 18 percent if one considers the time the technology has been developed in the country.The study also revealed that the efforts of the extension agents need to be intensified in scope and area of coverage so as to reach, visit and train more farmers. This could be done by increasing the numberof village extension agents. It was recommended that the farmers must have access to accurate information, appropriate seeds and seedlings for hedgerow establishment, potential benefits of alley farming in all its ramifications and its economic benefits if it is to be widely practiced. In addition the practice must be actively and aggressively be promoted by the.

It is effectively controlled using synthtic insecticides. Demerits such has high cost, toxicity (to handlers) and insect resistance associated with synthetic chemicals have led to the suggestion of using insecticides from of plant origin.By hydrodistillation, air-dried leaves of Ageratum Conyzoides L. yielded 0.9% of the volatile oil. The toxic effects of the oil on both sexes of the adult insects during 24hr was derermined. By fumigation experiment, it was observed that mortality increased gradually from an initial dose of 5ul/75ml container and reached a comparable level of 95% (LD50 22.9ul) and 97% (LD50 25.1ul) for the males and females respectively. The LD50 values suggested that male adults were more susceptible to the toxic effects of the oil than female adults.In the determination of the effect of the oil on oviposition and adult emergence on stored cowpea seeds, complete inhibition of oviposition (at 14 days after treatment) was not evident upon fumigation of infested cowpea seeds with different doses of the oil up to 60ul. On the other hand, complete inhibition of adult emergence (at 40 daysafter treatment) was obtained in seeds treated with a minimal dose of 20ul oil, A dose of 10 ul/9.5g swwds also produced marked decrease in ovipositon (compared with the number of eggs laid at this dosage).The effectiveness of the volatile oil as a fumigant was compared to that of a commercial fumigant (aluminium phosphide). The synthtic fumigant was found to reduce oviposition significantly at doses of 0.1 - 2.0mg/9.5g seeds in comparison with the untreated control, but ineffective in reducing emergence when compared with acetone-treated control. These effects were found to decrease with period of storage of cowpea after oil treatment.Precocene I (97.1mg/ml oil) and an unknown compound (50.9mg/ml oil) were isolated as the major constituents of the volatile oil. While precocene I inhibited both oviposition  (at 10ul) and adult emergence (at 2.5ul), the unknown compound exhibited no significant activities within the dose levels tested (0.5 - 10.0 ul).For complete protectoin of 100kg (one bag of cowpea, 105.3ml of the volatile oil would be required either as a fumigant or as seed protectant, while 26.4ml of precocene I would be needed using the latter method.The physical charateristics of the seed (percentage holed seed and percentage weight loss) were not adversely affected when compared with their respective controls.|Theses Collection|Callosobruchus maculatus F./insect pest of cowpea/Vigna unquiculata s.sp. unguiculata/hydrodistillation/air dried leaves of Ageratum conyzoides L./oviposition/adult insects.*||||||Akinyele, Olufunke Ibitola|F|Effects of Rational Emotive Therapy on the Superstitious Beliefs Among Secondary School Students in Osun State, Nigeria||||||M.A. Guidance and Counselling|K.A.

The main objectives of the study were to determine the efficacy of RET in treating superstitious beliefs and to find out whether variables such as sex, age, subject specialization and religion could significantly affect the effectiveness of the therapy. Subjects (N60) were drawn from a cluster of adolescents in a Secondary School in Osun State (age x = 16). The subjects' pre-test scores on Index of Superstitious Beliefs Scale developed by the researcher were used in determining their superstition levels. The same instrument was administered on the subjects after treatment for the purpose of collecting post-test data.Ellis' Rational Emotive Therapy (1962) principles were adopted as the treatment strategy in the experimental group. The treatment programme was made up of seven sessions. Each session lasted for one hour. The therapy spanned three and half weeks. Data were analysed using student t - test statistics and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Five hypotheses were tested in the study. The first hypothesis was rejected (t = 7.67; P <.05) thereby showing that RET is efficacious in reducing the superstitious beliefs of treated subjects. The second hypothesis was upheld(t = 1.28; P <.05). This therefore gives the evidence that no gender difference was observable in the effect of RET on both male and female subjects in the experimental group.The third hypothesis was equally upheld (t = 0.74; P<.05). Thus showing that age did not affect the efficacy of RET. The fourth hypothesis was also confirmed (f = 2.48; P<.05). This attested to the fact that subjects of specialization did not affect the efficacy of RET in any way. The fifth hypothesis was also confirmed (t = 0.29; P<.05). This therefore provided the evidence that religion has no particular effect on the efficacy of RET in reducing the superstitious beliefs of the subjects treated.|Theses Collection|Rational Emotive Theraph (RET)/Superstitious beliefs of secondary school students/Osun State/Index of Superstitious beliefs scale/Ellis' Rational Emotive Therapy.*||||||Awa, Ayodele Victor|M|Organization of  African Unity (OAU) and The Challenges of Conflict Management in The 1990s||||||M.Sc.

Significantly, the search for peace and security in the international system has for long remained the major pre-occupation of statesmen and intellectuals alike. It has also found expression in the birth of various crises preventing multilateral regimes (ie. the concert of Europe, the League of Nations and the United Nations of our time.) The elusiveness of peace and security even within these contexts has equally led to the emergence of regional arrangements and organizations aimed at arresting the propensity for nation states to resort to war in a semi-primitive international system. This study critically evaluates the Organization of African Unity's (OAU) efforts in regional conflict resolution and the challenges of conflict management in the 1990s in the light of the emergence of new forms of intra and inter-state conflicts in Africa in the post cold war era.Data for the study were obtained from two main sources: primary source and secondary source. Our primary source includes official documents and reports from the OAU Secretariat and by the OAU Secretary General, speeches by Foreign Ministers of member states, the United Nation's charter, the OAU's charter, official gazettes as well as Reports commissioned by the OAU. They were complemented by secondary sources of information, such as books, articles in Journals, Magazines and Newspapers.The study finds that conflicts in the international system in general and, in Africa in particular, are complex and manifold, and that they form an integral part of social formations and interactions. Their causes are also multifaceted. Consequently, their management and resolution do not subscribe to any single stereotyped conflict management theory.The study suggests several strategies for effective regional conflict management by the OAU in the 1990s and beyond. It concludes that a revitalized and reinvigorated OAU, adequately funded and equiped, offers the best hope, especially within the context of 'try Africa first' approach, of effective regional conflict management and resolution in the 1990s and beyond.|Theses Collection|Multilateral regimes/Organisation of African Unity/conflict management/inter-state conflicts/international system/peace and security.*||||||Ajayi, Olajide Adedayo|M|A Study of The Distribution of Microorganisms In The Surface Water and Sediment of The Lagos Lagoon||||||M.Sc| K.

The specific objectives of the research are to isolate and identify microorganisms in the surface water and sediment samples collected from 24 stations, to relate the occurrence of the microbes to some physical and chemical properties of the surface water and to determine the in vitro antibiotic sensitivity profiles of the isolates recovered from these sites.	The physical and chemical properties of surface water were determined using standard techniques. PH and temperature of water collected from the sampling point were relatively stable. The salinity and conductivity of the water were high during the month of February. The chloride content determined by Mohr titration method was within permissible level of 250mg/l specified by WHO. The calcium content was high, the average recorded ranged from 138.68mg/l to 151.28mg/l for the periods of sampling collection.	Filter paper method was used for suspended solid (SS). (TOC) was estimated by UV absorbance at 254mm on filtered samples. The SS value ranged from 15,37mg/l to 45.98mg/l while the TOC value ranged from 15.31mg/l to 17.16mg/l for the months of February and June respectively.	Bacillus spp (31.21%) wee the predominant bacteria isolated from the lagoon. Other Bacillus isolates recovered were Bacilluss magaterium (16.76%) and Bacillus polymyxa (4.62%) Klebsiella sp. accounted for 9.25% and Enterobacter sp.9.25% while Escherichia coli constituted 8.99% of the total bacteria isolates. Veillonella sp. accounted for 2.89%. streptococcus sp. Proteus Vulgaris   and Pseudomonas sp constituted 1.73% each, of the total isolates. Other organisms encountered were Aeromonas Hydrophila subspecies anaerogenes (1.16%),Bifidobacterium adolescentis (0.57%) and Moraxella bovis (0.57%)	The results showed that low bacteria counts were recorded for the surface water compared with the sediment in which relatively high bacterial counts were recorded.	The in vitro antibiotic sensitivity tests revealed that 60% of the bacteria isolate showed multiple antibiotic resistances.  This is epidemiologically significant in that these resistant isolates may be difficult to control in the event of human infections. Since these organisms are also distributed in the surface water they are likely to contact minate marine organisms and if inadvertently consumed by this population, the resistant isolates may be difficult to treat. The study suggests routine monitoring of the lagoon water for sustainable economic and ecological development.|Theses Collection|Lagos Lagoon/Micro organism in The Surface Water/ in vitro antibiotic sensitivity Profiles/Salinity and conductivity/Suspended solid/ Bacilluis spp/Low bacteria count/Multiple antibiotic resistance/Marine Organism.*||||||Akinnawonu, Benson Monehin|M|Teleological Explanations, Causal Explanation and The Problem of  Reduction||||||M.A. Philosophy|Oladipo Fashina||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Philosophy |1995|||OAU||||||||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The study also verifies whether or not structural shift occurred in the industrial sector as a result of the introduction of structural adjustment programme in mid 1986.The analytical technique specifies the relationships between the major industrial variable such as output, employment, and profits and the quantifiable aspects of the structural adjustment programme. Primary data were collected from the manufacturing industries by the use of a questionnaire. The secondary data were obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria and Federal Office of Statistics. Applying the least squares techniques parameter estimates was derived.The results of the interview show that the adjustment programme adversely affected profitability, output, productive capacity, employment and production costs of all categories of manufacturing industries. However, the effects were more intense in the producer good industries than in the consumer goods ones. The major shocks identified in the study include increased cost of capital, increased prices of domestic raw materials and changes in tariff system. Manufacturing industries became more cautious in decision making and adopted the following strategies to adapt to the shocks posed by the adjustment programme. These strategies include prudent financial management, reduction in labour force, increase in the unit price of output, improvement in the quality of their production and reduction in their stock of inventories.The results equally indicated that exchange and interest rates have adverse effects on the performance of the industrial sector through their effects on the costs of raw materials both imported and locally sourced which in turn adversely affects the level of prices, sales, capacity utilization, employment and profitability. The liberalisation policies instead of enhancing increased production precipitated high cost of production as well as unit price and thus decrease in capacity utilization.Finally, the structural shift tests show that structural shift occurred in the industrial sector with the introduction of the structural adjustments programme. In all, only few manufacturing industries especially the consumer good ones have benefitted marginally for the adjustment programme. Majority of the manufacturing industries were adversely affected by the programme.Based on these findings, there is there is need for government to intervene in the economy by moderating the exchange and interest rates. Likewise, industries with high local content particularly the consumer goods ones should be protected while local production of flat steel sheet, minerals among others should be increased to reduce the high import coefficienct of the capital goods sector in terns of raw materials.|Theses Collection|Structural Adjustment Programme/Nigerian Economy/Central Bank of Nigeria/Federal Office of StatisticsStructural Shift Tests/Capacity Utilisation/Employment/Profitability/Liberalisation Policy*||||||Akinlua, Akinsola Akin|M|Effectiveness of a Mathematics Correspondence Instruction On the Vocational Skills of Junior Secondary School Graduate Aprrentices in Ondo State, Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Corriculum Studies|S.M.

The Subjects were randomly selected according to the type of their workshops, masters' formal educational background and numbers of apprentices in their workshops. The experimental groups were given a treatment which was the Mathematics correspondence instruction for industrial vocations (MIV). Four instruments were used to test the performances of the subjects. One of them was a 25-item multiple choice mathematics achievement test (MAT) which was developed and validated by the researcher. The other three were selected government trade test (GTT). Twelve research assistants were involved to see that the correspondence instructional material was used. Tests were administered the same day at all workshops.At P=0.05 significant level, analysis of the data showed that there were significant differences between the performances of the experimental and control groups in the Mathematics post test and the trade tests. Specifically, the apprentices who studied the Mathematics correspondence instruction performed significantly better in their trade tests and in the Mathematics post tests than those who did not. The null hypotheses which stated that there is no significant difference between the Mathematics main gain scores of the experimental and control groups" was rejected because the experimental group performed better than the control group. Also the hypotheses which state that "there is no significant relationship between subjects' performances on Mathematics and trade tests" was rejected because the result revealed a positive correlation between their performances in both tests. It was however upheld that there is no significant correlation between their performances in Mathematics' tests and trade tests and also between Junior Secondary School III Mathematics certificate grades and trade test grades.|Theses Collection|Effectiveness of Mathematics Correspondence Instruction/Trade Tests/Mathematics Achievement test/Governent Trade Test/*||||||Akinbola, Akinola Adeyi|M|Development of Some Dry Soup Mixes From Some Selected Local Soups||||||M.Sc.

There are varieties of traditional local soups in Nigeria, and other African countries. The soups require much effort and time to prepare. The advantage of dry soup mixes is the convenience offered the customer. The study was therefore aimed at producing dry soup mixes based on selected local soups; and to study the keeping qualities and acceptabilities of the soup mixes.Four different local soups were developed as dry soup mixes. The soups were Vernonia leaf, Ribiscus esculentus, Vigna unguiculata and Arachis hypogea. They were produced as blends of ingredients dried at temperatures not exceeding 58oC.The reconstitution ratios of the soups were 1:6 for Hibiscus esculentus. 1:5 for Vernonia leaf and 1:4 for Vigna unguiculata and Arachia hypogea. Appearance, colour mouthfeel/thickness and taste of the reconstituted soups were acceptable to a sensory panel. Equilibrium water activities for safe storage of the soup mixes ranged from 0.08 to 0.31. The keeping qualities of the soup mixes determined by the free fatty acid and peroxide value changes for eight weeks showed the Arachia hypogea and Vigna unguiculata soup mixes were more stable than Vernonia leaf and Hibiscus esculentus soup mixes.The maximum free fatty acid values as percent oleic acid detected for the soup mixes were 1.10  0.02 for Arachia hypogea, 1.64  0.11 for Vigna unguiculata, 1.15  0.03 for Hibiscus esculentus and 1.14  0.04 for Vernonia leaf at 28  1oC ambient temperature. The maximum peroxide values as meg/peroxides per kg of fat detected for the soup mixes were 1.8  0.1 for Vigna unguiculata, 2.2  0.05 for Arachia hypogea, 5.6  0.00 for Vernonia leaf and 6.4  0.04 for Hibiscus esculentus at 28  1oC.|Theses Collection|Traditional Local Soup/Dry Soup Mixes/Reconstitution Ratio/Equilibrium Water Activities/Free Fatty Acid and Peroxide Value/*||||||Akande, Dorcas Mofoluwake|F|Reptition as a Major Linguistic-Stylystic Devicxe in the Poetry of Louis Macneice||||||M.A. English|C.O.

Underlying the study was the assumption that the use of the two broad types of repetition irregular or free repetition and parallelism - was widespread in poetry in English.This work was done from the perspective of linguistic stylistics, which a method of literary interpretation that seeks to examine literary language linguistically and then relate it to its artistic functions in the text in question. A collection of the poems of MacNeice was first read through carefully, and then four poems considered to be representative of the use of repetition  in the poems were selected for in-depth study. The four poems were 'Prognosis', 'Apple Blossom' `The Gone-Tomorrow' and 'Prayer Before Birth'. In the analysis and interpretation of each of the poems, attention was focused on the ways in which repetition has been mate use of. This mination  involved the identification, classification and discussion of the different types of sentence, clause and group patterns manifested in each poem.It was found that it was the examples of syntactic parallelism that stood out prominently in each of the four poems. It was also these examples of syntactic parallelism that are thus foregrounded in the poems. The syntactic patterns repeated in the poems are of different types. For instance, the study found that in 'Prognosis', the PSPCC, P?S?P?P?, P?S?PC and P?S?PAAstructures are repeated: In 'Apple Blossom' it was the and the  and the  structures of the sentence on the one hand, and the SPCA and ASPC structures of the clause that were repeated. In the Gone Tomorrow',	thesyntactic structures repeated were only at the  level of the group. Thus, it was the mh, mhq and hq structures that were repeated in the poems. The study also found that the syntactic patterns repeated in 'Prayer Before  Birth' were the  and  structures of the sentence on the one hand and the PSPAC, vcSPAlIPC, ASPC, VocSPCAA and the P?S?PCC structures of the clause on the  other. The Variety and complexity Of the structures repeated in this last poem makes the poem the most complex of all the four poems studied in this thesis.|Theses Collection|Use of Repetition/Irregular or Free Repetition and Parallelism/Linguistics Stylistics/Literary interpretation/Prognosis/Apple/Syntactic Parallelism/*||||||Akande, Michael Ojo|M|A Comparative Study of The Efficiency of Rock Phosphate as a Fertilizer Source on The Growth and Yield of Maize (Zea mays.

TZSRY) was carried out on Iwo soil series (Oxic Tropudalf) in the field. The initial and residual effects of the two sources of P were assessed in 1989 and 1990 early cropping seasons respectively. The treatments consisted of the control, the two P sources applied at the rates of 25, 50, 100, 200 kg P2O5/ha and their mixtures in equal rations at the rates of 13.25 and 26.25 kg P2O5/ha.The available P was readily released from SSP while it was slowly released from SRP in the first year of trial. In the second year, however, the SRP supplied significantly higher P than SSP. The effectiveness of different rates of SRP in increasing maize grain yields followed the order of SRP25>SRP50.> SRP100 > SRP200 in the initial experiment while in the residual effects the trend was as follows:SRP50>SRP100 = SRP200> SRP25. The optimum grain yields of 5.9 and 5.1 tonnes/ha were obtained with SSP at the rates of 50 and 100 kg P2O5/ha in 1989 and 1990 respectively. The optimum grain yield could not be ascertained in the initial (1989) experiment for SRP, but in the residual (1990) effects, it was 4.9 tonnes/ha at the rate of 50 kg P2O5/ha.The relative agronomic efficiency values ranged from -500 to 0% and -150 to 100% in the initial and residual experiments respectively. This indicates that Sokoto rock phosphate was more effective in supplying P for maize growth in the second than in the first year of the experiment.|Theses Collection|Sokoto Rock Phosphate/Water Soluble Single Super Phosphate/Optimum Grain Yield/Relative Agronomic Efficiency Value*||||||Siyanbola, Adewale Tajudeen|M|Participation of Women in Agricultural and Rural Development Projects in Osun State of Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Agricultural Extension and Rural Sociology|A.A.

Though women play significant and vital roles in social and economic development, many of these roles are not credited to them because of some socioeconomic, political, religious, attitudinal and other reasons. In agricultural and rural development, womens roles are invaluable. Women are active agricultural producers, processors and marketers. They are active in other non-agricultural rural development projects including the construction of roads and other public utility. The aim of this study, therefore, was to examine the participation of women in agricultural and rural development projects with a view to determining those factors that enhance or inhibit their participation. Data were collected from 282 randomly selected women participants in 238 agricultural and 205 non-agricultural in 24 communities in Osun State of Nigeria. Structured interview schedule duly pretested and validated was used to collect data between July and November, 1993. The study showed that women participated more in cooperative (34.08%) and group farming (31.93%) activities in agricultural development projects and environmental sanitation (29.27%) in non-agricultural rural development projects. Majority of the agricultural (52.94%) and non-agricultural (53.66%) projects were community-sponsored. Local and State governments contributed few projects. Federal and International agencies had little impact. The socioeconomic standard of the women who were mostly farmers (39%), traders (31.90%) and civil servants (12.11%) was low. The average year of schooling was about 5 and average annual income N1,442.52. Women farmers interviewed were not planting tree crops neither were they keeping much livestock. Majority took part in farm tasks such as harvesting, weeding, processing and marketing which are less strenuous than land preparation operations. Change agents introduced most (62.41%) of the projects studies. The more frequently used method of teaching the women was group meeting. Community attitude towards women was found to be largely neutral. Positive and significant relationships were found at 0.05 level of significance between women participation in agricultural and rural development projects and position of respondents among other wives (r = 0.258); number of children (r= 0.119); size of farmland (r= 0.299); years of schooling (r = 0.213), and social participation (r = 0.369). The more these factors were present, the more women participated in communal projects. Age (r = 0.106), income (r= 0.050) and cosmopoliteness (r = 0.041) were not significant. Community leadership (r= 0.314) and attitude towards women (r = 0.331) were also significantly associated with women participation. |Theses Collection|Women Problems/Social Research/Agriculture and Rural Development/Cooperative and Group farming/Environmental Sanitation/Socioeconomic Standard of Women/Land Preparation Operations.*||||||Torimiro, Dixon Olutade|M|Evaluation of Forms of Communication on the Adoption of Improved Agricultural Technologies by Farmers under Ogun State Agricultural Development Project in Nigeria ||||||M.Sc.

Emphasis is place on identification of the farmers' 'and extension workers' characteristics; identification of the forms of communication used by the OGADEP extension workers and their basis of selection; identification of the improved agricultural technologies heard by the OGADEP farmers under some selected food crops and their sources of knowledge of these technologies; determination of the effectiveness of the forms of communication using the adoption level; and examination of the reasons for not adopting innovations the farmers have know~ about through the extension agents. The study was conducted in two area divisions in Ogun State, out of the four area divisions in the State. Structured interview schedule was used to collect information from one hundred and sixty (160) full-time male farmers in the project areas, while structured questionnaire was completed by all the Ogun State ADP's extension agents. Fourblocks under the two area divisions and one hundred and sixty (160) farmers were selected using the simple random sampling technique. Descriptive statistical techniques like frequency counts and percentage were used to analyse the data. Correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between the variables investigated in the study. The results showed that majority of the extension workers found spoken forms (farm visit, result demonstration and general meeting) and visual forms (meeting of result demonstration and method demonstration meeting) as the most appropriate and effective forms for disseminating all the improved agricultural technologies to farmers. About 78% of the extension workers selected their forms of communication based on the number of farmers to be reached, nature of message disseminated and stage of adoption of the farmers. The study revealed that about ten packages were introduced under each of the considered improved technologies viz: - improved maize, cassava cuttings, cowpea, rice and yam to the farmers by the OGADEP extension agents since their inception in 1986. Only about 50% of the farmers in Ogun State have adopted more than twenty-one improved packages of the total of fifty disseminated to them, hence farmers' level of adoption was average. The study showed positive and significant correlation between number of forms of communication used and the extension workers' years of last in-service training (r = O.3494). The adoption of recommended practice and farmers' family labour (r = O. 2194) and farmers' farm size(r = O. 2300).

Attention is focused on the distinct conceptions of justice proposed by the welfarists, as expounded by John Rawls in the difference principle and the libertarians' attempt, represented by Robert Nozick's entitlement theory to refute the welfarist conception. Furthermore, this thesis examined, against Nozick's position that patterning considerations have no role to play in distributive, justice, the arguments for the distribution of social goods according to needs.  The methodology employed in this study was a combination of conceptual analysis and argumentation. The major arguments raised in John Rawls' A Theory of Justice, Robert Nozick's Anarchy, State and Utopia, as well as philosophy journals and commentaries, were examined. This thesis found that none of the theory of distributive justice standing by itself could constitute an adequate theory of justice. The entitlement principles have a role play in justifying the distribution of holdings. But the entitlement theory does not by itself, provide an adequate account of distributive justice; a theory that takes the consideration of needs into account is equally important. This thesis concludes that what is needed is a theory of distributive justice that takes both the entitlement principles and needs into consideration.|Theses Collection|Libertarian and Welfarist Arguement/Patterning Consideration/Anarchy State and Utopia/Theory of Justice/Entitlement Theory*||||||Aileme, Joanne Dada|F|The Effect of Light and Nutrient Stresson the Growth, Yield and Photosynthetic Apparatus of Cowpea||||||M.Sc.

Cowpea seeds were grown in pretreated sand and watered with distilled water until the plants were established. A group of plants were nutrient- stressed by administering 100ml of complete nutrient solution once in four days while plants grown under shade were considered as light-stressed. The nutrient solution if administered once in two days was considered adequate for the plants and adequate light was obtained in the direct natural sunlight. In plants grown in full sunlight, there was enhanced biomass, root:shoot ratio, leaf area. duration, unit leaf rate, relative growth rate, photosynthetic pigment accumulation and seed yield. In the shade condition however all the above parameters except the leaf area ratio and leaf weight ratio were reduced. The plants in the shade also had altered plant habit, a delay in nodule formation while more leaves were produced. Nutrient-stress caused a reduction in all the above parameters except the root:shoot ratio. Under the shade and when nutrient was limiting, the photosynthetic pigments were not able to adapt to shade condition. A delay in the reproductive phase was noticed when both light and nutrients were limiting, but the cycle was of a shorter duration when nutrient alone was limiting. It can be concluded that cowpea respond to light and nutrient stress through altered plant habit, pigment accumulation and reduced seed yield. |Theses Collection|Light and Nutrient Strenght/ Pigment Accumulation/Root:Shoot Ratio/Leaf Area Duration*||||||Ajamu, Thomas Kayode|M|An Analysis of Denominationalism in the Deeper Christian Life Ministry and the House-To-House Prayer Ministries||||||M.A. Religious Studies|M.A. Ojo||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Religiuos Studies|1995|||OAU|||||viii, 97|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The thesis examined the processes and factors promoting denominationalism. It also identified the manifestations of denominational tendencies in the areas of doctrinal emphases, religious practices, membership and organizational structure, as well as the general outlook of these two Charismatic organizations.The study utilised the phenomenological and historical approaches for its methodology. The historical approach was based on the analysis and interpretation of primary sources, such as newsletters, Bible Study outlines, recorded sermons, etc. In addition, relevant secondary literature including books, journal and newspapers reports were consulted. The phenomenological approach involved the participation in and observation of some activities of the two organizations studied by the investigator.The study established that denominationalism is almost irresistible for Charismatic organizations that embark on evangelism and territorial expansion. This is because in the process of preserving their converts, denominational apparatuses, such as the institution of Sunday worship services, the employment of paid ministers, and structures to cater for the social needs of members, etc. will inevitably emerge.

Primary data were collected from poets and chanters in Ise-Ekiti, Ado-Ekiti, Ikole-Ekiti and Itaji_Ekiti. Many oral poets, chanters and singers in these towns were interviewed on the analysis and implications of allusions in their lineage poetry.The in-depth study of allusions in lineage poetry of the Ekiti-Yoruba is the focus of this study. The aim of the research is to open up a new area of research into Yoruba oral literature, especially poetry. Although, there have been studies on Oriki and/or oriki orile, not much attention seems to have been paid to the study of allusions and their analysis in such works.Library research was conducted with a view to cross-checking facts and/or claims made by informants. Relevant mimeographs, journals, theses and books relating to the research work were read and valuable information was deduced from them. The data collected were analysed in order to know the degree of allusions in the poetry of' each lineage, and selected allusions were analysed in order to know the meaning and the implication of each allusion.The study examined the concept of allus1on and its functions. It also examined its nature, its types, and structure, and its pattern of occurrence. The definitions of lineage poetry as given by some scholars were also examined. It is through the attempt made to analyse most of the allusions in each lineage poetry, that light was shed on the folklore of each lineage.The findings revealed that an in-depth study of oriki orile by way of analysing and interpreting the various allusions that the genre contains is highly essential to the over-all literary and semantic understanding of the genre. The findings also clearly revealed the nature of the historical, geographical, religions and sociological background of the Ise, Ado, Ikole and Itaji people in the Ekiti kingdoms. |xiv, 198|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Specifically, the study was designed to identify the women farmers' role in the production of selected crops and livestock; ascertain the present level of women farmers' knowledge and skill in the selected crops and livestock production, and identify the women farmers training needs in relation to their roles in selected crops and livestock production. The study was conducted in five selected Local Government Areas (LGAs) out of the 25 LGAs in Oyo state. Two percent of the communities in each selected LGA were randomly selected and one tenth of the households in each of the selected communities were also random1y selected. Structured interview schedule was developed and used to collect information from one hundred and seventy one women farmers. Descriptive statistical techniques like frequency counts, percentage, mean, standard deviation and weighted mean scores were used to analyse the data. In addition, correlation and regression analyses were used to determine the relationships between the independent and dependent variables investigated in the study.  The results showed that women farmers performed virtually all farm operations. Although they were highly involved in selection of cassava planting materials, planting of seeds, harvesting of grains and vegetables, they were less involved in chemical weeding, construction of poultry and livestock houses, slaughtering and dressing of animals and marketing of livestock products. The weighted mean scores in knowledge and skill of women farmers were low in chemical treatment of seeds, chemical weeding, storage of grains in modern maize cribs and silos, chemical and indigenous method of pest control and marketing of produce at cooperatives. The construction of modern houses for poultry, and pens for livestocks, compounding of livestock feeds, livestock breeding, identification and diagnosis of sick animals, selection and administration of drugs also had low weighted mean scores on knowledge and skill. The felt training needs of women farmers included construction of modern poultry house, livestock pen, diagnosis of sickness in, livestock and selection and administration of drugs. The study showed positive and significant correlation between felt training income from farming (r = 0.1569). However, there was a negative but significant correlation between felt training needs and years of farming experience (r = -0.1667). |Theses Collection|Crops/Livestock/Women Farmers/Chemical Treatment/Diagnosis/Sick Animals.*||||||Ajetomobi, Joshua Olusegun|M|Factors Affecting the Economic Efficiency of Womewn Farmers Within Ondo State Agricultural Development Programme||||||M.Sc.

Structured questionnaires were administered on the respondents to collect data on salient variables of interest. The analysis of the data revealed some structural differences between participants and non-participants in their use of production resource for maize and cassava but not maize, though both groups were not economically efficient. Results indicate increasing returns, to scale for maize production with sum of elasticities being 1.04 and 1.13 for participants and non-participants respectively. For cassava, results indicate decreasing returns to scale for non-participants with sum of elasticities being 0.71 and 1,13 for participants and non-participants. These result also imply that the participants were more efficient than the non-participants in their use of resources for cassava production.The t-test and X2 test analysis of the socio-economic character of the participants and non-participants showed that age, family size, farming experience and membership of farmers group influenced the respondents willingness to participate in the Women in Agriculture (WIA) programme. It was also observed that the use of fertilizer by participants was significantly affected by their farming experience, record keeping and time devoted to farming. However, only the time devoted to farming significantly affected the use of fertilizer by non-participants. Age and education significantly affected the participants use of credit while the use of credit by non-participant was affected only by farming experience.  Kendalls coefficient of concordance analysis of production constrains showed that the most critical problem of the participants was a shortage of hired labour while that of non-participants was storage.|Theses Collection|Econmic Efficiency/Women Farmers/Structural Differences/Increasing Returns/Kendall's Coefficient*||||||Agbedahunsi, Joseph Moronfolu|M|Investigation into the Antimalarial Constituents of Khaya Grandifoliola [(Welw) C.D.C.

The research was aimed at investigating the antimalarial efficacy of the stem bark extracts and to evaluate the various phytochemical fractions of the extract for antimalarial properties. Also, to isolate and characterize the constituents of the crude drug extract and evaluate these chemical constituents for in vivo (in mice) and in vitro antimalarial properties. In line with these objectives the powdered stem-bark of K. grandifoliola was extracted with water using Soxh1et apparatus. The aqueous extract was successively partitioned with n-hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate. The aqueous extract and the organic solvent fractions were evaluated for schizonticidal (in vivo) and plasmocidal (in vitro) activities against Plasmodium berghei berghei in mice and P. falciparum respectively.The aqueous extract gave about 87% average chemosuppression at 500 mg/kg/day, while the reference chloroquine gave 91 % chemosuppression at 5 mg/kg/day. The n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and water fractions gave 91 %, 45%, 48% and 60% chemosuppression respectively at 200 mg/kg/day. The n-hexane fraction (NH) was further purified and the subfractions therefrom NH-1, NH-2, and NH-3 at 100 mg/kg/day gave 57% and 12% chemosuppression respectively. By in vitro experiment, using P. falciparum, extract and fractions gave 1.C50 value range of 0.84 to 20.41 g/ml for the Nigerian P. falciparum isolates and 1.40 to 21.11 g/ml for the multi-drug resistant clone W2 strain of P. falciparum. Chloroquine and Mefloquine were used as standards which gave 1.C50 values of 0.045 g/ml and 0.002 g/ml, respectively. The NH-2 subfraction gave the highest plasmocidal activity in vitro against P. falciparum (1.44 g/ml for the multi-drug resistant clone W2 strain). Two compounds isolated from the NH-2 subfraction, were characterized as pseudrelone X (NH22e) and methyl 6-acetoxy angolensate (NH23b). Compound C5-IV, obtained from the chloroform fraction, was characterized as methyl-6-hydroxy angolensate while compound KE34-F from the ethyl acetate fraction was suggested to be an isomer of methyl 6-hydroxy angolensate (compound C5-1V). The results have thus provided some scientific support for the use of Khaya grandifoliola as an antimalarial agent by traditional healers in Nigeria. Although the observed activity was lower than that of the standard antimalarial drugs tested, the high level of schizonticidal and plasmocidal activities against multi-drug resistant strain of P. falciparum is interesting and should justify further studies. |Theses Collection|Khaya grandifoliola (Welw) C.D.C. family/Meliaceae/decoction/traditional healers/treatment of  malaria/febrile conditions/antimalaria efficacy/phytochemical fractions/crude drug extract/stem bark/multi-drug resistant*||||||Afolayan, Kayode Raphael|M|Physicochemical properties of lysozome from fruit bat ( Eidolon helvum, kerr) kidney||||||M.Sc, Biochemistry|Ogunbiyi, O.A||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Biochemistry|1995|||OAU|||||x, 79p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The enzyme has been extracted, purified  and characterized from various sources including avian egg-white, insects, reptiles, man, monkey and dog. This study was undertaken to extract and purify the lysozyme from the kidney of the fruit-eating bat, Eidolon helvum (Kerr), with a view to establishing its general and special characteristics in comparison to the liver lysozymes of the same animal and lysozymes from other mammalian as well as non-mammalian sources. A homogenate of fruit bat kidney was prepared and lysozyme purified from it by heat treatment at 60C for 10 minutes followed by cation exchange chromatography and re-chromatography on Carboxymethyl Sephadex C-2S. A partial purification was achieved as the preparation gave two bands on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the enzyme determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 was 13,490 daltons. The enzyme has an optimum pH of between 8.0 and 9.0. Histidine and imidazole inhibit the enzyme competitively with inhibition constants of 20 and 24mM respectively. Substrate saturation of the enzyme occurs in the range 200 to 210g/ml, while substrate inhibition occurs at a substrate concentration above 210g/ml. The Vmax for the enzyme was found to be 13.5 absorbance (450nm) change/g protein while a K of 57.3g/ml was also obtained. The enzyme preparation was relatively stable to heat, retaining about 51% of its activity when incubated for 45 minutes at 60oC and pH 7.0. When heated at 100oC for 20 minutes at a pH value of 5.0, 7.0 or 9.0, the enzyme retained 36.5-43.5% of its activity. Fruit bat kidney lysozyme resembles fruit bat liver lysozyme and hen egg-white lysozyme in many of the properties studied and may be another chicken or c type lysozyme. |Theses collection|enzyme/bacteria/kidney/fruit-eating bat/mammalian/egg-white lysozyme/hen.*||||||Ogunyomi, George Olushola Ayobami|M|`The scale of justice and the judicial process in nigeria||||||PhD,  Law|Ijalaye, D.A.// Bopari,S.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Law|1995|||OAU|||||xix,365p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Towards these ends, the entire superstructure of our legal system and judicial process are erected and continue to be erected for the main purpose of justice-dispensation and the auxiliary goal of securing public order. There is, however, a constant need to appraise and improve upon the process because of its apparent shortcomings, so as to make it more beneficial, even if the desired social goals cannot be attained absolutely. Ironically, the level of success and efficiency or effectiveness of the machinery of justice can only be determined by realistically evaluating the judicial/legal process on the scale of justice based upon an understanding of the relevant concept of as well as the approaches to the administration of justice in Nigeria. The aims and objectives of this thesis are to explore and critically evaluate the Nigerian juridical construct and judicial process on the scale of justice in order to determine whether justice can result there from despite all the emphasis placed on the process as the last hope of man. The work defines our scale of justice as consisting of those beliefs, principles, processes and the institutions which we build up as well as our actions and reaction to them. It reviews and examines theories of justice such as absolute justice, discusses and identifies jurisprudential and sociol-political backgrounds of the Nigerian of Justice and isolates the peculiar or features of law in the solution of human conflicts in Nigeria. In addition, the work also examines and discusses administration of Justice under the modern Nigerian machinery of in the light of public reactions thereto as well as the impact of military administration thereon. The methodology of the analytical and sociological of jurisprudence are employed. Primary and secondary sources, data and literatures are re- viewed and analyzed in the subject of this work. In addition, use is made of practical observation made, and derived in the course of my legal practice. The work finds, on the One hand, that some of the merits of our present day machinery of justice are fair hearing in dispute resolution as well as the proscription of the barbaric modes o right assertion legal process. On the other hand, it that judicial justice, not, only lies beyond the reach of the common man but that the end-product the judicial process could often be unrewarding and illusory if the cost is properly counted. The work maintains that true or real justice cannot be attained through the instrumentality of the judicial process whether in this country or elsewhere because of the many limitations and short-comings of the system which often makes the pursuit of justice practically illusory. Nevertheless, the work, out of expediency, advocates that attention be paid to the serious defects of our adjudicatory system and offers suggestions for its improvement. |Theses collection|Constitution/government and welfare/national unity/legal system/judicial process/jurisprudential/jurisprudence/barbaric modes/sociol-political backgrounds.*||||||Elubamipe, Yunusa Kehinde|F|Towards a marxist epistemology||||||PhD, Philosophy|Fashina, O||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Philosophy|1995|||OAU|||||xii,281p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The thesis examined some major philosophical challenges to traditional foundationalist epistemology by some influential contemporary non-Marxist philosophers such as Wittgenstein, Foucault, Macintyre, Quine, and Rorty. Furthermore, the thesis identified and assessed some influential interpretations and criticisms of epistemology in Marx's philosophical writings. Finally, the thesis attempted to determine in what ways Marxism could make a distinct contribution to epistemology. The methodology employed was textual interpretation and conceptual analysis of existing texts both in Marxist and non-Marxist philosophy. The thesis analyzed primary texts such as Karl Marx's The German Ideology, Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, Grundrisse. The Poverty of Philosophy, Preface to a Critique of Political Economy, and Capital. In addition, up-to-date primary and secondary texts from Marxist and non-Marxist scholars were extensively used. These included journals, monographs, and edited collections. The thesis found that Marx did not offer a systematic epistemology. Nevertheless, Marx made substantive contributions to epistemology, both through his general conception of epistemology and his answers to specific issues in the discipline. In particular, it was found that there are Marxist answers to the problems of Truth, Perception, Knowledge, and justification. Although Marxist epistemology as it was identified in this thesis did not present a settled core set of answers to these traditional issues, this does not detract from Marx's contributions. The thesis concluded that a viable and intellectually rewarding Marxist epistemology will emerge from the development and expansion of the current state of Marxist philosophical scholarship, through constant revisions and rigorous critical appraisal. |Theses collection|Marxist epistemology/non-Marxist epistemology/philosophers/foundationalist/philosophical.*||||||Brown, Adedayo Alfred|M|Evalation of peppers (capsicum spp) as enhances of egg production and quality in layers||||||PhD, Animal Science|Sonaiya, E.B.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Animal Science|1995|||OAU|||||xiv, 116p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

This research was carried out to study the chemical composition of local peppers (Capsicum spp.), and to determine the extent to which inclusion of various levels of peppers in layers diets could affect productive performance and quality of eggs. Four varieties of peppers were tested: Capsicum annuum ('Tatase'-TT), Capsicum annuum ('Atarodo'-RD), Capsicum frutescens ('Shombo'-SH), Capsicum frutescens ('Atawewe'- WW). Proximate components, total carotenoids, ascorbic acid, pH and crude piperine were determined in pepper varieties subjected to two processing procedures: Parboiling-Drying-Grinding; or Drying-Grinding. Voluntary intake of peppers and water, and bioavailability of pepper carotenoids were determined in layers. Studies on productive performance for two 28-day periods were carried out using diets containing 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0% of SR, or RD in the diets. Eggs produced by birds feeding on these diets were evaluated for their quality characteristics. All the peppers contained more Gross Energy (GE), Crude Protein (CP), Crude Fibre (CF), Ether Extract (EE) and ash than maize which had more Nitrogen - Free Extract (NFE). Among the peppers, WW consistently contained the highest CF, EE and GE; TT was highest in CP, ash and NFE; SH and RD were marginal in their CF, CP, EE, GE, ash and NFE contents. Parboiling prior to drying and grinding led to a general reduction in the vitamin C, total carotenoid, CP, EE, GE, CF and OM contents of the peppers.Voluntary intake of peppers and water was in the order: RD = SH = WW = TT (P<0.05). The percent bioavailability of the carotenoids was not significantly (P>0.05) different among the various peppers. Body weights and rectal temperatures were not significantly affected by pepper intake, 'and no mortality was recorded. Vitamin C content of the peppers was positively correlated (P<0.05) with pepper and water intake (r=0.73 and r=O.90, respectively). Bioavailability of carotenoids was negatively correlated (P<0.05) with total carotenoid content of peppers (r=- 0.71). There were no significant differences (P>0.05) among the various diets for hen-day production, mean egg weight, rate of lay, egg mass and feed consumed/g egg at the end of the 56-day study. Egg weights and feed intake were significantly higher in the second period (P<0.05). The 2.0% RD diet had the highest (P>O.O5) egg weights, yolk weight, yolk color, and shell surface area among the ~ annuum diets. Overall, the 2.0% RD diet was not different from the 0.5% SH for most of the parameters measured (P>O.O5). There was a significant correlation (P<O.Ol) between the yolk weight and egg weight for the Capsicum - containing diets. The study shows that Atarodo (C. annuum) or Shombo (C. frutescens) did not significantly enhance productive performance, while 1.5-2.0% Atarodo (C. annuum), or 0.5% Shombo (C. frutescens) could enhance yolk pigmentation, yolk weight, shell thickness, and egg weight in layers. The ascorbic acid and carotenoid contents of peppers may be the major active compounds responsible for enhancement of quality of the eggs. |Theses collection|Peppers/yolks/eggs/Parboiling-Drying-Grinding/Drying-Grinding/yolk pigmentation.*||||||Bodunrin, Henry Olatokunbo|M|Attitude of adolescent towards abortion in Lagos Mainland Local Government Area||||||M.Sc, Sociology and Anthropology|Odebiyi, A.I||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Sociology and Anthropology|1995|||OAU|||||ix, 86p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Pre-marital sex is now the norm among adolescents hence unwanted pregnancies are on the increase. Against this background, unsafe abortions often resulting in mortality among adolescents is often rampant or unavoidable. This explains the need for a study of this nature so as to prevent this human wastage. This study examined the attitude of adolescents towards the issue of abortion and towards its legalization. It examined adolescents preferences for safe sex, and also identified the methods of abortion known to adolescents. Finally, the study highlighted the need for education on safe sex. The study was carried out among secondary school pupils in Lagos State between mid May and June ending 1994, using a multi-stage sampling technique, 240 secondary school pupils were selected from senior secondary school III within Lagos Mainland Local Government Area. Primary data were collected through questionnaires while the review of previous studies formed secondary data. The data collected were tabulated, interpreted and buttressed with discussions. Furthermore Chi-square analysis was adopted for testing the hypotheses. The most interesting aspect of the finding is that there were differences between the male and female responses. More female adolescents preferred abortion to marriage as a solution for unwanted pregnancy than the male adolescents. Again more females than males stated that they would depend more on peers than parents on issues of abortion. Adolescents in the study were not favourably disposed towards the use of condoms. Moreover, adolescents tend to support the introduction of sex education in secondary schools. Some of the recommendations that emanated from the study are that government should legalize abortion and guarantee all women access to contraceptive choices and safe abortions. Also obstetric wards should be supplied with adequate facilities for effective management of complicated abortion cases. Sex education should be introduced into secondary schools and adolescents should be encouraged to practise safe sex through the use of condoms. Moreover, parents should counsel their adolescent children on issues of sexuality and contraceptives so as to prevent unwanted pregnancies. |Theses collection|Adolescent sexuality/abortion/Pre-marital sex/adolescents/unwanted pregnancies/human wastage/safe sex/marriage/condoms/contraceptive/obstetric ward/children.*||||||Adedui, Aderemi |M|Sediment yield from erosion plot on ultisols, ife area, south western nigeria||||||M.Sc, Geography|Ogunkoya, O.O||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Geography|1995|||OAU|||||ix, 85p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

These nine plots are sited in three different locations around Tonkere on slopes of 10%, 8% and 14%, with three contiguous plots (A, B, C) in each of the locations.The study aims at determining the magnitude of soil loss from the maize plots; the relationship between soil loss and factors such as rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope and crop management and using the data obtained to evaluate the parameters of Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) as well as to test the goodness of fit of the USLE derived for the study area.Rainfall erosivity parameters and other components of USLE were determined and analysed following the methods outlined by Morgan (1979). Multivariate statistical methods were used in data analysis.Soil loss was highest in Tonkore 3 (309 Kg/ha/yr), followed closely by Tonkero 1 (219 Kg/ha/yr) and the least (73Kg/ha/yr) from Tonkere 2. Soil loss correlated most significantly with runoff, followed closely by rainfall amount and antecedent precipitation index (A.P.I.) with r = 0.69, 0.58 and 0.57 respectively (significant at a = 0.05).Other erosivity parameters such as peak intensity, Al15, El15, KE>25 and El30 indices were also significantly related to soil loss but average rainfall intensity did not.Runoff, rainfall amount, A.P.I; peak intensity, EI15, KE>25, EI3O indices and average intensity respectively explain about 48%, 34%, 32%, 18%, 14%, 13%, 10%, 8% and 1% of the soil loss variance.Of all the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) components considered in the present study, rainfall erosivity factor (R) correlate most significantly with the observed soil loss (r= 0.88, at a = 0.05) followed closely byslope factor (LS). However, crop/cover factor (C), credibility factor (K) and management practice (P) exhibited poor or no relationships with soil loss, Rainfall erosivity and slope factor together account for 89% of the variance in the soil loss observed with the former alone accounting for 78% of the soil loss variance in the nine stations. The stepwise regression equation derived from the result of the USLE components determined from nine stations is expressed asLog A = -0.0054 + 0.68 Log R + 0.28 Log LS.The result of the X2 - analysis used to test the goodness of fit of the derived USLE for the study area revealed that the difference between predicted soil loss and observed soil loss is not significant.|Theses collection|Sediment yield/early maize/Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE)/Rainfall erosivity.*||||||Adebisi, Samuel Sunday|M|Teratogenic of ethanol on the inta-uterine development of bones in rat||||||M.Sc.

Its hepatic biotransformation, however, allows only a small fraction of the orally administered drug to reach the systemic circulation unchanged. The alternative route via slow rate-controlled infusion is difficult for ambulatory patients. The current effort is directed towards the formulation of a suppository of amodiaquine hydrochloride (AMQHCL), since it has been shown that rectally absorbed drugs bypass the liver to enter the systemic circulation.The in vitro release of AMQHC1 from naturally occurring and locally available fatty bases such as theobroma oil and shea butter has been reported to be poor when compared to the semi-synthetic fatty bases and the hydrophilic bases, In the present study, non-ionic surfactants were therefore incorporated in the suppositories and their effects at enhancing in vitro release of AMQHC1 determined. The amount of drug release from the prepared suppositories in the in vitro test for drug release was estimated spectrophotometrically. The effects of the types and concentrations of surfactants on the extent of drug release, melting range and softening point were assessed by complete analysis of variance and the Newman-Keul's test.Tween 80 at 4% w/w produced the best release enhancement from theobroma oil suppositories. Tween 20 was optimal at 8% w/w while Brij 35 inhibited drug release. All the surfactants enhanced AMQHCL release from shea butter suppositories. The melting ranges of all the suppositories of the two bases were adequate and there was correlation between softening point and  the extent of drug release. From the kinetics studies on theobroma oil and shea butter suppositories, the zero-order kinetics was found to be the best fitting model. However, at 10% w/w AMQHCL in shea butter suppositories, diffusion controlled release was observed which changed to zero-order kinetics at 20% w/w AMQHCL.The best formulation of AMQHCL suppositories with adequate drug release and physico-chemical properties can be produced with 4% w/w Tween 80 in theobroma oil and shea butter. Softening point may serve as an index of drug release and the zero-order kinetics will be very beneficial if sustained in vivo. This will provide a constant drug blood-level that will be independent of the drug concentration at the site of absorption.|Theses collection|Amodiaquine/chloroquine/Plasmodium falciparum malaria/ambulatory patients/theobroma oil/shea butter/drug blood-level /biotransformation/drug.*||||||Adebayo, Adetokunbo Adedayo|M|Electrical resistivity investigation of the ground water potential of the okitipupa/ agbabu tar sand area of ondo state||||||M.Sc.

This is with a view to identifying the different aquifer units and their characteristics, the subsurface structures/tectonics and their influence on the general hydrogeological conditions in the area. The electrical resistivity data were made up of 48 Schlumberger Vertical Electrical Soundings (VES). The resulting VES curves were interpreted by curve matching and computer based direct and indirect interpretation techniques.The results revealed that simple type curves (e.g. H, HA, KH,QH types) are characteristic of the areas where the depth to the Basement Complex rock is shallow, while complex type curves (e.g. KHK,KHAK,HKHK and QHKQ types) are indicative of the areas where the depth to the Basemcnt Complex rocks are rather deep. From the quantitative interpretation of the sounding curves and available geological data, a maximum of fOur geoelectrical layers were identified North of the area close to the Basement Complex while further South, between five and six geoelectrical layers were identified. These layers include the topsoil/lateritic horizons (l= 200-3840?-m), sandy clay/clay (l= 10-500?-m), saturated sand/conglomerate (l= 300-900?-m) and weathered basement/fresh bedrock (l>1300?-m). The results also revealed evidence of faulting by the uneven nature of the basement topography, downwarping and rock boundary displacement. Dar Zarrouk parameters (T = Transverse unit resistance, in Ohm-m2 and S = Longitudinal layer conductance in Siemens) were computed from surface measured resistivity values; and from therein aquifer transmissivity estimated. A good relationship exists between the transmissivity values calculated from pumping test analysis and those computed from VES results. In the Abeokuta Formation, transmissivity from pumping test analysis was 10368 m2/day while the transmissivity calcu1ated from VES results were found to range from 10164 m2/day} to l0500m2/day. In the Benin Formation, the transmissivity from pumping test analysis was between 103.68 m2/day and 146.88 m2/day for OK BH 3 respectively; Whi1e the transmissivity calculated from VES results ranges between 101.38 rn2/day to 152.00m2 /day respectively. The Abeokuta aquifer seems more pro1ific than the Benin Formation aquifer.The most promising aquifer unit with resistivity values of between 200-900?-m in the study area was found, to consist of fine-sands to coarse grained sand-stones and conglomerate which are at depths of about 50m to the North and about 95m to the South respectively. The resistivity values of the tar sand/clayey horizons and saturated alluvium were found to be quite low (l = 10-100?-m).

The results permitted fair to excellent correlation between the geoelectrical and stratigraphic data, particularly the delineation of lithological boundaries, bitumen saturation.

The application of a microprocessor for hazard detection and control will be of great benefit to an industrial environment from the point of flexibility, reliability, versatility and cost reduction.In this research the software aspects of a microprocessor-based hazard detector device was designed. The hazards monitored include: fire, flooding, unauthorized entry and burglary. Various sensors were used to monitor and detect these hazards. Specifically, smoke detector for fire outbreak, liquid level switch for flooding, a combination of switches and clock for unauthorized entry and finally a combination switches, clock and crystal microphone to sense burglary. To drive the hardware, a suite of flexible softwares utilizing the Round-Robin polling technique over interrupt technique was designed and implemented using assembly language. Simulation of the design was implemented using the microprocessor application trainer (MAT 385).The performance evaluation of the designed software simulation gave independent acquisition of each sensor input signal for each hazard. The processor ends an average of 2 to 3secs processing each sensor input signal and activating the respective actuators to forestall the part icular hazard. The software designed eliminates the use of multiple circuits, to detect, monitor and control the various hazards. It also offers flexibility such that if the environment changes, the only change needed will be reprogramming of the ROM. |Theses collection|Human resources/hazards/industrial environment/microprocessor/flooding/software/programming/ROM/microprocessor application trainer (MAT 385)/sense burglary/crystal microphone/liquid level switch/sensor .*||||||Abayomi, Olatokunbo Solomon|M|The biology of the fish genius claria in opa reservoir, obafemi awolowo university, ile-ife, nigeria||||||Ph.D. Zoology|Arawomo, G.A.O.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Zoology|1995|||OAU|||||xx, 142p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The longline was the best gear for the exploitation of this fish species in the reservoir.A total number of 1253 fish specimens identified as Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822) were caught as the only fish species of the genus Clarias in the reservoir. More of the fish specimens were caught during the dry seasons than the wet season. They were mostly caught at might and the specimens were not evenly distributed in the reservoir. The majority of C. gariepinus caught were concentrated at the shallow vegetated inshore area.The study revealed that C. gariepinus was an omnivore. The food items were plant detritus, whole insects and insects remains, mud, diatoms, algae, rotifers, molluscs, crustaceans, fish, protozoans, earthworm, plant seeds and palm fruits. Detritus and diatoms were predominant during the rainy season. The food consumed by the fish varied with sizes. It fed throughout day and night.The sex ratio of C. gariepinus in Opa reservoir was 2:1 (male to female). The fish species bred throughout the year during the period of study. The peak of breeding was observed in the months of June to August. The fecundity of C. gariepinus in Opa reservoir ranged between 1,567 and 650,625 eggs with a mean of 57.81 eggs. The eggs had bimodal distribution with modes at 0.4mm  1.0mm  1.8mm.The fish vertebrae were found to be most suitable to age C. gariepinus. The annular rings were laid on the vertebrae between December and February when there was a temperature drop due to the harmattan period followed by high temperatures of the dry season. The females grew faster in length than the males in the first two years while the males grew more rapidly than the females in the successive years of life. The growth in length in both sexes of C. gariepinus decreased as the fish aged. The weight of the fish species in both sexes increased with age.C. gariepinus thrived well in Opa reservoir an the mean condition factor for the fish species was 0.72. C. gariepinus was found to be infected by only one parasite which was a trematode, Orientocreadium sp. It was concentrated only in the adult and more were found in the male specimens. The level of parasitic infection was observed to be very low and therefore never affected the vitality of the fish species.|Theses collection|Fecundity/gill netting/hook and line fishing/Clarias gariepinus/vertebrae.*||||||Adeyemi, Adenike|F|Haemagglutinins from the seeds of Dioclea reflexa (Hook,F) (Papilionacae)||||||Ph.D. Biochemistry|Aboderin, A.//Ogunbiyi, O.A.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Biochemistry|1995|||OAU|||||xvi, 141p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The extract however showed no lectin-carbohydrate interaction in double-diffusion experiments in agarose gels with starch, guargum, glycogen, Dextran T-500 and hemocyanin.DRA-I is a monomeric protein, Mw 34000 daltons which is inhibited by N-Acetyl-glucosamine. DRA-II on the other hand, is a homomeric dieter with Mw (subunit) of 16000 daltons. It is inhibited by D-glucose and D-mannose and their a-methyl derivatives. DRA-I and DRA-II are not glycoproteins. The amino acid compositions of DRA-I and DRA-II, although different, may be compared with those of many other legume lectins documented in the literature. DRA-I is clearly a larger molecule with 343 residues as against 153 for DRA-II. DRA-I lacks methionine residue and is completely devoid of sulphur-containing amino acids while DRA-II has a single methionine residue per subunit.The data so far established suggest that DRA-I and DRA-II are different molecular entities from the same source considering their physical and biological properties. They however share many characteristics with other documented agglutinins.The two agglutinins are probably products of two separate genetic determinants although the possibility that both are products of a large precursor molecule cannot be definitely excluded.|Theses collection|lectins/plant species/haemagglutinating activity/electrophoresis/monomeric protein/glycoproteins.*||||||Adekomi, Ademola Abimbola|M|Effect of peer interactive video taped microteaching on performance in teaching pratice among teachers tainees in selected subjects of the adeyemi college of education in ondo||||||PhD.

A total of sixty randomly selected first year NCE students were used for the Study. Twenty students, each from Physics, Yoruba, and Geography respectively were chosen to represent the broad areas of pure science, arts, and social sciences. Data were collected using the five instruments named Practical Teaching Assessment Scale (PTAS), Rater's Perception Inventory (RPI), Modified Interaction Scale (MIS), Teacher Competency Pre-knowledge Test (TCPT), and Teacher Trainee Evaluation of Microteaching (TEM). The data collected were analyzed using mean score, correlation coefficients, t-test, Wilcoxon test of gain and E-ratio at the relevant stages.The analysis of data revealed that every teacher-trainee involved in the microteaching exercise performed significantly better in the field teaching practice than their control counterparts. In essence, the mean score (X) of the field teaching groups are 63%, 62%, and 68% compared with the control groups' mean score of 44%, 50% and 48% respectively in Physics, Yoruba, and Geography. There was also a significantly higher and non-uniform interaction in rnicroteaching than in field teaching for the three subject groups. The study further revealed that Raters perception of microteaching has no significant effect on Rater's assessment of teaching practice. The correlation coefficients between Rater's perception and their ratings of either microteaching or field teaching are low and non significant, ranging between 0.007 and 0.07. There was also no significant difference between the performance of male and female teacher-trainees in either micro-teaching or field teaching.Further more, the study revealed that microteaching was effective for training both male and female teachers in all the subject areas investigated. It was also found that there is a positive correlation between performances in field teaching and microteaching; hence microteaching has a high degree of predictive validity for field teaching. The use of interaction ana1ysis for evaluating teaching practice was found more probing and more objective than the conventional Practical Teaching Assessment Scale (PTAS). |Theses collection|Peer Interactive Videotaped Microteaching/field teaching practice/teacher-trainees/Practical Teaching Assessment Scale (PTAS)/Rater's Perception Inventory (RPI)/Modified Interaction Scale (MIS)/Teacher Competency Pre-knowledge Test (TCPT)/Teacher Trainee Evaluation of Microteaching (TEM)/microteaching.*||||||Aboderin, Oluwakemi Adebisi|F|Ona iseda gbolohun ibeere ninu ede yoruba||||||M.Sc.

Government and Binding theory explained sentence structures through some constraints, conditions and rules. It also explained reasons for movement in Yoruba wh-question sentences. X-bar theory, which is a tool of Government and Binding, was used to explain constituents' precedence and dominance, antecedent government, C -command and M-command. Government and Binding theory was used to explain the empty Category Principle, Surface Structure constraint, bounding and subjacency as they affect  Yoruba question sentences. It is  expected that the extent of the applicability of Government and  Binding theory onYoruba wh-questions will be exposed by this work. The bases of this work were relevant books on this theory, sentences extracted from native speakers' speeches and the researcher's competence too helped a great deal  especially to explain movements and their grammaticality  or deviances. This work showed that as there are various wh-questions, so are there various types of movement. It also showed that many of the constraints, conditions and rules evident in Government and Binding theory were useful for the explanation of Yoruba wh-question though there are some exceptions. The effectiveness of government and binding theory is not debatable but its universality needs to be revisited. Government and Binding theory could also be a basis for the explanation of sentence structures in the Language. |ix,135p|||||||Yoruba||Obafemi Awolowo University, H. O. Library, Ile-Ife, Osun State.

The gross TSP concentration ranged from 139 g/m3 to 9368 g/m3 with an average of 3000 g/m3 for dry season within the factory. In wet season, the range was from 159 to 2304 g/m3 with an average of 750 g/m3. The range of TSP concentration in the neighbourhoods for both dry and wet seasons are 164 - 1720 g/m3 and 100 - 325 g/m3 respectively. In major shopfloors such as cement mill, raw mill and packing plant, dust concentration as high as 3 x 104 g/m3 was recorded. Similar trend was observed in the deposition rates within the factory. High deposition rate was recorded at the site close to the process area. The deposition rate within the factory ranged from 187 - 1681 Tonnes/km2.month, with maximum deposition rate observed in wet season. In the neighbourhoods, dust deposition range is from 6 to 266 Tonnes/km2.month. Comparing dust concentrations within the factory premises and even in the neighbourhoods with limit set by FEPA for industrial environment (250 g/m3 daily average), values observed exceeded the limit by 3 times to about an order of magnitude in most cases. The deposition rates exceeded the USEPA limit of 11.8 Tonnes/km2. month by about two orders of magnitude. Elemental characterization of both samples was done by Energy dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) technique. The analysis revealed the presence of the following elements in most of the samples: Na, AI, Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, ln, S, Cu, and Pb. Enrichment factors calculated for these elements showed Ca, S, ln, Cu, and Pb to be highly enriched. Range of enrichment factor values obtained for these elements are: 30 - 350, 75 - 200, 100 - 14700 and 20 - 700 (dimensionless) respectively. The implication is that the activities of the factory enhanced the presence of these elements in the ambient air. AI, Fe, Mn, Na, V, and Cr were moderately enriched while Si and K were not enriched compared to the crustal source. Source apportionment by Factor analysis (FA) and Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) receptor models were carried out. Cement and soil mainly in the form of re-entrained dust were identified as the major sources of these pollutants. The methods revealed 60 - 82 % cement contribution within the factory while 10 - 30 % were attributed to cement in the neighbourhoods. The dispersion characteristic of the factory using Gaussian based dispersion model showed the predicted TSP concentrations to peak at 18145 g/m3 and 11100 g/m3 for 8-hours and 24-hours averaging periods respectively. These values agree with observed concentrations within a factor of two. From isopleth plot of the model run, the TSP concentrations and Atmospheric deposition rates, sanitary zone of between 5 km or greater has been found to be an ideal safe distance from the factory because the TSP concentrations predicted by the model and measured values were below the FEPA limits. In order to assess the possible health impact of cement dust on the workers, 327 randomly selected workers were subjected to lung function test. The Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEVJ and the Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) of the lungs of the workers were measured using Vitalograph bellows Spirometer. Hence, the average ratio of FEV1/FVC for the selected workers was 81.1 % compared with 84 % for the control (120 healthy non-industrially exposed population). This study has revealed that cement workers have relatively lower lung function when compared to non-exposed controls. This could lead to chronic obstructive lung disease later in life. Toxicity potential (TP) which shows the degree of contamination of the environment by pollutants was determined. The TP value greater than 1 could be regarded as dangerous to man's health. A highest TP of 34.2 was obtained in the shopfloors with 1.9 recorded in the neighbourhoods. This study has shown the need to control environmental pollutants emanating from this factory both for compliance with limits by FEPA and the health of the communities purposes. Also, the adequacy of EDXRF technique in the analysis of particulate pollutants has been corroborated by this study. |Theses collection|total suspended particulate matter (TSP)/atmospheric dust deposition rates (Tonnes/km2. .month)/shopfloors/Chemical Mass Balance (CMB)/Forced Expiratory Volume/pollutants.*||||||Nwankpa, Alexander Chinyere|F|Determination of elemental composition of nigerian coals by fast neutron activation analysis||||||M.Sc.

Neutron flux at the centre of the vial in the irradiation position of the neutron generator has been measured to be (2.610.04) x 108 ncm2s-1 and the spatial distribution established.Thirty four elements were detected and their concentrations determined using the high purity Germanium detector. Essential corrections due to interfering reactions associated with each nuclear reaction were made.The Rare Earth Elements REE, La, Ce, Sm and Eu were found to be common in Nigerian coals. The concentrations of the major/minor elements determined for the Nigerian coals were found to be much tower than the mean values of those reported for coal samples from other parts of the world. Also the concentrations of the toxic elements As, Cr, Cu and Sb in Nigerian coals are very low compared with China and U.S.A. coals. Good agreement was observed within one standard deviation when the results were compared with the work of others that used the INAA method in analyzing Nigerian coals.

It was also designed to determine whether the level of test anxiety, sex and religious beliefs of subjects would influence the relative efficacy of BRT in reducing test anxiety. The study made use of random pre-test, post-test control group design. The forty eight subjects were drawn from 124 senior secondary two students of Anglican commercial Grammar School, Osogbo who completed Test Anxiety Scale (TAS). Through stratified random sampling, the subjects were categorised into control and experimental groups. Both TAS and General Anxiety Scale (GAS) (Sarason, 1972), were used in determining the pre-treatment test anxiety level of subjects. The treatment package was adapted from Goldrieds blueprint on cognitive restructuring therapy which consisted of 8 sessions of 40 minutes each, spanning four weeks. Both TAS and GAS were readministered for post test. T-test analysis and analysis of variances (ANOVA) were used in data analysis.Results of statistical analysis revealed that test anxiety of secondary school students could be significantly reduced by BRT (P <0.05). However, it was moderately test-anxious subjects whose test anxiety were most considerably reduced (P<0.05). It was further established that there was no differential effect of BRT on subjects' sex, academic class and religious beliefs. The therapy could thus be applied irrespective of sex, academia class and religious beliefs of the subjects. The study therefore showed that BRT could effectively reduce the test anxiety of subjects and that its efficacy was not impaired by subjects' sex, academic class and religious beliefs. |Theses collection|Behaviour Rehearsal Therapy (BRT)/Test Anxiety Scale (TAS)/General Anxiety Scale (GAS)/religious beliefs.*||||||Salami, Ayobami T.|M|Structural changes in vegetal cover in ife and ede regions of south western nigeria between 1963 and 1993||||||Ph.D. Geography|Ekanade, O.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Geography|1995|||OAU|||||xix, 186p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Emphasis was placed on the identification of structural changes of the vegetation although, some baseline data on the floristic characterisation of the area were also generated from the study. For comparative purpose, two study sites were chosen - one from the forest reserve area, which is closer to the mature forest, and one in Ede area which is close to the forest fringe. Data were also collected from a tract of mature Tropical Rain Forest to serve as control for the study sites. Data were generated from aerial photographs (1963 and 1973), SPOT XS (1986), LANDSAT TM (1991) and intensive fieldwork (1993). The satellite imageries were digitally analysied using MUL TISCOPE software package while aerial photographs were subjected to analogue procedure. After the barycentric classification, the outputs of cover statistics, confusion matrix and classification were obtained and related to the results of photo interpretation. It was found that agro-forestry is as much a threat to mature Rain Forest in Ife Area as mixed grassland is to secondary forest in Ede Area. In Ede Area, the secondary forest is receding at an average annual rate of 1.90% \vhile mixed grassland is increasing at an average annual rate of 16.11 %. In Ife Area, the areal coverage of forest reserve is reducing at an average annual rate of 1.01% while agro-forestry is increasi,ng at an average annual rate of 16.42%. The introduction of exotic trees as it is currently being practised by the government was found to have aggravated the intensity of floristic degradation in Ife Region while the activities of peasant farmers have resulted in higher degradation of structural complexity of vegetation in Ede Region. The study shows that vegetation structure is the most affected parameter, when mature Tropical Rain Forest is subjected to human interference. For instance, percentage overstorey cover has been degraded by 95.87% and 73.45% in Ede and Ife Regions respectively. The floristic' analysis shows that areas where tree crops are now predominant in Ife Region were once occupied by the typical species of the mature Rain Forest while ecotone communities are found in Ede Region. Furthermore, agricultural practices have led to regressive succession in Ede Region. The digital image analysis shows that precise classification which is easily obtained from the automated procedure in the dev-eloped countries was hampered by the heterogeneous nature of the landscape. However, the level of error associated with each classification was obtained from the analysis. This study highlights the problems and prospects of using remote sensing techniques in surveying Africa's rural landscape with its bewildering complexities. The findings of the study suggest that paucity of data which has been the bane of rural planning and indeed, environmental management in Nigeria, could be easily overcome if the potentialities of aerospace data are fully exploited.|Theses collection|Remote sensing/Vegetation/floristic/forest reserve area/Tropical Rain Forest/environmental management.*||||||Sanni, Ayodele Adedayo|M|Development of a microproceesor based electronic rotary display board||||||M.Sc.

This project presents a novel technique of utilizing a single display,structure to convey, one at a time, numerous large, 'life-sized' aesthetic, attention - catching and impacting picture adverts each conveying different and distinct advertising messages that will lead to the satisfaction of their diverse needs. In this design, microprocessor - controlled stepper motors were employed to effect bidirectional movement of the screen (on which the adverts can either be drawn, pasted or printed). The hardware designed includes transistor driver/buffer circuitries to power and control each individual motor for independent functioning; position detector circuitry comprising of an LED/LDR pair; and a lighting control circuit consisting of four a.c switching reed relays for powering any three combinations out of the total of four different coloured 240V a.c bulbs. A modular - structured software application control program to implement the various sequential control operations of the display system was developed and tested using the software development aids on the Microprocessor Application Trainer MAT 385 which also acts as the controller for the system. The MAT under program control implemented: the powering of one of the motors at a time by generating its respective step drive sequence effecting bidirectional movement of the screen; independent viewing of each of the adverts; setting and execution of the viewing-time of each advert (frame); and the beautification of any viewed advert by appropriately activating the coloured lamps. The average viewing time of the designed display board is 8 secs with an average screen speed of 0.15 cm/secs (each motor being driven at a stepping rate of 200 steps/secs). These values though, can be varied to suite a variety of purposes requiring different viewing times as well as screen speeds. This design has great potentials as a commercial tool because of its versatility and relative cheapness. |Theses collection|Outdoor advertising/microprocessor - controlled stepper motors/Microprocessor Application Trainer MAT 385.*||||||Ugwu, Elizabeth Ndidi|F|The study of terpenoid constituents of euphobia||||||M.Sc.

The latex of Euphorbia tirucalli was collected by tapping the stems of the plant along old lfe-lbadan road, lle-lfe for a period of three days, while the latex of Euphorbia poisonii was collected from Adelu village in Kwara state. The latices were extracted with methylated spirit and the extract partitioned into petroleum spirit and ether fractions. These fractions were then subjected to extensive chromatographic separations, mainly column and a series of multiple preparative thin layer chromatography. The pure compounds isolated were analysed using infra red spectroscopy and proton and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The petroleum spirit extract of Euphorbia tirucalli gave compound ETP20, a triterpenoid. The ether extract afforded pure solids, ETE30B and ETE40C. The ETE30B was found to be identical with Euphorianin, an ingol-hemiacetalacetate diterpenoid ester, while ETE40 was shown to be a phorbol ester. Three pure closely related compounds euphorianin and compound L (which had earlier been isolated) and a new euphorianin derivative compound K were isolated from Euphorbia poisonii.The diterpenoid compounds isolated from these plants could possess some of the biological activities associated with the diterpenoids as has been reported in some other Euphorbia species. These compounds may also be responsible for some of the reported medicinal activities of the plant. |Theses collection|Euphorbiaceae plants/drug/diterpenoid/spectroscopic studies/methylated spirit/chromatography/petroleum spirit.*||||||Popoola, Bayode Isaiah|M|Effect of a self management training model on study behaviour of secondary school students in akure, ondo state||||||M.A. Educaion (Guidance and Counselling)|Adeyoju,J.A.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Educational Foundation and Councelling|1995|||OAU|||||x, 159p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The objectives or the study were to determine the efficacy of a training in self-management of study behaviour and to ascertain whether the sex and academic abilities of subjects would significantly influence its effectiveness. The study sample consisted of forty-eight students  of St Peter's Secondary School, Akure in Ondo State. The subjects were classified into three academic ability groups and assigned to one experimental and one control group. Two instruments, the Study Behaviour Measurement Scale (SBMS) and the Adolescent Self-Control Scale (ASCS) were administered before and after the training programme to collect data on subjects' study behaviour and self-control skills. Data collected from the administration of the research instruments were analysed using the t-test and analysis or variance (ANOVA). The significance of the results were considered at 0.05 level or probability.  The results of the data analyses showed that the self-management training model was an effective intervention technique for improving the study behaviour of students. The results also showed that subjects who were trained in self- management of study behaviour significantly increased their general self-control skills. However, no significant difference was round between the effects of the training programme on the study behaviour of male and female subjects. It was also discovered that while the training made no significant impact on the study behaviour of high academic performers, it was found to be effective with low and average academic performers. The findings of the study suggest the need to or self-management skills into the secondary school curriculum in Nigeria to enhance students' academic performance.|Theses collection|self-management training model/Study Behaviour Measurement Scale (SBMS)/Adolescent Self-Control Scale (ASCS)/*||||||Shittu, Adebayo Osagie|M|Detection and characterization of B-Lactamase in straphylococci isolated from septic wound||||||M.Sc.

The discovery of penicillin and its clinical practice in the 1940s changed the direction of medical practice in which it became possible to cure serious and progressive infections caused by common bacterial pathogens including those due to Staphvlococcus aureus. However, the widespread use of penicillin led to a phenomenon in which patients and hospital personnel had become colonized with penicillin resistant staphvlococcus aureus. This study was conducted to characterize staphylococci obtained from septic wounds and to screen them for the production of penicillinase. The study population consisted of two hundred patients undergoing wound dressing at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, and the Health Centre, both in Ile-Ife. Smears were obtained from the wound site of each patient using sterile cotton-tipped applicators and were cultured on blood, nutrient and mannitol salt agar. Bacterial isolates were identified based on their cultural, morphological and biochemical characteristics. Phage typing of the staphylococcal isolates was performed using the international set of typing phages and the antibiotic sensitivity patterns of these strains, were determined using the agar diffusion method. All the isolates were screened for the production of beta-lactamase enzyme using the acidometric agar plate method and the iodometric method. Ninety-eight staphylococcal isolates were recovered from the two hundred patients with wound sepsis. Eighty of the isolates were staphylococcus aureus, twelve were staphylococcus sciuri and six isolates were staphylococcus qallinarium. Phage typing of the S. aureus strains revealed that group III and non-typable strains were predominant. All the coagulase negative staphylococci were non-typable. Tests of the antibiotic sensitivity patterns revealed that all the S. aureus strains were resistant to penicillin and streptomycin while 89% were resistant to ampicillin. In addition, 26% were resistant to tetracycline, 15% to chloramphenicol, 6% and 9% were resistant to gentamycin and erythromycin. Twenty-two multiple antibiotic resistance forms of S.  aureus were recovered, representing 28% of the isolates. All the coagulase negative staphylococcal isolates were resistant to penicillin and trimethoprim, while 89% were resistant to streptomycin and fusidic acid, 67% resistant to neomycin and kanamycin while 44% were resistant to chloramphenicol. All the S. aureus isolates produced beta-lactamase as detected by the acidometric agar plate method while 94% tested positive using the iodometric agar method. None of the coagulase negative staphylococci produced beta-lactamase detectable by either of these methods. The study revealed S. aureus as the predominant organism associated with septic wounds in the two hospitals and that penicillin G may not be effective in treating wound sepsis. It is suggested that sensitivity tests be done to identify the infective agent before treatment. There is also the need to control the use and sale of antibiotics in our community. |Theses collection|Wound sepsis/physicians/antibiotics/penicillin/aseptic techniques/medical practice/staphylococci/ampicillin/clinical practice.*||||||Taiwo, Olurotimi Olorunfemi|M|An eamination of selected witten test of senior secondary school learners in nigeria||||||M.Sc.

It also aimed at suggesting some approaches to the teaching of writing that will equip the students to write cohesively and. coherently. The methodology used involved the collection of data from some secondary schools in Osun, Ogun and Oyo States of Nigeria. The data were written texts representing four major genres of English written texts - Narrative, Explanatory, and Argumentative texts. The analysis focused on text-forming relations and consistency in register. In this respect, we made analysis of Reference, Lexical Cohesion, Conjunction, Theme, Ideational Meanings, and Schematic Structure The study discovered that the linguistic environment, the teacher and the students themselves play a great role in the kind  of texts produced by the students. Most of the writings of ESL writers do not reflect the distance between them and their reader, therefore, the texts were characterised by improper identification of participants, redundant references,  illogical connection of information and excessive use of simple additives. The study concluded by suggesting that ESL teachers in the teaching of writing should concentrate on Register which students learn implicitly. To achieve this, it was suggested that classroom teachers should focus on and define the writing tasks of the students. To do this, teachers should concentrate on the content of writing (Field), the channel of communication (mode), the audience of communication (Personal Tenor) and the purpose of communication (functional Tenor). In addition to this, it Was suggested that teachers of ESL learners should adopt the integrative approach to language teaching by not isolating skills that constitute language competence.|Theses collection|ESL/tenor/analysis of Reference/ Lexical Cohesion/Conjunction/Theme/Ideational Meanings/Schematic Structure/linguistic environment/language competence.*||||||Ibitoye, Oyewole Amos|M|A spillover effect of growth  centres: case study of osogbo sub-region||||||Ph.D. URP|Olajuyin, L.O.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Urban and Regional Science|1995|||OAU|||||xiiii, 284p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Unfortunately all studies conducted on growth centre's impact have centred on one time (place) pattern (Olajuyin, 1982; Abiodusn, 1981; Moseley. 1973a,1973b; Weinand, 1973) for absence of appropriate time series data for such studies. It is thus the object of this study to present a procedure for the testing of time pattern of spread/backwash effects and the application of this to Osogbo Sub-region of Nigeria using time series data to test the hypotheses of time pattern of spread and backwash and hence spillover effects.  The methodology adopted for the study focused on the review of   literatures, direct personal observation on the field and the examination of existing condition by use of questionnaires.The study finds out that the establishment of Osogbo steeI Rolling Company and Nigerian Machine Tools Limited has led to increased income and employment of migrants, natives and commuters. Heavy public and private capital has flown to  Osogbo, while significant capital goods movement and expenditure into and outside Osogbo sub-region have resulted in the establishment of the industries. Heavy effect has been felt through expenditure on housing, transport, food stuff and dependant relatives by industrial employees. Referred adult cases treated by specialised health services at Osogbo have also increased.  To test the hypotheses of time pattern of development the logistic function and marginal utility function were adopted to measure spread and backwash effects respectively. The high explanatory power of time for the spread and backwash effects in each of the areas shows that time is a very important explanatory variable of dependant variables (spread and backwash).The regression equations also confirm that spread and backwash and hence spillovers follow time path as spread and backwash effects increase with time. The time series analysis shows that time represents a good predictor of predictand variables of spread and backwash. Seasonal variation values adequately represent the actual spread and backwash values as the regression of actual values on trend and projected seasonal variation values produces R2- values of between 58% and 97%. The study confirms the hypotheses of time pattern of impact of growth centres. However the actual and full shapes of the curves are not I fitted because time is unripe for such differentiated structure. The study shows time path of impact in periphery and other places follow different patterns. The time pattern of spread, backwash and spillovers in the periphery shows that time is unripe for maximum benefits and disbenefits. This is the argument that initiated this study and on this basis it is suggested that policy makers should not abandon growth centre policy as a long time horizon is needed before it can really achieve positive spillovers (net spread). The study suggests policies to bring about maximum polarisation and rising spread in the periphery . |Theses collection|spread-backwash processes/osogbo steel rolling company/*||||||Ibitoye, Simeon Ademola|M|Development and adaptation of porters clay for use by local foundaries||||||M.Sc.

For the moulding sand, mixes of the sample of Ipetumodu potter's clay deposit and silica sand were produced and AFS cylindrical specimens were made. The green compression, dry compression, green shear, dry shear and hot strength and permeability of the mixes were then determined. Two out of nine mixes produced were selected as base sands and further treated with powdered charcoal and wood flour as additives. The effect of the additives on the tested properties was established and the results were later compared with those of moulding sand currently in use in local foundry. Five different mixes were prepared for the coresand, each containing potter's clay, silica sand, 2% wood flour, 5% water and different starch content. AFS standard cylindrical specimens were also prepared from each mix and the dry compression, dry shear, hot and baked strength, mould hardness, baked permeability and collapsibility were determined. The results obtained were compared with properties of coresand currently in use at local foundries. It was observed that with the addition of powdered charcoal and wood flour in amounts of 2.40 to 2.70% and 3.00 to 7.20% respectively to the prepared potter's clay - bound sand mixes, desirable moulding sands are obtainable. It was also noted that potter's clay - bound coresand mixes containing 2.10% wood flour and starch in the range of 1.50 to 1.95% exhibit desirable properties. Not only did the prepared sands compared favourably with the sand used in local foundries but exhibited in certain respects superior properties applicable in both iron and non-ferrous foundries. It was also established that the use of potter's clay in foundry core and moulding sands is feasible and economical and could be a potential substitute for imported bentonite in local foundries. |Theses collection|Potter's clay as binder in foundry moulding/coresand mixes/Ipetumodu potter's clay deposit/silica sand/AFS cylindrical specimen/foundry/wood flour.*||||||Onanuga, Kehinde Onakemi|F|Delimitation of hydrocarbon reservoir size from seismic velocity depth profiles over agigo oil field, niger delta||||||M.Sc.

Three regional faults and three horizons were picked at depths of 1400m, 1900m and 2800m respectively. The horizons divided the area into four layers: - Layer 1 belongs to the Benin Formation; Layers 2 and 3 fall within the Agbada Formation while Layer 4 belongs to the basal Akata Formation. The isochron maps of the tops of layers 2, 3 and 4 showed anticlinal structures faulted close to the fold axis. The presence of closures on these maps possible hydrocarbon bearing zones within the layers. Layer-l has an average thickness of 1320m and an average velocity ranging between 2000m/sec and 2111m/sec. Layer-2 has an interval velocity ranging between 2400m/sec and 2850m/sec while the sediment thickness varies between 460m and 560m. Layer-3 has an interval velocity varying from 2490m/sec to 3380m/sec while the sediment thickness ranges between 430m and 150m. The depth to the top of Layer-4 is between 2100m and 2900m. Areas with low interval velocities on the isovelocity maps indicate possible hydrocarbon bearing zones within the layers. Two hydrocarbon reservoirs were identified by the correlation of interpreted seismic sections with borehole logs from the AGHIGHO oil field. Reservoir 1 is located within layer-2 and spans the interval 1569m and 1712m while Reservoir 2 is located within layer-3 and span the interval 2034m and 2270m. Both reservoir sands contain intercalations of shale which seal the hierarchical hydrocarbon columns in the reservoirs. From the study of seismic velocity depth profiles across AGHIGHO field, a structural index based on velocity ratio was established. structural index maps were constructed to study the lateral extent of the hydrocarbon bearing areas within the reservoirs. The of horizon 1 indicated index values varying between 0.72 unit and 0.83 unit while the index values within reservoir 1 varied between 0.66 unit and 0.92 unit. The index map of horizon 2 showed variation of index values unit and 0.89 unit, while the index map of reservoir 2 showed variation of index values between 0.71 unit and 0.90 unit within the reservoir. Results of the delimitation in reservoir 1 indicated areas with index values greater than 0.83 unit as hydrocarbon bearing while areas with index values less than 0.83 unit as non-hydrocarbon bearing. Results of the delimitation in reservoir 2 indicated areas with index values greater than 0.80 unit as hydrocarbon bearing while areas with index values less than 0.80 unit as non-hydrocarbon bearing. Comparison of the results of the index maps with waveslowness maps showed good agreement. Reserve estimates were calculated for the volume of in place based on the results of the delimitation studies. In reservoir 1 it was calculated to be 1.48 x 108m3 and in reservoir 2 it was calculated to be 7.5 x 108m3. |Theses collection|Seismic sections/borehole logs/AGHIGHO oil field/isochron maps/hydrocarbon bearing. *||||||Omoregbee, Friday Egbena Abuwa|M|Communication of improved farm practices to rural women contract farmers in benue state, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

Specifically, the study was conducted to investigate the improved agricultural technologies disseminated to rural women contact farmers; the methods of communication between the extension workers and the rural women contact farmers; the channels used for getting feedback from rural women contact farmers by the extension workers as well as analyze the socio-economic factors which have influence on the frequency of contacts between extension workers and rural women contact farmers. BNARDA is statewide and it is divided into three zonal Headquarters. Each zone is divided into a number of wards, following the planning layout and sizes of the agricultural zones. Twenty-five wards were randomly selected. A total of two hundred and fifty rural women contact farmers were randomly selected. One hundred and fifty out of four hundred and forty-eight extension workers of BNARDA were randomly selected from the three zones. Questionnaire and interview schedules were developed and used for data collection from the extension agents and rural women contact farmers respectively.The results of' the study showed that several improved agricultural technologies were available in various degrees and disseminated by the extension agents to the rural women contact farmers. About 48 percent of the rural women contact farmers used the village extension workers as source of agricultural information while 98 percent of the extension workers used the subject matter specialists as source of agricultural information. Ninety-seven percent of the extension workers used the demonstration plots as a point of contact with the rural women contact farmers whi1e 90 percent of the rural women contact farmers recognized personal contacts, group meetings of farmers and method and result demonstration sites as channels through which they had contact and communicated with the extension workers. The extension workers found the impact of their message on the rural women contact farmers through women farmers' adoption of improved farm practices and their responses to training and meetings. The process of establishing communication and contact with the rural women contact farmers by the extension workers was hindered by non-ownership of radio/television and low 1eve1 of 1iteracy among rural women contact farmers. There was positive and significant interaction effect on the frequency of contacts the rural women contact farmers had with the extension workers and some of their socio-economic characteristics(educational attainment(b = 0.91); farm size (b = 0.117); and knowledge of extension workers office by the rural women contact farmers (b=0.48). |Theses collection|Communication/extension worker/Benue Agricultural and Rural Development Authority (BNARDA)/agricultural zones/rural women/improved farm practices *||||||Omole, Elizabeth Adebunmi|F|Effect of culturally induced stereotype on career orientation on adolescent females||||||M.Ed.

Women are seen by pioneers of comparative education as crucial factors in the process of national development. The controversial issue of which socializing model, (parents or peers) exert greater influence on the adolescents' choice of careers has remained unsolved. Some problems which teenagers encounter in choosing unrealistic careers such as the inability to cope with courses in their fields and ultimate lack of satisfaction in the world of work has persisted. The study investigated the relative influences of peers and parents on Nigerian adolescent choices. Four hypotheses were proposed and tested. One of the hypotheses confirmed that there was no significant difference between male and female adolescents in their orientation towards their peers in the choice of careers. Another indicated that there was no difference between urban and rural adolescents in their orientation towards their parents in their choice of career. The remaining two hypotheses showed that there is no significant difference between male and female adolescents in their orientation towards peers in their choice of career while the last one stated that there is no significant difference between rural and urban adolescents in their orientation towards peers in their choice of career. These two hypotheses were rejected. The study strongly recommends that since the adolescent is under the influence of both parents at home and peers in the school, the adolescents orientation will be a function of the interaction of both the parents and the peer group influences. The study recommends that counsellors, parents, teachers, and educationists should give the students thorough counselling on their choice of career. They should also improve the social relationship with adolescents so as to be able to provide more effective and realistic direction on adolescent career. |Theses collection|peers/national development/pioneers/careers/hypotheses/orientation/counselling  *||||||Ojolo, Bosede Olukemi|F|The organisation and management of rural women cooperative in osun state of nigeria||||||M.Sc.

Specifically, the study was designed to determine: members level of satisfaction with the derived organizational benefits, the organizational structure and decision-making pattern of the groups, the activities of the groups, the level of organizational participation of members, the acquisition and use of productive resources available to the cooperative groups and the nature and types of linkages existing between the cooperatives and the union, other cooperative societies, and relevant government agencies. Six Local Government Areas (LGAs) were randomly selected from the twenty-three LGAs in the state. Four women cooperative societies were randomly selected from each of the selected LGAs. A total of twenty-four women cooperatives were therefore used for the study. Twenty-five percent of the members were randomly selected from each cooperative, while four leaders of each cooperative were purposively selected and interviewed. A total of 306 respondents consisting of 210 members and 96 leaders constituted the subjects of the study. Two sets of interview schedules were used for data collection; one set was used for the leaders while the other was used for other members. Data analysis was undertaken by the use of frequency distribution, percentages, mean and Pearson's product moment correlation. Results showed that majority (59%) of the cooperative members were averagely satisfied with the derived organizational benefits; thirty-nine percent of the cooperative members and 58% of the leaders had formal education. Leadership training was not common to majority of the members. The organizational structure of the societies did not vary significantly. The management of each of the societies was vested on the management committee who reports back to the general body from time to time and decision-making pattern was mainly assembly decision-making. All the groups engaged in thrift and credit while some groups added other activities like trading, food crop production and food processing. Level of organizational participation by cooperative members was average for majority (82%) while 56% had good opinion about their groups. Access to land and labour was difficult. About 50% of the cooperative groups had no land to cultivate. The most frequent source of land acquisition was community land (29%) and used mainly for farming and processing. Most of the cooperative groups depended on group and hired labour for their farming operations. Capital acquisition was a great problem to most of the groups. The cooperative groups hardly had access to credit from the lending institutions due to high interest rate and lack of collateral. The cooperative union however provided loan for about 43% of the groups for members' use. Linkage existed between most of the groups and the union (87%), other cooperatives (84.4%) at the village level and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (85.5%). Problems facing cooperative groups were largely lack of adequate government assistance and difficulty in securing loan. Positive and significant relationships were found at 0.05 levels between members' level of satisfaction with the derived organizational benefits and annual income (r = 0.216), level of education (r = 0.215) and individual opinion about the organization (r = 0.457). Similarly, level of organizational participation was positively and significantly associated with level of education (r = 0.169) and annual income (r = 0.264). |Theses collection|Rural women/management/cooperative/organizational benefits/decision-making/organizational structure/cooperative structure/collateral.*||||||Ojo, Joshua Olufemi|M|Application of nuclear analytical technique to studies of elemental models in health and some diseases in man||||||Ph.D. Engineering Physics|Oluwole, A.F.// Durosimi, M.A.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Physics|1995|||OAU|||||xvi, 233p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Various factors that could lead to an optimum application of the two techniques for the biological matrices studied were also investigated. Results of the trace element levels in healthy humans provide, for the first time, baseline levels of these elements in hair, whole blood, erythrocytes and plasma of Nigerians. An epidemiological comparison of Nigerians with other populations from various parts of the world indicates that there are no serious differences in the trace elements contents of hair and blood of Nigerian subjects. The capability of the two analytical techniques in detecting various elements was also compared. Comparison of trace elements in the blood and hair of healthy and diseased Nigerians has clearly implicated trace elements in the three diseases studied. In SCA, the levels of the elements Cl, Cu, Fe, K, Na, P, Rb and Zn are significantly altered (p<0.005) both in erythrocytes and whole blood, while Zn is also significantly depressed in the plasma. Likewise, the elements Br, K, Zn and Cu (erythrocytes) and Br, Fe, Zn, Cu, and S (Plasma) are deranged in subjects with haematological malignancies; while P, S, Fe, Cu, Zn (erythrocytes) and K, Cu and Zn (plasma) are altered in those with affective disorders. Trace elements interaction and compartmentalization have also been further elucidated. Significant correlations were sought and found between pairs of elements in both hair and blood. In particular, the zinc and chlorine concentration in hair was found to be significantly correlated with the levels of the same elements in erythrocytes. Alterations in correlations between pairs of elements in patients suffering from the three diseases of interest were also rigorously sought and noted. Using Cluster analysis technique, a very fair discrimination between control subjects and those suffering from haematological malignancies and affective disorders, based strictly on the trace element milieu in their blood was obtained. From all these results, it is clear that more accurate prediction of the response of various trace elements pools in the body following derangements or perturbations in some elements in any of the interacting pools is now possible. Based on the various alterations attributable to sickle cell anaemia, haematological malignancies, and affective disorders, directions for future studies on these diseases that is more likely to result in concrete clinical gains have been indicated. It has been demonstrated that without recourse to complicated analytical regimes of irradiation, waiting and counting, or radionuclide separations, most elements of biological importance can be conveniently detected through their intermediate-lived isotopes (with half-lives of roughly several hours), while the others such as Ca, S, P, Pb could be assayed using PIXE as a complimentary technique. Several protocols including data analysis have been tested out and automated. This work is therefore open-ended and other diseases would be investigated as soon as the biological bases are established. |Theses collection|Nuclear analytical techniques/Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA)/Proton-Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE)/erythrocytes/plasma /Sickle Cell Anaemia (SCA)/Haematological malignancies/epidemiological/radionuclide separations.*||||||Omowe, Atime Daniel|M|The role of shell petroleum development company and the state in the underdevelopment of the niger delta of nigeria. 1937-1987||||||Ph.D. International Relations|Soremekun, K.// Sesay, A.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Internationalo Relations|1995|||OAU|||||xix, 322p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

It examined the process and nature of the underdevelopment of the area beginning from 1937 when Shell started operations there, to 1987 when most of the contradictions associated with oil production had fully unfolded. The data used in this study were obtained from library, archives and interviews. The method of extracting data from library and archival sources which were mainly books, journals and monographs, was that of analysis; for interviews, it was the open-ended questions. The study revealed that the Delta area for the period under review was underdeveloped. The activities of both Shell and the state deepened the incapacities of its inhabitants to meet most of their basic human needs such as food, shelter, pipe-borne water. It was also demonstrated in the study that the absence of a mining policy in the country accounted for their pollution of the environment of the area and the destruction of its economic State capitalism in the upstream sector of the petroleum industry as the study showed, placed great emphasis on the collection of oil rents. Consequently, it was unable to develop the local capability to find and win crude oil independent of Shell. Inspite of the Indigenization Decree, it was clear from the study that Shell Petroleum Development Company still remained wholly owned by its parent body in Europe: Royal Dutch/Shell Group. Although Shell had adequate environmental and labour policies which it implemented in Europe and the United States of America, the study found that they were not enforced in the country. The domestic bourgeoisie as demonstrated in the work was not involved in oil production. However, it played the role of a go-between for the state, Shell and the host oil communities mainly to satisfy its selfish economic and political interests.To be able to reverse the underdevelopment of the area particularly the effective control of the pollution of its environment, the state should cease concerning itself essentially with the collection of rents. The countrys indigenous technological base should be developed in order to reduce its (state) heavy reliance on the company so that it can control its operations.|Theses collection|Shell Petroleum Development Company/Niger Delta/petroleum industry/Indigenization Decree/environmental and labour policies/underdevelopment.*||||||Ojewale, Stephen Ayotunde|M|Effect of cognitve restructuring therapy on the self concept of physically disabled students in oyo state||||||M.A. Education (Guidance and Councelling)|Afolabi, E.R.I.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Educational Foundation and Councelling|1995|||OAU|||||viii, 84p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The main  objectives of the study were to determine the efficacy of CRT in improving the self-concept of physically disabled students and to find out whether students variables such as sex and age would significantly influence' the effectiveness of the therapy. The sample for the study consisted of twenty-four physically disabled students selected from Cheshire High School, Ijokodo, Ibadan. The subjects were randomly assigned into experimental and control I groups. The control group received no treatment. An instrument, the adolescent self-Concept Scale, developed by Burns (1977), was administered on the subjects both before and after treatment to determine the levels of their self-concept. The treatment programme was carried out for seven weeks consisting of seven sessions of one hour per session. Data obtained both prior to and after the administration of the therapy were analysed using t-test. The significance of the results was determined at 0.05 level of probability. Results of the data analyses showed that Cognitive Restructuring Therapy (CRT) was effective in improving the self-concept of physically disabled students. The therapy did not show any significant difference in improving the self-concept of subjects due to sex or age. These results suggest that CRT could be used to enhance the self-concept of a wide range of physically disabled students in Nigeria. |Theses collection|Cognitive Restructuring Therapy (CRT)/physically disabled students.*||||||Oni, Thimothy Olakunle|M|Factors affecting agricaltural credit utilization in selected banks in osun state||||||M.Sc.

The objectives of the study are to examine factors influencing agricultural credit use in the operation of smallholder agricultural credit scheme in the Nigerian Agricultural and Co-operative bank and the United Bank for Africa in achieving the goal of establishment coupled with reactivation and expansion of agricultural projects in Osun State. The Primary data were provided by 150 farmers randomly selected from credit beneficiaries of NACB and UBA in ten local government areas of Osun State. Structured questionnaires were used to collect data on personal and farming characteristics of beneficiaries. Other sources of data are the bank employees. The factors influencing credit use and repayment were determined by means of statistical and econometric analysis. The amount of loan obtained, amount of investment on farm, amount of interest repaid, extent of contact between the farmers and the banks, disbursement lag, farm size and farming experience serve as explanatory variables. The results obtained from regression analysis showed that the critical determinants of credit use and repayment are amount of loan obtained, disbursement lag and extent of contact between the farmers and the banks. The amount of loan obtained and extent of contact are positively related to amount repaid while disbursement lag is negatively Loan repayment rates showed 39 percent for NACB and 41 percent for UBA. Constraints on credit use and ability for repayment were found to include bureaucracy in lending policy and procedure, coupled with inadequate logistics and misconception among farmers to credit repayment. The study indicated that efforts directed at reducing these bottlenecks will enhance the use and repayment of credit. Based on the results obtained from the study the following policy recommendations were made. The banks' operational management should decentralise the implementation strategy in the smallholder agricultural credit scheme. In addition, the time interval between the period when application is submitted and when loan is disbursed to smallholder farmers should not be more than two months. A specialised department for loan monitoring and supervision should exist in bank's operation management that will direct loan to smallholder farmers. Also, the smallholder farmers should insure their crop enterprises against risks of loss due to pests, diseases and bad weather. The major contribution of this study to knowledge was that the results obtained from the study revealed that the amount of loan collected, the disbursement lag and the extent of farmers' contact with bank were the variables that significantly influenced the use and repayment of credit facilities. Expenses on hired labour were not significant. |Theses collection|credit facilities/smallholder farmers/co-operatives/moneylenders/'Esusu' groups/econometric analysis/Loan repayment rates/disbursement lag.*||||||Oniah, Victoria Ozoemezinem|F|Planning implications of environmental degradation in some oil producing community of delta state||||||M.Sc.

Based on the current world awareness on environmental problems, this study has become imperative, with a view to evaluating the effect of oil activities on the environment. The specific objectives of the study include: examining the genesis and nature of environmental degradation and its contributing factors; investigate the origin and geographic extent of oil drilling in the study area and effect on the inhabitants of these areas. To achieve these objectives, primary and secondary data were collected from relevant authorities including oil companies, planning offices, lands and survey divisions among others. The simple random sampling technique was applied to administer questionnaires to a total of 313 respondents out of which 198 respondents were indigenes of the oil producing areas and 115 respondents were the oil company staff. Findings were analysed empirically and statistically using correlation, cross tabulation and multivariate techniques. Results were also shown on table. Plates were used for illustrations. The study reveals that loss of farmlands and fishing ponds either through direct acquisition or environmental degradation from oil activities has led to increased pressure on available land and subsequently reduced farm size, fallow periods and crop\ catch yield. The study also shows that exploration and exploitation of oil has left the rural areas in a perpetual poor state as most of these localities are in remote, and impenetrable areas. The state of their environment has made it unhabitable hence the massive rural-urban migration. To check these problems the Oil Mineral Producing Areas Development Commission (OMPADEC) was established. Based on these findings policy recommendations have been tailored to reflect these findings. The recommendations are of three categories namely the oil companies, the Federal Government and its agencies and the indigenes of the oil producing areas. It is therefore suggested that Environmental planning and management is needed in all settlement to ensure healthy environment. There is need for community development, which can be achieved via dual effort through 40% contribution from the oil companies and 60% contribution from OMPADEC. This commission should also endeavour to convert the flared gas into generating electricity. There is need also for the integration of environment into economic development planning and decision making at all levels of government and private sector. Government should also create a friendly environment for both the operators and indigenes. The findings and recommendations, meant to ameliorate the problems identified will, no doubt, be of immense use in environmental planning and management and other related matters in other areas of oil exploration and exploitation in Nigeria. |Theses collection|Environmental degradation/global dimension/oil drilling/rural-urban migration/flared gas/Oil Mineral Producing Areas Development Commission (OMPADEC)/oil exploration/oil exploitation.*||||||Ohiosimuan, Oiseomaye Ohifeme|M|Production characteristics of rabbit breeds in the humid tropics||||||M.Sc.

Twenty rabbit does; 5 New Zealand White (NZW), 5 Chinchilla (CHS), 5 Californian (CAL) and 5 New Zealand White X Chinchilla (NZWXCHS), were fed forages (Ipomea batatas (L.) Lam., Aspilia Africana (pers.) Tridax procumbens (L.) and Euphorbia heterophylla (L.) ad libitum. Also, a commercial pelleted concentrate (PC) was offered at a rate of 33g per day for open or gravid does and 15g per doe and kid per day for lactating does. Doe and preweaning litter reproductive performance traits were recorded. For all the rabbits studied, the means obtained for doe weight at sexual maturity (DOEWTSM), doe weight at Successful matings (DOEWTSSM), doe weight pre-partum (DOEWTPP) and doe weight immediate post-partum (DOEWTIPP), were, 1.79kgi 1.96kgi 2.19kg and 1.99kg respectively. The mean litter size at birth (LSB), litter size alive at birth (LSAB), and litter size at weaning (LSW) I were, 5.93i 5.52 and 3.88 respectively. Means of 250.2g and 828.3g were obtained for litter birth weight (LBWT) and litter weaning weight (LWWT) respectively. For number of matings to conception (NMC), gestation length (GL), and kindling interval (KI) the means obtained were 2.35, 31.33 days and 118.76 days respectively, while the average mortality rate (MR) for offspring was 29.1%. The index (PI) calculated using litter birth weight and litter weaning weight were 768.97 and 2545.72 respectively for all the rabbit breeds. Breed differences (P<O.O5) were observed for DOEWTSM, DOEWTSSM, LSB, LSAB, LBWT, NMC and .KI. There were no significant breed differences (P>O.O5) .observed for DOEWTPP, DOEWTIPP, LSW, LWWT and GL.

Questionnaires and interview guides were administered to thirty-nine (39) Heads of Departments in the selected universities to obtain information on the extent and impacts of brain drain in their departments. Findings from the analysis of data showed that brain drain from the selected Nigerian Universities occurred because academic staff in Nigerian Universities were not adequately paid for the services rendered and that teaching equipment and facilities were iradequately provided. Consequently, the morale of  University lecturers was dampened. As a result, lecturers left the University system for the developed countries and private organisations in Nigeria and abroad. At  Obafemi Awolowo University, 11e-Ife twenty-seven percent (27%) of its lecturers left the institution in the last four years. A total percentage of thirteen percent (13%) left University of Ibadan, Ibadan and another thirteen percent (13%) left University of Lagos, Lagos. Some academic programmes were adversely affected and the quality of instruction was eroded. The University of Lagos required additional twenty-five percent (25%) to its established positions in the Faculties of Administration, Social Science and Engineering while the University of Ibadan required additional twenty-one percent (21%) to its established positions in the Faculties of Arts, Science and Law. Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife required additional thirty-five percent (35%) of its staff in the Faculties of Education, Agriculture and Dentistry.

All the soils have been identified to belong to two Association and have been  classified differently as Uitisols and Inceptisols. The first transect (TS-I) is located on an isolated landscape while the second transect (TS-2) ran from an lnselberg down to the stream channel. The parent materials of the upland soils of TS-l are basically residual as deduced from their morphological feature and physical properties. Quartz \/eins are the main sources of the of the gravelly horizon of soil identified as two. Series on TS-1 especially those located on the middle and shoulder positions landscape. Parent materials of TS-2 had undergone erosional /depositional cycles evidenced by multilayer parent rnaterials of colluvium on residuum. Moreover, In addition to abrupt and clear soil horizon boundaries within the profiles, stone lines within the pedons at the foot of the inselberg could further exp1ain their developments. The break in soil stratification is expressed by abrupt shifts of medium and fine sand subtractions on clay free base for TS-1 pedons while continuity of their parent materials is expressed by increase of these sand subtractions with an increasing depth. The multigenetic nature of TS-2 pedons is expressed by the regular and uniform to random distribution of sand subtraction on clay free base. The concavity of particles size curves of TS-1 upland pedons shows that they are well graded. This suggest probable preservation of soil parent materials. These parent mateials are subsequently transformed to soil regolith during pedo-genesis. Colluvial nature is expressed by steep multifaceted curves. This is an indication of poor sorting, and / or loss of certain soil fractions in pedons of TS-2.On TS-1, organic content of pedons decrease from surface horizons to subsurface while on TS-2 there is no define pattern of organic carbon distribution. The soil are generally not deficient in Ca2+ and Mg2+, but are low in Na+ and K+. Generally, breaks in horizon continuity in upland pedons especially on a rolling landscape like TS-1 do not necessarily indicate colluvial interruption of residuum but could be due to eluviation  illuviation processes and gravel addition from parent material or rock. The soil on the crestal position of TS-1 is described as basically sedentary and may be formed from any of these processes couple with mass wasting at the shoulder.|Theses collection|Soil/Uitisols/Inceptisols/parent material/Quartz \/eins/colluvium on residuum/pendons*||||||Oyedepo, Emiola, Adunni Ruth|F|A study of the efficacy of some wound dressing anticeptics against organisms isolated from sceptic wounds in two hospitals in ile-ife||||||M.Sc.

The study was directed at assessing the current resistance pattern of the organisms to these antiseptics and some of the antibiotics currently in use. The prevalent organisms implicated in the production of sepsis were also noted. One hundred and two wounds were studied; 94 yielded 162 organisms and 8 yielded no organisms on culturing. Swabs of the wounds were streaked on blood agar and mannitol salt agar. Bacteriological techniques were employed to identify the primary isolates which were then tested for antibiotic sensitivity using standard procedures. The efficacy of the antiseptics was tested by means of the disc-diffusion technique and the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).The predominant organism isolated from the wounds was Staphylococcus aureus constituting 24% of the total isolates. The enteric gram negative rods, altogether accounted for 49.7% of the isolates, with Escherichia coli contributing 13% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10%. The remaining 26.7% was contributed by 10 different species belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae. Trauma wounds which were predominant accounted for about 25% of the wounds. They were mostly located on the extremitites.Generally, the organisms were sensitive to chloramphenicol, streptomycin and gentamicin and resistant to ampicillin, penicillin, tetracycline and erythromycin. About 50% of the gram positive organisms were sensitive to cloxacillin while the gram negative organisms were resistant. The disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration procedures showed the following to be the order of efficacy of the antiseptics with a few variations, Hp > Sv > Ac > Eu. By the two methods eusol was ineffective in inhibiting or killing any of the organisms. Acriflavine was only partially effective, as the undiluted solution did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis. The 1:10 and 1:20 dilutions of savlon were only partially effective, they produced between 12 and 20mm zones of inhibition for all the organisms. Hydrogen peroxide was effective against all the organisms with diameters of zones of inhibition being 40mm and above. It exhibited a lower MIC than the other antiseptics with the gram negative organisms, except with E.coli and Ps.aeruginosa. Among the gram positive organisms the MIC of savlon was generally lower. The organisms most susceptible to savlon were Staphylococcus aureus , S. epidermidis, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus feacalis. The organism most susceptible to hydrogen peroxide was Streptococcus feacalis. Acriflavine was most effective against . epidermidis and Streptococcus feacalis. In this study Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the single most resistant organism and this may not be unconnected with its possession of inherent resistance and lipopolysaccharide complex. Eusol was found to be the most ineffective antiseptic, probably as a result of wrong handling of the antiseptic coupled with the development of resistance by the organisms themselves. It was recommended that use of the partially effective or ineffective antibiotics and antiseptics be strictly monitored.|Theses collection|disc-diffusion technique/minimum inhibitory concentration(MIC)/Pseudomonas aeruginosa/lipopolysaccharide/*||||||Osilana, Adebola Olutosin|M|Cloroquine disposition flowing reptile administration in man||||||M.Sc.

Yet, there is a strong and compelling need for urban resource managers and investors to understand the functioning of the socio-economic structure of urban environment so as to efficiently allocate, manage and exploit these resources. Following the dearth of reliable information on the residential and work-place location activities and the intra-urban movement of urban dwellers, real estate market participants have continuously had difficulties obtaining necessary information about the pattern of residential location requirements of households vis-a-vis the effect of their (the households) concern for proximity to workplace. This study therefore examined the variables of urban residential location decision, the elements of measuring accessibility, the role and degree of the collective and individual impact of these accessibility elements in house selection process and the link between the level of income of households and their analysis of accessibility to workplace in residential location decision-making.194 tenant households, 67 landlords, 9 caretakers and 7 firms of Estate Agents, Surveyor's and Valuers were examined in a stratified sampling survey conducted in April 1994 in Benin City, Edo State capital. Descriptive and inferential statistical models, including correlation and regression analysis were applied in the examination of the empirical evidence. The result showed a strong relationship between accessibility to workplace, income levels of  households and residential location decision-making in a traditional African urban area. Also established is that the socio- cultural affiliation of households to particular neighbourhood was a significant factor in residential location selection. This study thus recommended prudent and judicious measures for urban resource allocation, management and exploitation so as to promote urban structural and socio-economic efficiency and harmony. |Theses collection|urban residential location/traditional African cities/socio-economic structure/households.*||||||Obioh, Imoh Bassey|M|Inventorisation and modellinf of the emission of greenhouse pollutants in nigeria||||||Ph.D. Physics|Oluwole, A.F.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Physics|1995|||OAU|||||xxiii, 275|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

This will enable the prognosis of emission pathways for the emission relevant processes as well as the modelling of the various impacts on the atmospheric environment in Nigeria. Results provide an initial input to an expected National Emissions Data Systems (NEDS) being proposed. NEDS will be required as a modelling warehouse for emission, dispersion/deposition, atmospheric physico-chemical reactions, global warming and cost-effectiveness analysis of the control measures for these pollutants. Current emission estimates cover the whole federation as well as the states as minimum spatial grids where data is available. The emissions are also determined over a temporal range which allows emission trends to be evaluated. Source distribution comprises all the known combustion, industrial processes, biogenic and natural processes. Emission factors are partly measured by techniques of photometry, chemiluminescence, flame ionization detection for gaseous pollutants. Oxygen (02) measurement was based on the paramagnetic properties of oxygen molecule, and particulate matter by gravimetric techniques. Additional emissions factors were modelled from process analysis as well as from literature review. Emission spread sheet with about 150 processes was used to determine the gross emissions from all sources in Nigeria for the year 1988. Trend analysis of emission over the past 50 years was carried in major economic sectors. The use of impact prediction indices to determine probable implications of these emissions was carried out in respect of global warming phenomenon. Using a scale analysis of emissions in sectors, an emission reduction model based on four emission reduction scenarios was developed. Results show that the particulate emission for cement production in Nigeria is higher than US EPA figures by factors of between 2 and 3. Upstream oil and gas sectors show significant emission from gas flares which are higher than emission in gas fired utilities and public power generation. Annual emissions show that Nigeria is not a major source of the studied air pollutants on the global scale. Local sources conglomerate around Lagos, the Niger delta and the north central part of Nigeria. Annual emission rates in thousand tonnes are S02(87), NOx(926), CO(6700), PM(22360), VOC(6746), CH4(1050), Pb(2.8) and N20(8.7). Trends show annual growth rates of approximately 72% between 1960 and 1989 compared to 7.6% between 1940 and 1960. Annual emission rates have increased by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude during the period. Global warming monitored for Lagos, Calabar and Kano indicate increase of between 0.3 and 0.5C per decade. This is comparable to the global average reported as 0.3C. A reduction model based on a 4-scenario energy management and efficiency improvements options accordingly show that reduction in the flaring of natural gas holds the key to large scale reduction in all the plausible scenarios in the short term. |Theses collection|emission rates/greenhouse gases/National Emissions Data Systems (NEDS)/atmospheric environment/physico-chemical reactions/gravimetric techniques.*||||||Obasohan, Edward Eremwanrue|M|Development and simulation of a modified fourth-stage runge-kutta algorithm for sloving ordinary differential equations||||||M.Sc.

Although great advances have been made in numerical methods to obtain solutions to initial value problems in ordinary differential equations, there are many problems which seriously tax them. One such class of problems is stiff equations for which most existing explicit methods do not give a stable and reliable result. The need to improve on this lapse motivated the development of a new modified classical fourth-stage Runge-Kutta formula. Using, the conventional classical fourth-stage Runge-Kutta formula as a basis, a modified numerical method with rational incremental and stability function was developed. A computer program was designed to implement the proposed method in solving some initial-value problems in ordinary differential equations. Results obtained for the stability function indicate that the proposed formula has a stability interval (-3.875,0) compared to (-2.78,0) for the classical fourth order Runge-Kutta formula. The numerical solution obtained using various meshsizes further support the classical Runge Kutta formula as still the best one- step formula for handling simple nonstiff problems. However for a mildly stiff problem,  the result obtained for botl1 the proposed formula and the well known classical Runge-Kutta formula with a fixed meshsize (h) = 0.2 establishes the stability advantage of the proposed formula. |Theses collection|mathematical formulation/physical phenomena/differential equations/Runge-Kutta formula.*||||||Obembe, Olawole Odun|M|Vegetative propagation of cola nitida (vent.) schott and endlicher by plant tissue culture||||||M.Sc.

In this study, the micropropagation of C. nitida by means of tissue culture was investigated to provide baseline information on the responses of the explants to some growth media. Explant materials from young leaves and nodal segments of C. nitida seedings were cultured on modified Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different auxins and cytokininso. The implanted materials were incubated at 27+/-1oC under continuous light. Calluses were induced successfully from young leaf cultures on the medium supplemented with 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) 0.5-5.0mg/l and 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) 1.0n and with BAP 1.0-5.0m and NAA 1.0 mg/l. The best callus growth was obtained with NAA 1.0gm/l. Callus induction was also successful with nodal segments cultured on the medium supplemented with NAA 0.5-2.0mg/l and BAP 10.0m. Callus growth from nodal segments was best maintained on NAA 1.0mg/l. It was observed that the callus derived from the nodal segments showed the tendency of cell differentiation. This is an indication that nodal segment responded to treatments better than leaf explants. |Theses collection|hybrid sterility/micropropagation/Explant materials/Callus induction/C. nitida seedings.*||||||Nia, Rene|F|Isolation and characterisation of alkaloids from newbouldia leavis seem||||||M.Sc.

The different morphological parts of these species are traditionally used in Nigeria in the treatment of stomachial diseases. The MeOH extracts of these plants were screened phytochemically and also analysed chromatographically using standard techniques. Phytochemical tests showed that these plants contain flavonoids in all morphological parts while alkaloids were found mostly in their roots. Other constituents such as cardiac glycosides, tannins and saponins were of varied distribution in the different parts of each plant Antimicrobial tests of extracts of the different morphological parts showed weak activity against most of the test organisms indicating that its ethnomedicinal activity is not due to a activity against microorganisms. This suggests an activity due to physiological or pharmacological effects of the chemical constituents.Large scale fractionation of N. leavis rootbark led to the isolation of several compounds from samples collected both during the dry and raining seasons. Of these compounds, four alkaloids were characterised and identified as pyrazole alkaloids, which, are rare in nature. These alkaloids are withasomnine, 4'-hydroxy withasomnine, Newbouldine and 4'-hydroxy newbouldine, the last three being novel compounds.

A completely randomized design was used to allocate the birds to six -treatment groups with four replicates per treatment as follows: Treatment 1, Bilateral Castrates(48) with both testicles removed; Treatment 2, Left Castrates (48) with the left testicle removed; Treatment 3, Right Castrates (48) with the right testicle removed; Treatment 4, Sham Operated (48) with cockerels incised and both testiclcs examined but left intact; Treatment 5, Intact Males (48) serving as a control and Treatment 6, Intact Females (48) serving as a control. The Bilateral Castrates attaincd a mean body weight ,that was  significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that of  the Left Castrates, Intact Males and Intact Females at sixteen weeks of age. The mean red blood cell counts and white blood cell counts were lowered by caponization in all the treatments. The length of the femur(thigh bone), tibia (log bone),humerus, ulna and radius (wing bones) of' Bilateral Castrates were significnlltly (p < 0.05) longer than those of the Intact Males and Intact Females. However, no significant treatment differences were found when the weights of these bones were expressed as a percentage of the body weight. The lengths of the whole intestinal tract did not show any significant treatment differences. It was observed that any the gizzards and livers of Bilateral Castrates were significantly (p < 0.05) heavier than in the other treatments.  Although Bilateral Castrates had higher weights for the neck, breast, drum sticks, thighs, wings and back portions of the carcass, the percentage dressed and unevicerated weights did not show any significant treatment effects. The body weight, shank length, thigh length and keel length showed significantly (P <0.001) high positive correlations.   A flock mortality of 1.04 percent was recorded while capons and pullets were found to be more expensive to raise than intact cockerels to sixteen weeks of age. |Theses collection|caponization/chicks/Castrates/cockerels/gizzards/pullets.*||||||Mejiuni, Clara Olutoyin|F|An investigation into the training and development programmes for workers in private establishments in oyo, and lagos states, Nigeria||||||Ph.D.Ed.

The relationships between the measures of commitment of companies to training, the workforce and turnover of the companies were also examined. Attempts were made to find probable explanations for the observed levels of commitment of companies to training, the relationship between measures of commitment of companies to training and other relevant indicators. The sample for the study consisted of fourteen companies that were systematically selected from eight manufacturing- service and service industries in and around Lagos. Three research instruments were utilized to collect data from the companies selected for the study. The data collected were analysed using statistical models such as Fisher's Exact Test, Regression Analyses, and Pearson's Product Moment Correlation Coefficient. Data were also analysed by describing the phenomenon observed. All the hypotheses were tested at 0.05 level of significance. The results of the study indicated that a higher service companies (80%) expended money that was classified as high on training. When the amount expended on training was adjusted for the total workforce of the companies, the result showed that the expenditure on training per worker was dependent on whether the company was a manufacturing-service or service company. With an exact probability of larger value of .021, service companies came clear as being more committed to training than their manufacturing-service counterparts. Sixty six percent of large companies had high commitment rating as against 56% for giant companies. The results also revealed that the companies drew trainers from all the available sources for sourcing trainers - "in - house" and "out - of - house" and the companies had their own, or had access to the basic minimum physical facilities for training. The results showed that although the percentage of workers trained was not dependent on the nature and size of the companies, a higher percentage of service (60%) and large companies (66%) had high involvement in training. Finally, the factor that featured most prominently as the plausible explanation of the observed levels of involvement in companies to training, and the relationship between the measures of commitment to training and other relevant indicators, was the 'human - capital' theory, which is a strand of the Neo-classical economic theory. |Theses collection|private establishments/manufacturing-service counterparts/Neo-classical economic theory/workforce.*||||||Ogundahunsi, Sunday Dele|M|An assessment of development control strategy in ilesa local government, osun state||||||M.Sc.

The objectives of the study include the identification of existing development control machineries put in operation to meet the physical planning ideals of the local government, the assessment of their effectiveness and the response of the people to planning. Also, it includes the identification of associated problems arising from, the implementation of planning regulations and bye-laws in government. Data was derived through the administration of three types of questionnaires. One was administered on the staff of the local planning authority to collect information on building plan approval process, contravention and demolition cases regarding temporary sheds and permanent buildings, privately developed layouts and development schemes. The second one was administered on land developers for information on their perception of the planning process and the problems they encounter when applying for development permit. The third was administered on architectural draughtsmen who draw plans for land developers and get them approved at the local planning authority.Data procured from the questionnaires and other secondary information using percentage values and line graph to determine the state of development control in the local government. The analysis shows that development control has not been effectively and efficiently executed due to constraints such as of master plan, staff inadequacy, laxity among planning officers. Other constraints are lack of adequate finance planning authority, inadequacy of existing institutional framework for development control practices and undue overuse of land by land developers.In the work, it is recommended that a blue print for development in the form of master plan be procured for the local government. The planning authority needs to be adequately funded and staffed to increase its effectiveness and efficiency. Following this, the building bye-laws and instruments of development control need to be reviewed to facilitate easy administration of physical development works in the local government. |Theses collection|development control machineries/bye-laws/development permit/architectural draughtsmen/questionnaires.*||||||Ofordi, Ignatius Chidebe|M|Some discourse features of selected interviews in english of Nigerian politicinas and journalists||||||M.A. ESL|Adegbite, W.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, English|1995|||OAU|||||xi,176p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Specifically, it did three things: describing the structure and organisation of the content of conversational interaction between journalists and politicians in the interviews, observing the communication strategies and motivations of the participants in negotiating the interactions, and also observing the orientation of participants towards each other and towards the subject matter of the interviews.The methodology used involved the collection of data from interviews conducted in both the electronic and the print media. The data were used to illustrate the various features of interactions in the interviews- including the structure, transactions, exchanges, moves and acts - and the strategies used by participants in the negotiation of meaning. The findings of the study revealed (1) that the Initiation-Response (IR) structure was the predominant exchange  structure in the interactions, with the response (R) move having, more potentials of extension than the rest of the moves;  (2) that the journalist initiated exchanges, used frames, introduced topics and controlled the interaction, while the politician could not; (3) that politicians replied cooperatively when questions helped to further their cause and evaded questions that did not promote their interests; (4) that journalists asked sensitive questions sometimes with the intention to ridicule, expose, indict or implicate the, politicians or other people, whose behaviour were anti-social. The conclusion of the thesis summarised the features of discourse structure, orqanisation and participation observed In addition, it suggested the need for further studies on the negotiation of meaning in journalist  politician interviews, particularly on the role of intonation in interviews. It also suggested the need to relate the above findings from interviews to other types of discourse. |Theses collection|Initiation-Response (IR)/print media/politicians/journalist.*||||||Fatuase, Alfred Adeniyi|M|Application of ausubelian advance organiser theory as a strategy for enhancing reading comprehensin among junior secondary schools in ondo state||||||M.A.Ed.

Twenty secondary schools were visited in order to carry out the examination and assessment of both the teaching strategies and the learning supports. Student enrolment in the schools was twelve thousand nine hundred and forty five, while all together the physical education specialists for the schools were thirty one only. The findings show that: All the schools have physical education as a subject within the programmes. The teacher - student level of relationship is not cordial enough to stimulate adequate and effective learning. Also, each student is not accorded enough respect as a distinctive person. This is because each learner has special developmental needs that require indiv1dualised attention and supervision.

The subjects of the study were one hundred and twenty undergraduate students (comprising of 72 females and 48 males) randomly selected in the Faculty of Education, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. The instruments of the study consisted of standardised self report inventories and a battery of achievement tests which were adequately validated. Both tests were administered on the subjects over a period of time. The resulting data were analysed using relevant correlational analysis procedures and the analysis of variance at 0.05 level of significance. Results of the analyses indicated that there exists a positive and I statistically significant relationship between extraversion, risk-taking, I state anxiety and guessing behaviour. Negative and statistically significant correlations were obtained between guessing behaviour and self concept (SC) in all the MC formats, and also between guessing behaviour and in achievement (NA) in both 4-MC and 5-MC formats. The result also revealed that guessing behaviour is significantly related to academic ability with the tendency to guess increasing with ability. It was also found that guessing behaviour is significantly affected by test item format, with most guessing taking place in the 5-MC format. Thus, students who are extraverted, are text anxious and are high risk takers, are likely to guess in multiple-choice tests while those who have a favourable concept of themselves and those who are well motivated to achieve are less likely to guess in multiple-choice tests. |Theses collection|self concept/risk-taking/need achievement/anxiety/extraversion/locus of control/impulsiveness/multiple-choice tests.*||||||Fasoro, Joseph Oluotimi|M|Justification in ethics||||||Ph.D. Philosophy|Fasina, O.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Philosophy|1995|||OAU|||||xii, 364p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

In addition, it attempted to establish that proper justification of moral judgements or ethical statements need not be an infallible set of propositions, and that moral justification should be assessed by some criteria of adequacy. The methodology used in this work included library research. Books and journals on current debates on meta-ethical theories were consulted. The method of critical and conceptual analysis was also employed. The thesis found that an excessively abstract approach to justification has been an obstruction to the resolution of disputes in meta-ethics. It also found that the adequacy of moral justification was not to be determined by the philosopher's ability to satisfy the sceptic's demand for an indisputable moral purpose. The thesis concluded that the contractarian rational choice theory is the most plausible philosophical basis for the adequacy of objective justification.

The study specifically determined the effectiveness of the Training and Visit extension system; identified the organization extension worker and farmer-related factors that are associated with the effectiveness. The study was conducted in five purposively selected rural local government areas, namely: Agege, IbeJu-Lekki, Epe, Ikorodu and Badagry in Lagos State. Structured interview schedule was used to elicit information from two hundred and fourteen full-time farmers. Seventy-three copies of Questionnaires were completed by LSADP extension workers. Frequency and percentage distributions, means, standard deviation and lorenz curve were used the data. Correlation analysis was used to test the hypotheses formulated; Factor and component analyses were used to isolate the crucial factors with the effectiveness of the Training and Visit extension system. The results showed that the effectiveness score was average. Only two organizational factors namely; number of superior/Village Extension Worker (VEW) (r = 0.233) and number of participants at Fortnightly Training (FNT) session (r = 0.335) were significantly associated with effectiveness. While only seven Extension worker-related factors were significantly related to effectiveness, fourteen farmer-related factors were significantly associated with the effectiveness the Training and Visit extension system. Extension worker-related factors were age (r = -0.2981); number of extension contacts with farmers (r = O. 3624); number of training sessions given to farmers (r=0.2697); number of visits paid to farmers (r=0.5717); number of demonstrations given to farmers (r=0.6618), number of advice given to farmers (r=O. 5549), and number of SPAT plots established (r=0.5854). Farmer-related factors were: age (r=0.4936); family size (r=0.362); hired labour (r=0.4617); familiarity with VEWS (r=-0.3708); membership participation in group (r=0.3077); farmers' perception of VEWS (r=0.229), knowledge of crop production (r=0.3627), farm size (r = 0.2448), crop yield (r=-0.7826); adoption score (r=O.36ll); number of contacts had with VEWS (r=0.7536); number of demonstrations had (r=0.4739); number of SPAT plots established with YEW (r=0.8384), and number of advisory services had (r=O. 5167).

Specifically, the study examined the relationship between family structure and juvenile delinquency and the implications of delinquency for the society. Data for the analysis were obtained primarily from the questionnaire designed to elicit information from respondents in respect of their family background. The questionnaire contained items which were mostly close-ended while some were open-ended in nature. Respondents were divided into two groups: the delinquent experimental group and the non-delinquent control group. The descriptive technique with the use of frequency tables and cross tabulations were used to analyse the data collected. Our study reveals that 56.25% of the delinquents said they came from broken homes against 75.00% of the non-delinquents who said they came from intact homes. Thus, our findings reveal that family breakdown is a contributory factor to delinquency causation. Also, our study reveals that 62.50% of the delinquents said they were rniddle born children while 37.50% of the delinquents said they were first and second born children. Hence, our findings reveal that sibling order of children is a contributory factor to delinquency causation. Our study also reveals that 67.08% of the delinquents claimed that their peer groups had influence on why they became delinquents while 22.92% of the delinquents said their peer groups had weak or no influence on their delinquent acts. Thus, our findings peer groups is a contributory factor to delinquency causation. Based on the findings of the study, we recommend that a family Counselling Unit counsel troubled the negative implications of divorce while parents should try to closely monitor the activities of their children and the kind of friends they move with. |Theses collection|family structure/juvenile delinquency/non-delinquent control group/delinquent experimental group/broken homes/peer groups/family Counselling Unit/divorce.*||||||Eyeh, Stephen Obrthe|M|Images of space and objects in ayi kwei armah's fiction||||||M.A. Literature in English|Kolawole, M.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, English|1995|||OAU|||||viii, 133p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The study aimed at showing that this stylistic device is utilised not only to show art for arts sake, but for arts to arouse a social consciousness and ideological vision.The methodology used involved the identification of various spatial images and objects in Armah's The Beautiful Ones Are Not Yet Born. Fragments, Why Are we so Blest? Two Thousand Season and The Healers. Images of similar nature were classified so as to determine their functions and their symbolic implications to social reality. The recurrent images in all the novels were studied in order to reveal their intra and inter-textual relationship. This helps to determine the consistency of Armah as an Artist in his use of images to form his ideological stance or vision. In addition, spatial objects like buildings, harbour and other objects such as money and cars were analysed as symbols that contributed to the expression of Armah's ideological stance and vision.The study showed that characters were deployed as individuals that occupy spatial and moral space and whose interactions and movements from one place to the other have symbolic implications. Among them are the highly individualistic characters that constitute the manipulative and the higher group oppressors. But the ordinary characters connote humanity and communality. It also showed that Armah built on these two categories of characters to reveal class conflict and establish a universal ideology of the peasants versus the bourgeoisie. The study also showed that Armah's five novels are a manifestation of profound intellectual and scholarly efforts to promote human existence devoid of avarice and decadence. It was concluded that Armah's imagery are worth studying because he has used them to present a chronology of events from the period of traditional society, to the modern post-indpendence periods. He has sifted the good of collective living, 'the way', from the traditional African society as a way forward in the present time instead of the individualism of African leaders. |Theses collection|social consciousness/ideological vision/inter-textual relationship/bourgeoisie/peasants.*||||||Esu, Dada Gabriel|M|The effects of an eight-weed physical activity training programme on the physical fitness status of deaf children in Ondo State||||||M.A. Physical Education|Okurotifa, E.G.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Physical Education|1995|||OAU|||||x,93p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

This disease is largely treated with organophosphorus and chlorinated hydrocarbons which, in Nigeria, are mainly imported hence scarce and expensive. Experiments were then carried out to investigate the prevalence of this disease; and also the effects of a locally available herb as an alternative remedy for the disease.A survey of 12 pig farms was carried out to determine the prevalence of sarcoptic mange in lbadan, Ile-lfe and llesa areas of South-Western Nigeria. Identification and phytochemical analysis of the local herb (Heliotropium indicum Linn. ) was also carried out. Crude water extract (W.E). petroleum ether extract (P.E.E) and fresh juice of the herb (F.H.J) were tested for acaricidal activity against sarcoptes mites in vitro. Mortalities of Mites were recorded after 1 hour, 2 and 8 hours; and compared with mortality in ivomectin (a conventional drug) treatment. Clinical trial of the herb extracts was carried out. by topical application to mange infested pigs on days 0, 8, and 16. Parasitological assessments were by microscopic examination of skin scrapings obtained 3 days after each application, and then 21 days after the last herbal treatment. Effects of the herb extracts were compared with a single injection of the recommended dose of ivomectin.Results of the survey showed that about 92% of the farms had pigs infested with mange. Fifty percent of the 842 pigs in the farms were infested, and 205 pigs of these were not treated. Phytochemical analysis of the herb showed that H. indicum contains alkaloids, saponins and tannins. The mean percentage mortalities of mites in the herb extracts were 84.13%. 95.56% and 99.08% respectively for W.E., F.H.J. and P.E.E. while ivomectin treatment had 100 percent. There was no significant difference between ivomectin and the herb extracts; but the four treatments differed significantly from the control (treatment with distilled water). In the clinical trial, W.E.. P.E.E. and F.H.J. had 43.51%. 82.17%, and 84.99% mean reductions of mites respectively, while ivomectin had 37.46 percent. However, there was no significant difference between ivomectin, P.E.E. and F.H.J., but the 3 treatments differed significantly (P < 0.05) from W.E. treatment.

The study was also designed to examine if students' subject specialisation(s) will significantly influence their profit from testwiseness training.The study made use of pretest-posttest control group design with 120 senior secondary school III non-testwise students selected by stratified random sampling. They were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The study made use of a self constructed Student Testwiseness Scale (STS) using Bishop and Ebel (1965) testwiseness principles. A TestwisenessTraining Package (TTP) was also developed using the same principles. Furthermore, an Achievement Test Battery (ATB) consisting of test items in English Language, Biology and Economics written three different objective test formats (multiple choice, True-false, and completion) was also developed. All the instruments were adequately tested for reliability and validity. Pre-treatment scores of the STS were used to identify non-testwise students. The latter were thereafter randomly assigned to experimental and control groups consisting of 60 students per group. The experimental group was given a six-week testwiseness training of five sessions. The control group was given placebo treatment. The two groups were presented the student testwiseness scale after the treatment. One-way analysis of variance, t-test and multiple comparisons (T - method) were used in data analysis.Results of data analyses indicate that testwiseness training significantly improved students' academic performance. Further, the effect of testwiseness training on the performance of students with different levels of academic ability was not significant.

It began by looking at findings in the literature on determinants of political behaviour particularly voting. From there the study went on to discuss the evolution of electoral participation in Nigeria and then placing it within the political economic context of Nigeria. This was followed by discussion and analysis of findings of the field research conducted in Akwa Ibom State to identify the determinants of voter behaviour in the state. The methodology employed in the study was both quantitative and qualitative. On the one hand, questionnaires and structured interviews were used to collect data from a sample of voters selected from purposively sampled areas. The investigation centred on demographic characteristics of respondents as well as the role of money and group solidarity on voters choice. Later on, the variables so collated were correlated with patterns of voter behaviour. On the other hand, the qualitative method relied on the political economy approach to explain the findings revealed by the survey research. A few of the findings met expectations. For example, the majority of voters were in the 30 to 49 age bracket. This is as the literature predict. However the relatively high voting rate of 18 and 29 age bracket contradicts expectations. Similarly, against all expectations, the open ballot system adopted during the elections did not significantly disenfranchise voters. In the same vein, the study cannot establish that education and occupation influence voter turn- out significantly. However, the most interesting finding, in our judgement, concerns the role of money and group solidarity in the determination of voter choice and behaviour. In this area, we found that voters in the lower socio economic status were more disposed toward accepting bribes during election than the upper socio-economic status voters. In contrast, the upper socio-economic status voters were more interested in ensuring group solidarity than in material gratification during election. They appear to be willing to defer their rewards. They probably know that material benefit will follow in the form of appointments and contracts when the election is won. Using the political economy approach, therefore, the study explained this incident as a function of the rentier and patrimonial nature of the Nigerian state.  A few of the findings met expectations.

They are commonly located in areas littered with decaying vegetable matters which they feed on. When the haemolymph of this organism was passed through Sephadex G-200, the resin was digested. The ability of snail to digest vegetable matters and the digestion of sephadex G-200 resin by the haemolymph led to the suspicion of the presence of cellulase in snail haemolymph. Cellulase from the haemolymph of the giant African snail (Archachatina marginata) was purified to homogeneity by a combination of Gel filtration on BioGel P-300 and ion exchange chromatography on DEAE - Sephadex A-SO. The homogeneity of the pure enzyme was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence and presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate. The sub-unit molecular weight was 16,875+/- 1,556 daltons and the apparent molecular weight as determined by gel filtration was 52,000 daltons. Thus the enzyme is at least a dimer. The enzyme had a specific activity of 1359.09 units/mg of protein. The Michaelis-Menten constant Km for CM-cellulose was 5.17+/- 0.74 mg/ml and the Vmax was 1067+/- 195 units/ml. The enzyme did not degrade salicin, cellobiose and O-nitrophenyl -D-glucopyranoside. Its activities towards filter paper and cotton wool were insignificant compared with its activity towards CM-cellulose. Linamarin was found to inhibit the action of the enzyme to about 18%. The high specificity for CM-cellulose and the rapid decrease in the viscosity of CM-cellulose suggests that the enzyme is likely an endoglucanase. |Theses collection|giant African snails (Archachatina marginata)/herbivorous tropical gastropods/vegetable matters/haemolymph/Gel filtration/chromatography/Michaelis-Menten constant/electrophoresis.*||||||Gbadebo, Adewole Michael|M|Biostratigraphy and paleoecology of meren-a and meren-b wells niger delta, nigeria||||||M.Sc.

Additionally, the lithologic sequences in the wells have been studied and analysed. The main objective of this study has been to establish the age(s) of the sediments, zone them biostratigraphically, determine the environment in which the sediments were deposited and finally attempt gross correlation of the two wells that have been studied. Lithostratigraphic interpretation of the two wells resulted in the delineation of two informal units referred to as Unit X and unit Y. These units exhibit lithologic characters similar to the Lower and Upper Agbada Formation. Based on palynomorph contents, three zones have been erected for the two wells. These are Nymphaea lotus (Late Miocene age), Gemmamonoporites sp. (Late Miocene age) and Echiperiporites cf estelae (Early Pliocene age); foraminiferal biostratigraphical zones ranging through Late Miocene/Early Pliocene age include: Globorotalia dutertrei (Late Miocene) and Globigerina nepenthes (Early Pliocene) for the planktonic foraminifera of the two studied wells. Similarly, the inferred benthonic foraminiferal zones of Meren-A from base to top are: Uvigerina peregrina/Quinqueloculina seminulum, Lenticulina vortex/Triloculina sp., Florilus costiferum/Lagena sulcata and Marginulina raphanus. Those of Meren-B in ascending order are Uvigerina sparsicostata/Sigmolina schlumbergeri,  Quinqueloculina microcostata/Lenticulina vortex and Lenticulina Formosa/Lagena sulcata zones.

The work identified vituperative songs as a genre of Yoruba orature and described its structure as found in Ife dialect. It also examined its various uses as observed among these people. Vituperative songs were collected in Ile-Ife as well as in towns where the dialect is spoken. These towns include Ife, Ifeetedo, Oke-Igbo and Ifewara. The structuralist theory provided the theoretical framework for the analysis of the structure and uses of the vituperative songs collected. The structure of the songs showed that each song datum was rendered in very short stanzas of not more than four or five poetic sentences. Where a vituperative song was more than five sentences, the exponent would repeat part or whole of the five sentences. Also, it was found that repetition is an important stylistic feature of vituperative songs and that this accounted for the rhythmic structure of the songs. The rhythms of vituperative songs were often symbiotically complemented with kinesics which enabled the creator exponent introduced linguistic devices of aesthethic significance into the songs. All these combined make the songs functional. Another finding is that the exponent of the songs were mostly females of varying ages. The audiences of the songs were usually the target of the vituperative songs. The exponent usually sang to express their personal emotions al though the songs could also be used to correct social ills of the society. Such ills are many and varied. Two examples will suffice here viz:One, a man planning to seduce a young girl, Two, the consequences of laziness in the society. They could also be means of finding lasting solutions to quarrels in the society. |x, 183p|||||||Yoruba||Obafemi Awolowo University, H. O. Library, Ile-Ife, Osun State.

The government has been concerned with its eradication. But before an effective eradication can be achieved, there is need for information on people's perception, beliefs and practices about the disease, The study examined the knowledge, attitude and practices relevant to guinea worm disease and its socio-economic costs in The rural areas of Aramoko, Ekiti.The study was undertaken between mid March to April ending 1995. Using multistage sampling technique, a total of 220 respondents were selected. Only 162 cooperated and completed the questionnaires. Thirteen patients were also interviewed to determine the socio-economic costs of the disease. Two traditional and two western orthodox health service providers were interviewed on the mode of management. The research instruments were semi-structured questionnaires, and in-depth interview schedules. Data obtained were mainly qualitative. The quantitative data from the semi-structure questionnaires were analysed using simple percentages. The qualitative data were analysed using sample categorization of responses and some interesting responses were quoted in the tent.The study showed that the people in the community tended to perceive guinea worm disease within the preternatural and supernatural realms and consequently the traditional healers were preferred for its management than the western orthodox practitioners. Also it was observed that the socio-economic cost of the disease tended to vary with the types of jobs that patients engaged in. It was particularly high among the farmers as they could not go to the farm at all during the illness episodes. Another major finding was that people in these rural areas rely mainly on water from streams and wells since the taps were not functioning.Recommendations emanating from the findings are: (i) the need for health education and (ii) the need to provide portable water to the rural areas.|Theses collection|Guinea worm disease/public health problem/orthodox health service.*||||||Omobuwajo, Olarenwaju rita-marie|F|Heartwood constituents of pcynanthus anglolensis welw and baphia nitida lodd||||||Ph.D. Pharmacognosy|Adesanya, S.A.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Pharmacognosy|1995|||OAU|||||xii, 125p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

These tropical woods are fast disappearing due to indiscriminate cropping. This poses a potential danger in forestry and to those heartwoods known to have ethnomedicinal uses. One of the uses of certain types of wood is as chewing sticks. Earlier investigations have shown that such sticks possess antimicrobial properties. This work extends such investigation to the woods of Baphia nitida Lodd and Pcynanthus angolensis Welw. used locally as chewing sticks. These woods were extracted with organic solvents and, after establishing antimicrobial, activity in the extracts, were fractionated using column chromatography respectively. The fractions were purified using a combination of chromatographic techniques to give pure compounds some of which were identified and characterised on the basis of their mass, nmr and uv spectroscopic data. Out of eleven compounds isolated from P.angolensis, three were characterised as - sitosterol, 2'-hydroxyformononetin and a novel isoflavone 7, 4'-dimethoxy 2'- hydroxyisoflavone. Fourteen compounds were isolated from B. nitida out of which three were identified as -sitosterol, sativan, medicarpin and a fourth partially characterised as an isoflavene. Antimicrobial assay of some of the isolated compounds showed no appreciable activity for -sitosterol and other compounds from P angolensis except 2'-hydroxyformononetin and 7, 4'-dimethoxy 2'-hydroxyisoflavone. The former was active against Escherichia coli (NCTC I 0418) and Aspergillus niger at 360g/ml respectively while the latter was active against the same organisms at 360 and 350 g/ml respectively. In conclusion, further work will be required to isolate other active compounds that are present in minute quantities in both plants. |Theses collection|insect attack/microbial degradation/tensile strength/artisans/heartwoods/ethnomedicinal/chewing sticks/antimicrobial/chromatography/spectroscopic data/novel isoflavone.*||||||Olufajo, Arinpe Gbekelolu|M|Isefe ninu asayan ere-onitan apileko yoruba||||||Ph.D. Yoruba|Ilesanmi, T.N.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Afican Languages and literature|1995|||OAU|||||xii, 231p|||||||Yoruba||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

It analysed the forms of satire in some selected Yoruba written plays relating to eligious leaders and followers and the evils perpetrated religious ome families and political leaders.The methodology employed for the study included oral interviews on the definition and functions of the concept of satire. A review of relevant literature on satire and humor in general was carried out. Finally, the theoretical framework for analysis of the texts was a blend of the cultural and Marxist approaches to the study of literature.Taking cognizance of the forms of satire, the thesis discovered that Yoruba written plays could be generally classified into two: one , pure Satirical plays (ere-onitan plays that make mere allusion to satirical sketches in their  oncepts.The thesis also discovered that the term Efe (satire) is interchargeably used in place of other of humor like par (jokes), Awada forms Awada (jest) and (Ridicule). Thus, the thesis observed that though a sharp distinction could not be made between these forms, the aim of satire distinguished it from the others. Its aim is to bring a positive change to the society by ridiculing the fools and the  vices in a deviant. It was also discovered that satire failed to achieve its surpossed aim in modern Yoruba society due to misplaced priorities in the societal value.The thesis concluded that the major source of the satire found in the analysed texts is 'oppression" which permiates the society at large.

All the subjects were between 20 and 30 years of age. Ten (10) healthy normotensive pregnant Nigerian women and five (5) normotensive partum matched for age, parity and stage of pregnancy served as controls.

The third trimester result for plasma T4 levels in each category of women was Significantly higher than that of the second trimester.  The ANOVA results confirm that with respect to plasma T4 levels the pregnancy whether hypertensive or normotensive is stage dependent. The second trimester plasma T3 levels of 2.7  0.26 nmol/Litre for hypertensive women was significantly higher than 2.10  0.25 nmol/Litre for their normotensive counterparts. No other significant difference was observed.

It investigated how various English structures and lexical items are used by these newspapers in projecting various socio-politically determined shades of opinions and beliefs within the society. The study focused specifically on editorials as the areas where the various ideologies are most clearly established and the stances the newspapers take towards issues and events most readily discernible. The data for the study were selected editorial texts from the Daily Times, The Guardian the Nigerian Tribune and the New Nigerian. The subjects of the selected editorials were on the nationally important issues of religion, labour relations and politics. As a result, the various ideologies that threw up the editorials were such that cut across diverse interests and institutions within the Nigerian polity. The thesis employed the methods of critical linguistics. Thus, it involved identifying the significant structures and lexical items in the editorials and examining their use and functions against the background of relevant ideologies. The analysis involved examining the editorial texts sentence by sentence in order to give the imbrication of language and ideology adequate attention.  From the analysis, it was clear that in projecting their various ideological viewpoints, Nigerian English-medium newspapers employ various linguistic devices all of which involve careful and methodical manipulation of structures and items within the English Language. It was found that among the most widely used of these linguistic devices are thematization, passivisation and nominalization. The choice of intensive/extensive constructions and varying arrangements of the main and subordinate clauses within the complex sentence structure were found to be among the very potent mean of showing ideological learning. The analysis revealed the pervasive use of lexical items (often emotively charged) as textual nodes for contriving ideological insinuations. |Theses collection|Nigerian English-medium newspapers/language and ideology/thematization, passivisation and nominalization. *||||||Olatubara, Charles Olufisayo|M|Activity patterns and urban residential location decision in ibadan, oyo state||||||Ph.D. Geography|Ogunjumo, E.A.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Geography|1995|||OAU|||||xvi, 161p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The search for an optimum residential location has been a source of chronic problem to the urban dwellers. Transportation problems of workers and other residents in lbadan including traffic congestion, reduction in the number of public transport vehicles and increasing commuting cost, further tend to increase the difficulty of getting easy access to activity nodes patronized by households. Sub-optimal residential locations of households in relation to the distribution of urban activity nodes tend to increase the cost and time budgets of households in addition to other socio-psychological problems. Some households, however, have constrained choice in which households simply occupy existing vacancies. The research approaches the issue from the standpoint of activity distribution of households and how such distributions affect their residential location decisions. Ibadan has been used as the study area for this work. Seven hundred and thirty six (736) household heads provided the basic data for this study. A network of grids was superimposed on an updated map of Ibadan and a systematic sampling of a residential building in every other grid intersection was carried out across the city. Several simple and multivariate techniques were used to analyse the data. The study revealed some departures from existing propositions of earlier research efforts. It was discovered that households did not necessarily choose their residential locations in relation to the city centre used in this study. Households appeared to show a tendency towards proximity to their activity centres. This is reflected across the urban space irrespective of such locations in relation to the city centre. Some households also showed a tendency to change residential locations when the activity centres patronized by such households appeared to be inconvenient. Others, however, failed to change their residential locations even when some factors should ordinarily make them change residences. Based on these findings, it is recommended that household units and their activity patterns be adopted in a neighbourhood approach to facility planning and location. A modification is also proposed in the use of this concept for urban landuse planning.|Theses collection|Urban residents/traffic congestion/public transport vehicles/socio-psychological problems.*||||||Olaluwoye, Olaniyi Olakanye|M|Ferminist aesthetics in selected works of buchi emecheta||||||M.A. Literature in English|Kolawole, M.E.M||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,  English|1995|||OAU|||||vii, 96p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Among such writers is Buchi Emecheta. Therefore, the thesis aimed at studying and analysing the works of Buchi Emecheta within the concept of feminism to determine how much she portrayed feminist consciousness. It also aimed at assessing the unique feminine perspective, themes and images of women in her works and evaluating them within the framework of a woman as a spokesperson for her gender vis-a-vis the existing male depictions of womanhood. The methodology used involved a theoretical approach, which examined the concept of feminism and then related it to the works of Buchi Emecheta. To achieve this, a critical examination of four selected novels from her works was undertaken. The feminist characteristics in the works were identified with specific reference to the themes, characters, characterization and ideological tools. In addition, references were made to Emechetas claim by citing critical comments and interviews on her works. The work concluded that literature by women provide insight into female experiences and also challenged male chauvinism. It established Buchi Emecheta as a feminist writer whose works proved that, contrary to the complacent image of women presented by some African male writers, women are fulfilled human beings who know what they want and how to get it. She is a feminist who successfully probed deeply into the female psyche in a patriarchal society where women are expected to be seen but not heard. Buchi Emecheta achieved the above image of women through her multi-dimensional characterization, decked with irony. |Theses collection|Writers/feminist/Buchi Emecheta/womanhood/chauvinism.*||||||Oladunni, Olufemi Ajayi|M|Analysis of resourse-use effiiency in tobacco-food crops farming system of oyo state, nigeria||||||Ph.D. Agricultural Economics|Oni, S.A. // Fabiyi, Y.L.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,  Agricultural Economics|1995|||OAU|||||xvii, 166p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

To do this, the primary data for the study were collected from tobacco and non-tobacco farmers through a multi-stage stratified random sampling technique based on farm size and the farming system. Cross-sectional data were collected to include the input and output rat and other socio- economic variables that affect directly or indirectly the output of the agricultural enterprise. The data were analyzed using the production function and budgetary analysis techniques. The Corrected Ordinary Least Square (COLS) method was used to determine the closeness of the to the production frontier zone. The result revealed that a typical tobacco farmer devoted an average of 4.47 hectares to tobacco and 4.62 hectares to foodcrops. This shows that while the tobacco farmers pursue the goal of satisfying their cash requirements in the cultivation of tobacco, the goal of food self sufficiency was not left behind. The food-crops produced include yam, cassava, maize, sorghum and vegetable crops. The result also revealed that the returns to management by the non-tobacco farmers was =N=1107.38 per hectare of farmland cultivated while tobacco farmers made =N=5412.82 as returns to management. This shows that it is more profitable to combine a cashcrop, in this case tobacco, with other foodcrops than to cultivate only foodcrops. Also, a small scale farmer had as much as =N=5,815.25 per hectare as returns to management compared with a large-scale farmer of =N=4833.34 per hectare of cultivated farmland. In terms of efficiency of resource-use, it was observed that most of the resources were over-utilised since their marginal value products (MVP) were less than their respective factor costs. The extent of this was more among non-tobacco farmers and the large-scale farmers. Therefore, profits can be enhanced by making necessary adjustments in the present levels of resource-use given the prevailing price conditions and the levels of the stock of the resources. The technical efficiency ratios revealed that the non- tobacco farmers had an average of 49 percent while the tobacco farmers had 58 percent. It was found out that the technical efficiency of the tobacco farmers was significantly greater than that of the non-tobacco farmers. Also, the technical efficiency ratios show that small- scale farmers were more technically efficient in resource utilisation than the large-scale farmers. |Theses collection|Tabacco-foodcrop farming system/cashcrop/small scale farmer.*||||||Olajide, Yetunde Folashade|F|Effects of the seepage of some agrochemicals on cichid and clarid fishes inhabiting the obafemi awolowo university teaching hospital and research farm behaviour||||||M.Sc.

During the period of study, structured questionnaires were administered to the head of the various units in the Teaching and Research farm to obtain information on the type of agrochemicals in use on the farm.Water and fish samples were also collected fortnightly from the reservoir. Physico-chemical parameters of water monitored during the-period include the pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, alkalinity and total hardness. The ionic component of water samples and fish fillet collected during the period was also monitored. The proximate composition of the fish fillet as well as that of the stomach content samples were also analysed during the period.Investigation revealed that during the last five years, twenty-one agrochemicals broadly classified into four groups had been in use in the various units on the Teaching and Research farm. The agrochemicals included two fungicides, eleven herbicides, four insecticides and four fertilizers. The questionnaires however showed that the potential for pollution is minimal due to the minimal and irregular usage of these agrochemicals on the farm.Analyses of the physico-chemical parameters of the water samples showed that the water collected from the two sampling sites were more or less homogenous and very poor in nutrient. Sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium were the major cations in the water body while ammonium, sulphate, nitrate, chloride and silicate were the major anions. (Trewavas Orechomis), niloticus (Trewavas) and Tilapia zillii (Gervais) were the members of the family Cichlidae caught, in the reservoir during the period of study. Only one member of the family Clariid (Burchell) was caught during the same period. The study revealed the preponderance Sarotherodon galilaeus specimens over all the other fish species in the reservoir.The abundance of fry observed during the period of study showed that fish species were thriving in the reservoir.

Four faults and four seismic horizons at depths of 1300m, 1800m, 2200m and 2900m were picked. The seismic horizons divide the study area into five layers. Layer -1 is Benin formation. Layers - 2, -3 and -4 fall within Agbada Formation while layer -5 corresponds to the Akata Formation. Layer -1 has a thickness of 1300m and interval velocity ranging from 1965m/s to 2090m/s. Layer -2 has a thickness range of 400m to 610m and an interval velocity ranging from 2365m/s to 2748m/s. Layer -3 posseses a thickness of between 320m to 570m with an interval velocity of 2503m/s to 3232m/s. This layer constitutes the hydrocarbon reservoir in the study area. The thickness of layer -4 varies from 375m to-750m and its interval velocity ranges from 2567m/s to 3348m/s. Layer-5 extends from a depth of about 2900m downwards. Qualitative interpretation of the induction electrical logs revealed the presence of hydrocarbon in eight separate sands intercalating with shales within the reservoir. Quantitative interpretation of the reservoir zone showed that shale content varies from 1% to 47%, porosity ranges from 17% to 21% while the hydrocarbon saturation ranges from 70% to 95%. The hydrocarbon moveability index ranges from 0.14 to 0.68 implying that the reservoir contain movable hydrocarbon. Seismic velocity - porosity - shale content mathematical relations were generated and used to predict the porosity and shale content distribution of the reservoir. The produced porosity and shale content maps revealed that porosity varies from 15% to 21% while shale content by volume ranges from 3% to 31% in the reservoir.The Isochron map of the reservoir revealed a rollover anticlinal structure while the isopach map revealed a southwestern dip of the reservoir respectively. The interval velocity, wave slowness and fluid velocity maps were used to describe the reservoir variability and to delimit the hydrocarbon bearing zones in the area. On the basis of this study, zones with interval  shaleanging from 2750m/s to 2900m/s, wave slowness of between 350s/m and 370s/m and fluid velocity ranging from 1300m/s to 1600m/s have been designated as hydrocarbon bearing zones. The results of the interval velocity, wave slowness and fluid velocity maps have good agreement. The hydrocarbon reserve estimate in the area was found to be 3.93x108m3. Two wells have been recommended for drilling in the delineated hydrocarbon bearing zones in the study area. |Theses collection| seismic sections/borehole logs/ hydrocarbon/reservoir/shale/*||||||Yesufu, Thomas Kokumo|M|Development of a novel technique in the implementation of cryptographic systems||||||M.Sc.

This work presents a new technique which employs the knowledge of chaos in generating the key used in the implementation of an unconditionally and provably secure cryptographic system.A known analog chaotic circuit from the Chua's Circuit Family (CCF) was chosen and its digital hardware implementation carried out to serve as a cryptographic key generator. A secure transmission of a 16kbps data using the cryptographic system was carried out. In addition, a computer simulation of the system was carried out.It was found that only two out of the four devices in the analog chaotic circuit used are necessary for the key generation. The digital hardware implementation of the system shows that the key, which is both transportable and reproducible, can be readily deleted or changed as the need arises. The timing diagram of the system shows that, at a clock rate of 128kHz, the bit rate of the key is 16kbps. The performance evaluation of the system shows that there is a marked difference between the encrypted data and the original data due to the chaotic nature of the Lissajous figure obtained from both. Moreover, the statistical tests on the cryptographic key stream shows that it is uniformly distributed and chaotic. It is, therefore envisaged that this technique will bring about the easy application of chaos in the implementation of cryptographic systems for a modern communications environment.|Theses Collection|analog chaotic circuit/digital hardware implementation/timing diagram/ modern communications environment*||||||Evoh, Chijioke Josiah|M|International politics of environmental protection||||||M.Sc., International relations|Oyesola, O.P.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, International Relations|1994 |||OAU|||||vii, 225p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The judicial decisions were examined in the context of the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions. Books and articles on the courts and general comments on judicial performance constitute the secondary source of information.The study revealed that although in pre-colonial "Nigeria", there was no judicial review of governmental action, as we understand it today, there was some form of constitutionalism. with the advent of the colonial power, English-type legal system was imported into Nigeria, as a potent instrument of consolidating and legitimising colonial rule. As was to be expected,it was difficult under the new dispensation to question the exercise of governmental power in court. The courts, were, however, occasionally assertive in the exercise of their power against the executive.Judicial review is now well established in the country. However, there is as yet no coherent theory of evaluation of the judicial role. The study argued that judicial decision-making is a judicial and a political act and that the Constitution is a legal as well as a political document. These facts were apparently not lost on the Nigerian courts as their liberal approach to constitutional interpretation clearly demonstrates. The same liberalism permeates their attitude to the procedural and factual elements of constitutional adjudication. As shown in chapter seven, they have not allowed technicalities of law to defeat the end of justice, A similar streak of liberalism is discernible in their application of the law of remedies.Under the military administrations while some judges have meekly succumbed to ouster clauses in some decrees, others have insisted that they can inquire into whetherthere had been compliance by executive acts with the provisions of enabling decrees, especially where the liberty of the individual is concernedThe conclusion showed that the supreme Court is gradually but steadily charting the course of a truly Nigerian Constitutional jurisprudence, This is evident in the court's disposition to decide 'hard cases' debito justiciae and interpret the constitution in the light of the peculiar realities of the Nigerian situation The need to consolidate this trend and make the legal process serve the interest of the common man were seen as the greatest challenge now facing the judiciary of constitutionalism. with the advent of the colonial power, English-type legal system was imported into Nigeria, as a potent instrument of consolidating and legitimising colonial rule.

Plant protein sources have been found attractive both in cost and availability. The process of germination has been shown to improve the nutrient characteristics of grains, consequently, it was applied in this study to develop a weaning food with low water holding capacity, low viscosity and increased nutrient density.Experiments were conducted to formulate a weaning food from germinated grains. Germination of period of 72 and 48 hours were applied for the cereals and legume respectively. The germinated grains were dried at a temperature not exceeding 45C, milled and formulated as follows - corn (60%), rice (20%), soybean (15%) and defatted sesame (5%). Defatted sesame flour was added to supply methionine and cystein. The product was evaluated for proximate composition, physico-chemical properties, animal feeding trials and amino acid analysis. The data obtained were compared with those of cerelac and nutrend as control diets.The protein, fat, ash and carbohydrate contents of the germinated diet were 17.00%%, 8.45%, 1.63% and 66.81% respectively. The diet was not significantly different (P>7 0.05) from the controls in terms of physico-chemical properties, such as water holding capacity, swelling capacity and viscosity but significantly different (P<0.05) from the ungerminated diet. The bioassay parameters; protein efficiency ratio (PER) and net protein ratio (NPR) were not significantly different (P > 0.05) from those of the control diets. However, the essential amino acid level of the germinated diet was found to be superior to that of the ungerminated diet.The results from this study have shown that germination of grains offer a good potential in the formulation of weaning foods and will go a long way in helping towards the eradication of protein energy malnutrition in infants.|Theses Collection|germination/malnutrition/methionine/nutrients/protein efficiency ratio (PER)  *||||||Olojo, Oluwarotimi Odunayo|M|Studies on aquation of some haklopentacy anocobaltate (III) complexes and their reductons by titanium(III) in acidic aqueous media.||||||M.Sc., Chemistry|Ojo, J.F.// Olubuyide,O.A.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Chemistry|1994|||OAU|||||xv, 111p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The concentration of these nations' economic activities anti infrastructure amenities in few cities resulted in the rapid urbanisation and unprecedented immigration of these areas with the attendant social ills such as lack of housing for the migrants.The Nigerian government. respond to arrest the housing crisis by implementing several housing programmes but without at the same time tackling rural poverty and neglect which are the causes of migrations. These strategies have failed to curb housing shortages because of their comprehensive "top-downsupply-driven nature.But, while the official responses failed dismally, the urban poor have attempted to resolve the housing problems by establishing their own shelter and.settlements on the fringes of the burgeoning cities, The housing conditions of these areas, like the, slums, are deplorable due to the fear of eviction and the temporary nature of tenure. Against: this backdrop, what is needed is to examine carefully this resourcefulness and the problems inhibiting the improvement of these areas and improve on this housing initiative. This will improve the welfare of the residents end national housing stock at minimum costs.Mkpologwu, a squatter settlement in Enugu, has been carefully chosen for this case study, which is based on the author's original data, The objectives of the study are to access the pausing needs and the housing and environmental. conditions of the residents and to suggest policy recommendation  to improve its conditions among others. To achieve these, secondary data were collected from some relevant authorities like Town Planning, survery and Lands Divisions among others. For ease of analysis, the coded systematic random sampling was applied to administer questionaires  to 353 household heads out of the estimated 521 households.The findings were analysed  and second, statistically using bivariate and multivariate techniques. Results are also shown on tables, graphs and plates.The findings of the study are typical of the case than general, but there is,every reason to suggest that the issues involved are more national than Local. Amongst the findings ere that immigation is caused by rural neglect and poverty; national housing policies have been to the disfavour of the urban poor;  squatter settlements are the outcome of housing shortages for the urban migrants; and poor housing conditions of squatter areas areamenable to upgrading programmes.Policy recommendations have been tailored to reflect these observations. These are two sets - micro and macro. The first set deals with the strategies to ameliorate the housing conditions of Mkpologwu while the second are meant to effect institutional changes in the national development and housing strategies. These findings and recommendations will, no doubt, be of immense benefit to other inquiries of this nature in Nigeria and elsewhere.|Theses Collection|Infrastructure amenities/urbanisation/immigration/housing programmes/ *||||||Ilesanmi, Olapade Rufus Sunday|M|Some pharmacological responses of the rat fundus and duodenum during food restriction||||||M.Phil, Pharmacology|Dixon,P.A.F.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,Pharmacology|1994|||OAU|||||ix, 83p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

This work attempts to separate benzene, toluene, xylene (BTX), which are important feedstocks of the petrochemical industry, present in these condensates. Petroleum liquid condensate from Mobil's Inim 8B well, light naphtha, heavy naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking unit (F.C.C.U) effluent were fractionated in a sieve plate column into four fractions. The cuts were in the temperature ranges of 0C-60C, 60C-80C, 80C-120C and >120C (bottoms). The fractions were then subjected to the Fluorescent Indicator Adsorption (F.I.A) analysis to determine the relative percent aromatics in each of the cuts. The F.I.A analysis result for the 80C-120C cut, which constitute the BTX 'heartcut' gave percent aromatics of 9.45, 9.05, 23.37 and 52.05 for the liquid. condensate, light naphtha, heavy naphtha and F.C.C.0 effluent respectively.The only fraction (80C-120C) of the liquid condensate containing all the required components, benzene, toluene and xylene, was used in the separation of BTX by the adsorption-desorption process. Two adsorbent types - silica gel and activated magnesium silicate, and three groups of solvents - alkyl halides, alcohols and a nitrile compound, were employed as desorbents. The combination of silica gel -trichloromethane was found to be effective for BTX separation in the 80C - 120C cut of the liquid condensate.

A total of five faults and four seismic horizons at depth of 1700m, 2650m, 3200m and 3500m respectively were picked.These horizons divide the study area into five different layers.The isodepth maps of layers 1,2,3 and 4 show a general increase in thickness from North to South in the study area. The isodepth and isochron maps show Monoclinal structure in the upper part of the study area to a depth of 2700m. Below this depth a hanging wall structure which traps hydrocarbon was delineated. The isovelocity maps were used to describe the velocity distribution and also to delimit the hydrocarbon zone in the area.The qualitative interpretation of the lithologic logs (Gamma-Ray and SP) and the electrical resistivity logs (short normal and induction) revealed five broad zones designated as zones A,B,C,D and E for the two wells (well 1 and well 1-S). A sixth additional zone designated F occurs in well 1 - S. It has been noted that the corresponding zones in both wells have the same characteristics. Zone A lies between 1750m and 2050m in well 1, and 1640m and 2060m in well 1-S. It consists of an intercalation of shale and sand and is water bearing. Zone B lies between 2120m and 2480m in well 1, and 2100m and 2500m in well 1 - S. Zone B is sand. The sands contain water. Zone C is between 2750m and 3050m in well 1, and 2550m and 3000m in well 1 - S.The zone is Shaly sand. It is water bearing. Zone D lies between a depth of 3120m and 3450m in well 1, and 310Om and 336Om in well 1 - S. The  zone is shale. It acts as cap for zone E. Zone E is between 35OOm and 3690m in well 1, and 354Om and 36OOm in well 1 - S. The Zone is sandy shale. The sand is hydrocarbon-bearing. Zone F is between 3625m3690m and exists in well 1 - S only. The Zone is an interbed of sand and shale. The sand contains hydrocarbon.Furthermore, the results of compaction studies showed that action varies with mean depth in the area. The wave slowness of the ineated reservoir showed that low values wave slowness between 240- 290 us/m can be interpreted as representing non-porous and therefore compacted zones while zones with high value wave slowness between 300 and 340 us/m represent porous and therefore non-compacted .The trend obtained from compaction curves provided information e overpressure zones in the area.

Geological mapping of the study area was undertaken in order to determine the main rock types. Water samples were collected from hand dug wells, boreholes and surface waters in seven localities and were analysed in the laboratory for their chemical constituents. The results obtained from the determination of the physico-chemical parameters were subjected to various statistical tests and plots. This was to test and attempt to explain the spatia-temporal variations in water quality parameters in relation to the bedrock types.The results of ANOVA among groundwater quality samples on the different bedrock units showed that most of the values were not significantly different among the parameters considered for the two seasons investigated. Except for the physical parameters of wells, colour, chloride and silica, all the other parameters were not significantly different. The differences between some of the groundwater quality and surface water quality samples were found to be significant using the student `t' test. The following parameters shows significant differences between the two types of water considered: colour, dissolved solids, total solids, total hardness, calcium, sodium, silica, nitrate and iron at P< 0.001 confidence level while the other parameters were not significant. The same test on the two sets of samples during rain and dry seasons shows that only manganese is significantly different at 0.01 confidence level while the other parameters show no significant difference. The overall mean nitrate level of (0.42  0.46) mg/1 and mean sulphate and chloride level (21.7  16.2) mg/l, (56.2  41.6) mg/1 respectively indicate that the groundwater in the area of study to be wholesome and potable due to the relatively low concentrations of chlorides, sulphates, and nitrates in almost all the entire groundwater samples. The correlation coefficients revealed a positive relationship between most of the ions analysed for. The highest `r' value of 0.8211 was between magnesium and conductivity while the lowest `r' value of 0.0331 was between sodium and nitrate.The study reflects a fairly distinct pattern between water quality and the bedrock geology. However, the statistical tests seem to provide better correlation between groundwater quality and bedrock types than chemical plots irrespective of anthropogenic influences. It is thus recommended that geochemical analysis of the overburden could be carried out to obtain a better correlation between water quality and the underlying bedrock geology.|Theses Collection|physico-chemical quality/Geological mapping / ANOVA*||||||Imasogie, Benjamin Iyalekhuosa|M|Development and cahracterisation of isothermally heat-trreated nodular cast irons||||||PhD., Met. and Matls.

The microstructural and mechanical properties of ferritic, ferritic-pearlitic, pearlitic and bainitic grades of these irons were characterized and compared.The results obtained indicate that up to 92% nodularity could be obtained by using calcium based compounds, compared with 95% for Ca-Mg mixture and 97% using magnesium-ferrosilicon. Their as-cast mechanical properties were also comparable. It was established that, compared to magnesium, calcium-treated nodular irons show little or no susceptibility to chilling and formation of secondary phases such as phosphide eutectic and lediburite. The irons produced displayed good  response to the different applied heat-treatment schedules, asevidenced from their microstructures and mechanical properties, resulting thereof.

Three tests --Piaget-Styled-Instrument (PSI), Test in Inorganic Chemistry Trivial Nomenclature (TITN), and Test in Inorganic Chemistry IUPAC Nomenclature (TIIN) were administered one after the other to the subjects.Stratified-random-sampling method was used in the selection of the two hundred and ninety (one hundred and forty-five males and one hundred and forty-five females) subjects, from ten schools in six local government areas of Kogi State. The ages of the Senior Secondary School Chemistry students ranged from fourteen to twenty-five years. The data was anallysed using percentages correlation coefficient t-test the significant level gas put at 0.05. The results from the study showed that the percentage of Chemistry students of SSS III still operating at concrete operational level was 87.24% while students operating at formal operational level was 12.76%. Both male and female students operating at formal operational level performed better in the Inorganic Chemistry nomenclature tests than students operating at concrete operational level.

The objectives of the study includes a determination of the loans given in terms of geographical spread, group and individual; an assessment of the impact of the scheme on income, savings and expenditure of rural women; and a comparison of the rates of loan repayment among beneficiaries in the three states. Others objectives include analysis of factors influencing loan repayment under the scheme, and the identification of the constraints facing the scheme in order to provide the framework for its improvement.The data used for this study were derived from primary and secondary sources. The primary data were obtained with the aid of structured questionnaire administered on 200 loan beneficiaries selected from Nine UBA branches in the states. (These include Akure, Oke-Igbo, Ilara-Mokin,; Ibadan Central, Molete, Oyo; Oyan Osu and Imesi-Ile). The respondents were chosen through a stratified random sampling technique in which loan types and Bank Branches were used as strata. The secondary data obtained from the bank's records contained information on Loans issued, repaid and interest charges. Analytical techniques employed include descriptive statistics and ordinary least squares regression method. A multiple regression model of varying polynomial degrees were used in estimating the determinants of loan repayment among beneficiaries. The analysis of credit granted under the scheme in the states showed that a total of 880 loans valued at N3.45m were received by beneficiaries for the period of 1988-1991. The scheme covered 72 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in the three states. Variations were observed in the determination of loan repayment in the surveyed states. The net income after credit use and number of years of formal education are major determinants of loan repayment in Ondo state. In Osun state the number of years of formal education, age of respondents and years of enterprise experience were entified as the major determinants of loan repayment whereas in Oyo state, net income after credit use and years of project experience were the major determinants of loan repayment. On the aggregate therefore the major loan repayment determinants identified were net income after credit use and age of beneficiaries. The empirical results of the loan repayment analysis showed that the scheme has not performed very well. The average rate of loan repayment was about 46% although there were slight variations among the states.The impact of the scheme on the living standards of beneficiaries was assessed by considering their savings, income and expenditure levels before and after loan acquisition. The results showed that the beneficiaries had substantial increase in the parameters examined. The most critical constraints confronting the scheme were high interest rates charged on loans and the rising cost of inputs. Remedial measures to mitigate the shortcomings of the scheme include interest rate reduction and provision of facilities to enhance loan recovery.|Theses Collection|empirical evaluation/ UBA/ Local Government Areas (LGAs) *||||||Oyedele, Victoria Iyabode|F|An analysis of investigative and confirmatory laboratory approaches to biology instruction in senior secondary schools.||||||M.A.Ed., Curriculum studies|Ehindero, O.J.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Curriculum Studies|1994|||OAU|||||xi,86p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Among factors that have been blamed for the selection of resistant strains are subinhibitory blood levels and significant amounts of antibiotic left unabsorbed in the gut. These factors may arise when products of poor bioavailability are used in the treatment of infections.Six samples of tetracycline and five of ampicillin capsules, all with a 250mg label claim, were purchased from hospitals, community pharmacies, patent medicine shops and road-side stalls in Ile-Ife. The capsules were subjected to tests for weight uniformity, microbiological assay, breakdown products and dissolution characteristics. Comparative bioavailability studies employing healthy male volunteer subjects were carried out in which samples obtained from manufacturers and, in the case of ampicillin, a solution served as reference standards. Bioavailability was estimated from urinary excretion data and statistical analysis of  bioavailability parameters was carried out by means of Wilcoxon's signed rank test and analysis of variance.All the tetracycline and four of the ampicillin capsule samples purchased in Ile-Ife were found to be of of sub-standard quality. This poor quality resulted in bioavailability problems in four of the eight products used in the comparative bioavailabillity study. There was significant correlation between data obtained in the bioavailability and dissolution tests for both antibiotics. Inter-individual variation was high with both drugs and statistically significant with tetracycline. The extent of absorption of tetracycline from capsules in four of the five test subjects was higher than that documented by-previous workers.The study revealed that ampicillin and tetracycline bioavailability problems are being routinely dispensed in Ile-Ife.

Ifewara and Aye-Oba) in South Western Nigeria.These were separated into three main parts - peel, pulp and core --, dried, ground into flour and analysed for proximate composition, minerals and vitamin C using the offical methods of Association of official Analytical Chemists and American Association of Cereal Chemists. Total. starch of breadfruit was determined by enzymic method while toxicants were analysed by phytochemical screening and colorimetric methods. The physicochemical properties of starch, the total free sugar components and total reducing sugars were evaluated using centrifuge, paper chromatography and colorimetric methods. The rate of decomposition of breadfruit was determined by analysing the pulp for total. free sugars produced at specific time intervals using Anthrone method.The chemical composition of breadfruit showed that the core had the highest values of moisture (83.8 - 88.3%), ash (5.7 - 8.1%), protein (7.7 - 14.7%), fat (2.9 - 3.6%), crude fibre (16.4 - 19.2%), total free sugars (5.0%), total reducing sugars (2.4%) and the least for total carbohydrate, starch and vitamin C. The pulp had the greatest values for carbohydrate (89.5 - 92.2%), starch (72.0 -- 77.6%) and least for moisture, ash, protein, fat and crude fibre. The peel had the highest level of vitamin 0 (0.07%) and least for total. free sugars and tote l reducing augers. The proximate composition of breadfruit showed no significant differences between trees nor with location at P< 0.01 . The mineral components Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu, Fe, Cd, Na, K and P were relatively high compared to some of the conventional carbohydrate sources. Potassium values were higher than other minerals is in all the three parts with the core value (3.64%) being other highest. The fruits stored in water and aaucous fo:rmaldehyd~ solution were better preserved than those kept in the refrigerator and room temperature. Phytochemical screening Indicated presence of alkaloids and tannins and the absence of saponins, phlohatannins, anthra quinones and cyanide in all the three parts. Tannin level was highest in peel (0,07%) and lowest in core (0.02%). The swelling and solubility of the isolated starch at the maximum pasting temperature (95C), were 3,827% and 24.2% respectively. Intinsic viscosity was 2.95 cS. Amylose content was highest in starch isolated from freeze those dried samples (24.8%) and least in starch from those dried at 80oC (22.6%).

This was with a view to determining the communication practices and therefore the communication features that are characteristic of particular school climates.Forty-four secondary schools were purposively selected as the sample for the study. Two structured questionnaires were designed to collect pertinent data. One was the Organizational Climate Description Questionnaire (OCDQ) designed to measure organizational climate and classify the sample schools into climate types. The other was the Communication Practices Questionnaire (CPQ,) designed to measure the communication practices that go on in the schools. The Teachers in the sample schools were randomly selected as the subjects to respond to the questionnaires. The Pearson's Product- Moment correlation Analysis was employed to find out the relationship between the variables of organizational climate and communication practices in their aggregate and separate forms. Results obtained from data analysis revealed that the aggregate and separate forms of organizational climate and communication practices are related in various degrees, both positively and negatively. With the resulting relationships, each of the identified climate types was separately described based on the projected communication features. The latter were rated low, average and high. Thus the results further revealed that an open school climate is characterized by such practices that constitute low communication channels, high communication feedback, low communication with the transactional environment and low communication barriers.A controlled school climate is separately characterized by such practices that constitute average communication channels and feedback, low communication with the transactional environment and high communication barriers.

In addition, twenty-seven recent river sediment samples from Imo, Kwa Ibo, Cross and Calabar rivers were also examined using standard sedimentological and stratigraphical methods which included systematic sample description as well as geophysical log, grain size, heavy mineral and clay mineral analyses.The study was ultimately aimed at contributing to the existing knowledge of the stratigraphy and sedimentology of the Niger Delta and thus facilitating more fruitful exploration for hydrocarbons in the delta. Based on Iithologic characteristics, two informal lithostratigraphic units, A and B, which respectively correspond to the lower and upper units of the Agbada Formation, were distinguished in the four main boreholes.Geophysical log, clay mineral, grain size and sand percentage analyses show that in the four main boreholes, sediments were deposited in environments that vary from the fluviomarine lower coastal plain to the marine.  Textural characteristics suggest that the sediments of Obeakpu-6 and Korokoro-10 boreholes were transported over a longer distance than those of Etc-1 and Utapate South-1. Heavy mineral analysis permitted the recognition of a factor (the hvanite-Staurolite factor) for distinguishing the two ancient river systems contributing sediments to the Niger Delta during most of the Tertiary, the Cross and the Niger-Benue River syvstems. Heavy mineral and clay mineral analyses show that the sediments of Obeakpu-6 and Korokoro-10 boreholes were derived largely from the Abakaliki Fold Belt as well as the Adamawa-Sarduana Massif and/or the Oban Massif, while those of Ete-1 and Utapate South-1 boreholes were largely sourced from the Oban Massif and the Calabar Flank. The preponderance of kaolinite in their clay mineral suites indicates that the sediments in the four main boreholes were generated under a warm and humid tropical climate in an environment of steep slopes and high topographic relief.|Theses Collection|lithostratigraphic characteristics/ depositional environments/ transport history/ provenance*||||||Ajelabi, Olufunmilola Bola|F|Removal of heavy metals from industrial wastewaters using natural adsorbents||||||M.Sc., Chemistry|Asubiojo, F.O.I||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Chemistry|1994||| OAU|||||xvi,120p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

In this study, the effectiveness of cheap, readily available natural materials as adsorbents of heavy metals from industrial wastewaters was investigated. Natural materials investigated include bagasse, paddy husk, corn cob, wheat bran, peanut skin and human hair.Two modes of removal were carried out. In one set of experiments, mixed standard solutions of some heavy metals and also effluents from different industries were run through columns packed with natural adsorbents. In the other set, the mixed standard solutions and the effluents were, simply agitated with known weights of the natural adsorbents. Heavy metal concentrations of the mixed standard solutions and the industrial effluents were determined before and after contact with the natural adsorbents using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS). Parameters such as column height, substrate weight, particle size of the substrate and the pH of the substrate in solution were varied to obtain optimum conditions for heavy metal removal. Virtually all the materials were found to be good scavengers of heavy metals, as good if not better than some of the conventional, expensive commercial materials such as ion-exchange resin currently in use for wastewater treatment. The mechanism of removal is proposed to be similar to ion-exchange resins and adsorption. The adsorption capacities of the natural adsorbents vary from one heavy metal to another. Based on the overall mean percentage removal of heavy metals (87.6 to 92.2%), the heavy metal adsorbing capacity of the natural adsorbents is of the following order: Corn cob > paddy husk > peanut skin > human hair > wheat bran > bagasse. in terms of weight of heavy metal adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent, the efficiency of heavy metal scavenging is of the following order: Bagasse and human hair > corn cob and peanut skin > wheat bran > paddy husk. Efficiency of heavy metal removal by the natural adsorbents increases with column height and decreases with particle size of adsorbent and residual heavy metal concentration in the effluent. Development of this method is recommended as an efficient and cost-effective method for wastewater treatment.|Theses Collection|Pollutants/public waterways/Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS)/ion-exchange resin/natural adsorbents/heavy metal  *||||||Adeyemi, Kehinde Oluseye|M|Interpretation of seismic reflection data over moonstone-3, offshore Niger Delta||||||M.Sc., Geophysics|Olorunniwo,M.A.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Geophysics|1994||| OAU|||||xiii, 249p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

These seismic horizons divide the study area into five layers. The Dix technique of interval velocity and depth inversion was used in computing the interval velocities and depths to each horizon. The computed interval velocities in horizon one range from 1944 - 2131 m/s, while the depth values range from 1320 - 1556 m.In horizon two interval velocities range from 2279-2955 m/s while the depth values range from 1492 - 1761 m. In horizon three interval velocities range from 2363 - 3174 m/s while the depth values range from 1787 - 2107 m and in horizon four interval velocities range from 2340 - 3489 m/s while depth values range from 2243 - 2733 in. Results show a general increase of interval velocity with depth as well as lateral velocity inhomogeneity . This may be due to the pattern of faulting in the area and to some extent on facies changes.Seismic structural maps such as isochrons, isovelocities and isopachs were prepared from the parameters of each layer. The isochron isopach maps have revealed roll- over anticlinal structures in the area. The isovelocity maps were used to describe the velocity distribution over the study area.In addition to the growth-fault-generated anticlinal structures revealed by the structural maps, stratigraphic traps such as Facies-change trap and crestal accumulations below mature erosional surfaces were also recognized on the seismic sections. These crestal accumulations represent the main trapping mechanism for hydrocarbon in the study area and are presented as strong reflection events on the seismic sections.The qualitative and quantitative interpretation of the borehole data have revealed four broad zones represented by zones A, C and D respectively. The borehole data was correlated with the surface seismic sections and the four zones were recognized. Zone A is made up of fresh water/minor oil and gas. Zone B is made up of shale acting as a cap rock over zone C which is hydrocarbon bearing. Zone D is dominantly salt water bearing.Waveslowness and sand ratio analysis of the sand-shale columns revealed that waveslowness/sand ratio were higher within the amplitude map of the sand body and lower outside of it.|Theses Collection|Hydrocarbon/inhomogeneity/seismic structural maps/isochron/isopach/isovelocities/anticlinal structures/waveslowness/crestal accumulations*||||||Obi, Olutayo Olumide|M|The effect of nutrition and health interventions in rural poultry production in Osun state.||||||M.Sc., Animal science|Sonaiya, E.B.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Animal Science|1994||| OAU|||||x, 76p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The average price of a mature cock was N 79, while hens and growers cost N 58 and N 29, respectively. The farmers were willing to pay N 4.30 per bird for vaccination against Newcastle disease and N 6.70 per Kilogram of compounded feed. Gross margin estimation shows that the farmers realize a positive margin of N 4.50 from the sale of growers at 3 months of age and N9.00 and N 30.00 on hens and cocks, respectively, when sold at 6 months of age.The second study was conducted on-farm to study the effect of offering supplements (commercial growers mash) and vaccination against Newcastle disease on the productivity of scavenging village chickens. The treatments were villages in. which supplementation, vaccination, a combination of supplementation and vaccination were offered. The control was the village in which no experimental supplement or vaccination was offered to the scavenging birds. Data were collected on body weight changes, apparent average supplemental feed intake, flock size, number of eggs laid, number of chicks hatched, and number of chicks surviving at 2 , 4 , 6 and 8 weeks. The data collected was analyzed for means, standard deviations and percentages. The means were compared and separated using one-way analysis of variance and Duncans New multiple range test.The results indicate a drop in average apparent daily intake (g/bird) of the experimental supplements after the first period for the different groups except the cocks whose consumption fluctuated down the periods. The average daily weight gain (g/bird/day) fluctuated over time for birds in all treatments. The vaccination treatment had the highest average daily gain of 2.78 g/bird/day but this was not significantly different from other treatments. The average clutch sizes of hens in both supplementation and supplementation + vaccination treatments (9.26 and 8.78 eggs) were significantly higher than those in the vaccination and control treatments (6.70 and 6.33 eggs). The overall average clutch size was 8.36 eggs while the average number of chicks hatched was 6.08 a hatchability of 72.7%. Mortality was highest in the control treatment (65.0%).Supplementing 50% of the calculated requirements of scavenging chickens with commercial growers mash and timely vaccination against Newcastle disease improved the productivity and the gross margins obtainable from rural chicken production system.|Theses Collection|commercial growers mash/vaccination against Newcastle disease*||||||Oladimeji, Hakeem Olawale|M|Bioactivity-guided fractionation of acalyphia wilkesiana.||||||M.Sc., Pharmaceutical Chemistry|Olugbade, T.A.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Pharmaceutical chemistry|1996||| OAU|||||xi, 90p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Members of this genus are used extensively in traditional medicine in various cultures (African, Oriental, Indian, European and Oceanian) to treat a number of infections including skin fungal infections, respiratory disorders and gastrointestinal infections.In this work, six Acalypha species namely A.,ciliata, A. indica, A. hispida and A,. wilkesiana varieties (Red, Golden-yellow and Lace varieties) were screened for antimicrobial properties and brine shrimp toxicity. Only A. ciliata, a weed, demonstrated LD50  200ppm in the brine shrimp assay. The ornamental plants, A. hispida and the three varieties of A. wilkesiana demonstrated significant antibacterial activities against E. coli, S. aurens, B. subtilis and Ps. aeruginosa. Only A. hispida and the red Acalypha showed significant anticandidal (C. pseudotropicalis) activity as well. Hence, one of these two, the red Acalypha was selected for detailed studies. The red Acalypha has been specifically reported to he used extensively in the treatment of bacterial and skin fungal infections like Pityriasis versicolor, Impetigo contagiosa and Tinea versicolor in traditional herbal medicine in Nigeria.Studies involving solvent-partitioning of the aqueous ethanolic extract located antimicrobial activity in the butanol fraction.Subsequent bioactivity directed this fraction successively on sephadex LH-20 and polyamide 6S column revealed the antibacterial principles as a mixture of two polyphenols. Minimum effort liquid chromatography of' the mixture on silica resolved the mixture into two compounds which were identified using spectroscopic methods, one as cofilagin and the other tentatively identified as geraniin. Both compounds isolated demonstrated antimicrobial activities against the five test organisms.While corilagin and geraniin have been previously reported from other sources, the antimicrobial properties of these ellagitannins have not been hitherto reported. Although corilagin is well known to be an artefact resulting from in-process hydrolysis of geraniin, the natural occurrence of this tannin in red Acalypha was confirmed, in the present study, by its thin-layer chromatographic detection in fresh leaves.|Theses Collection|species /weeds and ornamental shrubs/gastrointestinal infections/A.,ciliata, A. indica, A. hispida and A,. wilkesiana/*||||||Agaie, Shuaibu Sulaiman|M|Relationship between learning styles and academic performance of nursing students in schools of nursing in Osun state||||||M.Sc.

Besides, it identifies the external dimensions of both the Eritrean nationalist movement and Ethiopia's responses to the insurgency.Primary data was obtained from interviews, personal communications with Eritrean and Ethiopian official representatives; and official reports and publications of the liberation fronts. The secondary sources include books and journal articles by academics, diplomats, journalists and reports of international news media. The study shows that, the Eritrean problem is rooted in material contradictions arising from the mutually opposing forces of Eritrean and imperial Ethiopian nationalism.lt however, shows that geo-political consideration played a great part in nurturing the seeds of the conflict. Moreover, internationalisation inheres In the logic of the national question once it assumes the dimension of a full-fledged national 1st conflict.Internationalisation occurs at two levels: (i) at the level of the warring parties, and (ii) at the level of the international society. Both parties to the conflict have to solicit external support while foreign states, regional and global actors are drawn into the conflict for varying objectives but mainly because of their vested interest in safeguarding those norms and principles of international relations which serve the end of regime and state security. Thus, while the Eritrean cause was generally isolated, Ethiopia attracted tremendous political, diplomatic and military support from the international community.The enquiry, however, reveals that the incidence of internationalisation is not unilinear as it responds to changes, in the conditions of the warring parties and developments in the external environment: Because of the persistence and explosiveness of the fighting, as well as the momentous changes in the international system, the Eritreans succeeded in breaking out of isolation, gaining, in the process, a considerable measure of recognition and support for their cause. As the position of the international community changed- from one of prolonged isolation to reconciliation, and, lately, to tacit encouragement, the Eritreans consummated their independence, thus overcoming the resilient normative and structural constraints which impede the creation of new states.|Theses Collection|internationalisation/warring parties/independence/Nationalism/diplomacy/foreign relations*||||||Nfah, Mary Baba|M|Design and implementation of recursive descent parser generator||||||M.Sc.

They are characterized by highlevel languages which cannot be directly executed by the computer. There was the need to translate such languages into machine executable instructions hence compilers became paramount. A compiler operates in phases each of which transforms the source program from one representation to another.This work is concerned with the syntax analysis phase, based on the recursive descent parsing technique. Table implementations of recursive descent parsers are common. The need to eliminate the use of a parsing table has been recognised, hence a solution approach to design and implement a directly executable parser from a grammar specification was provided by this work. A recursive grammar was and this formed the input to LL(1) grammar was specified the parser generator. The parser generator- was implemented using a set of recursive procedures with semantic actions embedded into the parsing procedures to automate the generation of output. A lexical analyzer was incorporated to extract tokens from the input source language. The output of the parser generator consist of the recognized constructs of the source language together with an intermediate representation in postfix polish notation. The number of times each nonterminal in the source language was called during the execution of program was also determined.Parsing procedures once built into a compiler are not easy to change because they are normally augmented with code that perform semantic analysis and code generation. Also grammars are sometimes updated to accommodate new or modified constructs. It is therefore desirable to have a way of updating a parser without affecting other compiler components. Rather than using the LL(1) table to build parsing procedures, the result of this work has been to automate the translation of a grammar into an intermediate form which can then serve as input to a code generator. The parser generated, is also flexible and efficient in its utilisation of time and memory space. It is easier to implement and excutes faster than a table driven parser.|Theses Collection|Programming languages/communication/syntax analysis phase/*||||||Ebune, Lydia Ntube|F|Evaluation and simulation of memory allocation schemes||||||M.Sc.

The recognition of this fact has led to a series of advancements in producing various memory management schemes to improve on operating systems.The various memory management techniques are used in managing the main memory of the computer, so that it can efficiently accommodate all the requested processes. Selection of a memory management schemes for a specific system depends upon the hardware design. Some of these factors have been used in the evaluation model to determine the efficiency of some schemes.These schemes were evaluated using an emulation of the memory environment of a computer system, with special attention to the components involved with memory management such as the Tasker, which simulates task execution by generating deallocation requests for random memory blocks, the Viewer that displays memory, the Memory which is structured into contiguous blocks of memory space and the freelist Manager which provides functions such as deallocation, block remapping and allocation of free space. The schemes were then simulated using these four components to determine their efficiency. the main program is called Memsim written in Pascal programming language.The results obtained indicated that no particular scheme is actually the best in satisfying all memory management requirements of proper utilization of memory, proper handling of internal and external fragmentation. The results show that, while some schemes are good in memory utilization, others are good in handling internal and external fragmentation. Optimal memory utilization with 56 processes running was 417792 bytes. When compared to the overall available memory of 524288 bytes of memory size, it was observed that only a memory space of 106496 bytes was left unused. The two schemes that had this amount of memory utilization were, dynamic allocation with relocation block unit-1024 and dynamic allocation without relocation block unit-1024. The lowest level of internal fragmentation was with the partition allocation with relocation and dynamic allocation with and without relocation block unit-1, with no internal fragmentation. The lowest level of external fragmentation with 56 running processes was indicated by dynamic-allocation with relocation block unit - 1024. From our results it was observed that having an hybrid memory allocation scheme (i.e. combining two allocation schemes, one that reduces internal fragmentation and one that properly utilizes memory space) will maximally utilize memory.|Theses Collection|operating systems/ memory management/ Pascal programming language*||||||Amujoyegbe, Bamidele Julius|M|Preliminary studies of yield system analysis in some selected cultivars of cowpea ( Vigna unguiculata , (L) Walp.)||||||M.Sc.

Walp) were evaluated in two seasons in 1991 at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Nineteen characters were analysed to quantify their variability and their effect on yield as expressed by the varieties in the test environments.The seedling traits emergence (E), emergence percentage (E%), emergence index (El), emergence rate index (ERI) and vigour index (VGX) were found to affect crop establishment and alter the maturity period. Among the phenological traits measured, only prolonged days to seed fill favoured increased grain yield.Seed weight {100 SOW), number of pods per plant (NPP), harvest index (HI) and threshing percentage (Thr.%) ranged between 7.50 - 18.00g, 17-57; 18.60 - 55.50% and 40.74 - 77.40%, respectively. The mean range for biomass (BM), seed growth rate (SCR), yield growth rate (YGR) and biomass growth rate (OCR) were 1604.54 - 3521.14 kg/ha; 8.28 - 39.91 kg/ha; 3.81 - 17.07 kg/ha and 17.09 - 40.50 kg/ha; respectively with the respective averages of 2613.78 kg/ha; 22.83 kg/ha 1.0.43 kg/ha and 29.51 kg/ha. The grain yield ranged from 343.52 kg/ha to 1559.9 kg/ha with the average: of 935.37 kg/ha. correlation coefficients of NPP, 100 SDW; Thr 7, BM, SGR, YGR, i',R and HI showed positive significance (0.404, 0.537, 0.479, 0.642, 0.926, 0.525 and 0.745 respectively) with grain yield. Grouping the traits into seedling, maturity days, yield components and yield outputs, emergence and E% showed respectively positive and negative direct and indirect effects on yield. Number of pods per plant, Thr 2, 100 SDW and YGR showed high direct positive effects (0.338, 0.34, 0.524 and 0.826 respectively) on yield. Days to seed fill also showed positive but non-significant direct effect (0.157) on grain yield. When the traits which showed superior direct effect on yield in each group were analysed, the path analysis indicated that YOR showed the most significant direct effect (0.900), follow d by 100 SDW (0.329). Twelve varieties: K-59, IAR 48W, IT86D-1010, IAR-48, K-39, IT85F-958,H-113-4, IT86D-880, OB89(5), IT87D-1629, IT86D-721 and IT85D-3577 were the highest yielders producing above 1000 kg/seed/ ha. Six of these varieties (K-59, IAR48W, IAR48, K-39, IT85F-958 and IT86D-1010) showed distinct superiority in yield, yield components and yield output traits. Low yielders, apart from showing inferior phenotypic performance, were late maturing. The alternative pathways through which cowpea achieve yield are: number of pods per plant, 100 SDW, The %. SGR, YGR, BM and BGR. The most important trait for indirect selection is the YGR because of its highest direct effect on yield. Prolonged growth duration is not favourable to cowpea grain yield unlike prolonged DSF.|Theses Collection|emergence (E)/ emergence percentage (E%)/ emergence index (El)/ emergence rate index (ERI)/ vigour index (VGX)/ Seed weight {100 SOW)/ number of pods per plant (NPP)/ harvest index (HI)/ threshing percentage (Thr.%)*||||||Coker, Akinwale Oladotun|M|The effects of high velocity gradients in water coagulation||||||M.Sc.

Any effort to substantially reduce this therefore becomes meaningful, laudable and one in the right direction. It is against this background that this study was under-taken to investigate the effects of high velocity gradient, G (intense rapid mixing) in water coagulation, with and without addition of coagulant.The typical raw water used for the study was obtained by damming a portion of the stream in front of the Civil Engineering Building at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. A 32-litre sample of the raw water was positioned ready for the run in a tank and using a calibrated high-shear stirrer, the water was subjected to selected levels of G-200, 500 and 800 per second for 2, 8, 16, 24 and 32 minutes. In cases where coagulant was used to supplement G, it was added immediately the rapid mixing was begun. The results were analysed using turbidity removal, pH and level of finished water alkalinity as yardsticks.It was found that turbidity removal generally continued to improve with increasing G with or without coagulant, with more substantial improvement obtained when coagulant was applied. However optimum coagulant dosage was 20, mg/1 alum or 30 mg/1 ferric chloride for all levels of G applied.Application of velocity gradients without coagulant generally had no significant effect on the pH and level, of finished water alkalinity. On the other hand, depressions in the pH values and levels of finished water alkalinity resulted when G was supplemented with coagulants, with greater depressions given by the ferric chloride than alum.Conclusively, high velocity gradients with and without addition of chemical coagulants have substantial effects on water coagulation. On the basis of the three yardsticks of turbidity removal, pH and level of finished water alkalinity, application of G with alum gave the best results.|Theses Collection|turbidity removal/coagulant/ferric chloride/G/alum/water alkalinity/*||||||Olaleye, Adedayo Olushola|M|A study of the development and performance of the civil service in western Nigeria, 1954-1976||||||Ph.D. Public Administration|||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Public Administration|1991|||OAU|||||xi, 284p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Generally, civil service systems in the third world have performed below these expectations with only a few exceptions.A body of literature in this field acknowledged and claimed that the Western Nigeria Civil Service has been on the whole successful in its effort to promote social and economic development in its milieu. This study documented and analysed the various dimensions of this acclaimed success of the Western Nigeria Civil Service between 1954 and 1976 with a view to ascertaining those factors responsible for the achievements of the service and examine those factors that hindered success. It thus sets out to evaluate the Civil Service through the use of some objective criteria for the measurement of the organisations performance. An input-output method was used to evaluate performance having considered the influence of the environment and the importance of availability of resources, personnel, funds and materials could play on organisational goal achievement.Furthermore, the historical method was adopted in this study in order to enable us collate and evaluate critically available evidence to buttress the conclusions reached. Archival survey and examination of literature were undertaken. Furthermore, samples of 120 past political and administrative actors were interviewed to validate or refute some of the views expressed in the literature.There was evidence of concrete achievement recorded throughout the period under study. Though the resources generated during the civilian era (1954 t0 1966) were lower than that generated during the military era (1966 to 1976), there were greater physical achievements  evidence of better performance.Also, there was an indication from the study that commitment to goals was greater during the early civilian era than during the period of military rule. The evidence showed that civil service performance was greatly enhanced by the nature of the environment, high degree of motivation and the successful cooperation between the administrative and political class.For the Civil Service to be able to meet the expectations of the future, it must be prepared to adapt to changes in the environment. Its structure and management must be conscious of the new business orientation of todays administration.|Theses Collection|business orientaion/western nigerian civil service/*||||||Olusi, Janet Omolara|F|An analysis of socio-economic factors influencing soyabean farming in Ekiti-Akoko Agricultural Development Project (ADP)||||||Ph.D. Agricultural Economics|Osuntogun, C.A.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Agricultural Economics|1991|||OAU|||||xiv, 210p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Current efforts to bridge this gap focus on integrating the numerous small scale farmers into the modern farming systems through the Agricultural Development Project situated in all states of the federation. One crop that is fast gaining popularity and which can reduce the twin problems of food shortage and malnutrition is soyabean. This study examined the socio-economic factors influencing the adoption of the crop's farming practices at the EAADP coverage area.The study involved 296 farmers randomly selected from the project's enclave. Structured questionnaires were used to collect data on the personal and farming characteristics of the farmers. Other sources of data include the EAADP Offices and Federal Agricultural coordinating Unit (FACU).Using correlation analysis, regression techniques, the Linear Probability Model and Production functions, the study revealed that the socio-economic factors influencing adoption scores of soyabean farmers positively include size of farm, farmers   proneness to innovation and farmers level of education. Household size, social-status and cost of variable factors affected adoption score negatively. On the other hand, the Linear Probability Model result showed that any farmer picked at random in the enclave had 36% probability of being an adopter.Adoption score elasticity showed that the most important variable that influenced changes in adoption score was the cost of variable inputs hence policy must focus on reducing the cost of variable inputs to farmers.The production functions confirmed that adopters were more efficient than non-adopters in the use of inputs. They also showed that the most important variable inputs in the production of soyabeans at the enclave were insecticides and herbicides.Constraints on adoption of soyabean practices were found to include high cost of inputs and lack of credit facilities to farmers. Even if credit were available the cost, that is, interest rate, was too high for the, average farmer. From the project's perspective, constraints include inadequacy of extension correlates, like roads, farming inputs and finance.The study concluded that efforts directed at reducing these bottlenecks would increase the adoption of soyabean practices and hence its output.|Theses Collection Theses Collection|food production in nigeria/EAADP/malnutrition/*||||||Osatuyi, Oluremi|F|Synthesis and acute toxicity tests of estragole and its derivatives||||||M.Sc.

A multi-stage sampling of 218 farmers across six local government areas of Oyo State constituted the primary data source.An adoption-intensity index was constructed to show one categorisation of farmers in the technological continuum. Simultaneous exploration of the data` set for the maximum likelihood estimation showed the optimum cut-off value for the index to be 35%. Subsequently, 57.34% of the farmers were classified as adopters, and the remaining) 42.66% non-adopters.In view of the dichotomous nature of this exercise, its formulation constituted a binary-choice model, and the probit specification had been employed.Based on the magnitudes of the coefficients, the results of the probit analysis indicated that the stimulus index of adoption was influenced more by the availability of storage facility, cropping pattern, membership of cooperatives, contacts with extension agents and land tenure. However, only  the coefficients of storage facility and extension contacts were significant at 5% level.The value of the extimated risk-aversion parameter was found to range between 0.87 (for lowest degree) and 1.72 (highest). Individual farmer's risk-aversion parameter was incorporated into the probit modal sand this was found to be significant at 5% level.The regression of the risk-aversion parameter with the personal characteristics of the farmers revealed an adjusted R2 of 0.37. Membership of cooperative societies, contact with extension agents and education were found to be significantly related to risk-bearing abilities of the farmers.The probit analysis of the effects of different policy alternative on adoption revealed that liberal credit had the greatest impact of increasing number of prospective adopters by 10.97%. This was followed by increased extension contacts (9.63%), and provision of storage facilities (4.59%).Based on these analyses, principal reasons for non-adoption fall into six broad areas. These in descending order, are non-availability of inputs, smallness of farms, inadequate knowledge, conservatism/traditional beliefs, financial constraints and unprofitability of the inputs.|Theses Collection|adoption-intesity index/probit analysis/cropping pattern/risk aversion parameters/*||||||Amoran, John Ayodele.|M|Financial Management Accountability in the National Youth Service Corps (19731989).||||||Ph.D.|Olu Omopariola||Ile-Ife,Nigeria|Obafemi  Awolowo  University, Management Accounting |1991.|||OAU|||||xiv, 4 31p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

It appraised their performances, identified areas of weaknesses and provided suggestions which can foster economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the organisation.The investigation involved two sets of populations code named Group A and B. The first, Group A, consisted of the staff of the National Youth Service Corps from the Directorate Headquarters and State Secretariats, whose office functions are related to financial management.  One hundred and eighteen members of staff were randomly selected and questionnaires administered on them. One hundred and eight completed questionnaires were received giving a response rate of 91.52%.The second, Group B, comprised of management consultants, corps members, employers of corps members and the general public.  Three thousand, six hundred and sixty members of the group were randomly selected and questionnaires administered on them.  Two thousand, one hundred and nine completed questionnaires were retrieved giving a response rate of 57.6%.The statistical information and financial data obtained were subjected to Funds Flow Analysis and Ratio Analysis to determine their economic and financial efficiency.The findings of this study revealed unsatisfactory performance in the management of finances of the organisation.  This is as a result of the nonadoption of modern financial management techniques in its financial management activities.|Theses Collection|financial management practices/National Youth Service Corps/consultants/corps members/ employers of corps members/statistical information /financial data/Funds Flow Analysis/Ratio Analysis/economic and financial efficiency/modern financial management techniques*||||||Erero, Ezaena John.|M|Leadership and Organizational Performance in Selected SouthWestern Nigerian Universities. ||||||Ph.D.| Dele Olowu.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University|1991|||OAU||||| xv, 352p.|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

The selected Universities were: Obafemi Awolowo University, IleIfe; University of Lagos, Lagos; University of Benin, BeninCity; University of Ilorin, Ilorin;  Bendel State University, Ekpoma; and the Federal University of Technology Akure.   The study covered the years between 1960 and 1986.The methodology employed was theoretical, descriptive and statistical. Primary data were collected through questionnaire and interview methods. Secondary data were collected from the National Universities Commission (NUC) Office in Lagos, and the central administration offices in each of the Universities.   Other relevant information was obtained from reports of visitation panels, reports of commissions of inquiry, official gazettes, the calendars of each of the Universities, addresses and speeches of the ViceChancellors, newspapers and magazines, and other published and unpublished works on Nigerian Universities.The study found out that while there exists a relationship between leadership styles and performance in SouthWestern Nigerian Universities, the nature of the relationship did not suggest a one best leadership style. Moreover, various factors were found to be mediators between leadership styles and performance.These include: the quality of the leader, the nature of politics in Nigeria, politics within the University, the impact of culture, the peculiarities of the academic enterprise and the role of the state in the management of Universities.In all, sixteen ViceChancellors were assessed with regard to their contributions to the performance of their institutions.   Six of them were perceived to be high achievers, five were scored as moderate achievers, while five were seen as low achievers.In conclusion, the study made some policy recommendations which could assist in the selection of Nigerian ViceChancellors as well as improving the performance of Nigerian Universities. It was recommended that the selection of ViceChancellors should be further democratized thereby making them more accountable to their constituents. It was further recommended that the Government should avoid as much as possible, the tendency to treat Universities as just another agency of government.  A further recommendation was that Nigerian Universities need to be better funded while the Universities should find ways of limiting their dependence on government funds. On a final note, it was recommended that at the end of every decade, there should be a mandatory and comprehensive review of the philosophy, goals and objectives as well as the performance of Nigerian Universities.|Theses collection.|ViceChancellors/SouthWestern  Nigerian Universities./ policy recommendations/Nigerian Universities/ performance of Nigerian Universities.*||||||Ojo, Adenike.|F| Impact of Government Policies on RuralDevelopment in Ondo State of Nigeria, 1976-1986||||||Ph.D.|Dele Olowu.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,Public Administration|1991|||OAU|||||xiv, 384p.|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

A total of 178 rural industrial establishments (processing, manufacturing and servicing concerns) were contacted, out of which 150 participated in the study, giving a response rate of 84%. Interviews were also conducted with selected members of local associations and officials of relevant governmental agencies. Descriptive statistical tools and relevant computer programmes were used for data analysis.The study found that the Federal and State Governments policies aimed at assisting industrialisation in the State mainly favoured largescale enterprises.  The few policies directed at the SSI sector were urbanfocussed, thus such policies tended to tilt the balance of competition against the ruralbased SSI. The upsurge observed in local associations business  motion activities in the form of joint ventures and some hips reflect collective response aimed at overcoming policies which tended to hinder SSI growth. Also within the conceptual scheme proposed, the study appraises the capacity of the rural SSI sector for meeting the basic needs of the agricultural and the entire rural population for goods and service at affordable cost, using  Ondo State as a case study.  It is also significant that rural SSI created employment for both sexes and especially for women as the latter constituted 53% of the proprietors and 48% of the total workforce.The study proceeds to assess and document the contributions of ruralbased SSI in the State to local rawmaterials sourcing, technology procurement, adaptation and utilisation, and utilisation. and integrated, rural enterprise development. It found that rural SSI face several external and internal constraints. Separating these critical factors, and instituting the key reforms proposed, would facilitate appreciation of the essence of the rural SSI sector and also improve its performance.The study thus recommends that Ondo State should adopt a policy of integrated rural development, through a vigorous strategy of rural economic diversification, with rural-based SSI as one of the crucial vehicles for a dynamic, competitive and economically integrated State. It stresses that neither bureaucratic centralism, paternalism nor the magic of market forces per se can bring about the needed sustainable rural transformation. It advocates lowcost, highimpact, massparticipatory strategies.  These are of primary relevance in encouraging an entrepreneurial  environment, promoting productivity, meeting the needs of the agricultural sector and of the rural population; while connecting the heights of the political and economic system with the lower stratum of the production structure, on which the former should rest.|Theses collection.|agricultural and industrial policies /smallscale industries (SSI) / rural industrial establishments/largescale enterprises*||||||Olaleye, Adedayo Olusola.|M| A Study of the Development and Performance of the Civil Service in Western Nigeria (1954-1976)||||||Ph.D.| A.O.

Generally, Civil Service systems in the Third World performed below these expectations, with only a few exceptions. A body of literature in this field acknowledged and claimed that the Western Nigeria Civil Service has been on the whole successful in its effort to promote social and development in its milieu.  This study documented and analysed the various  dimensions of this acclaimed success of the Western Nigeria Civil Service between 1954 and 1976 with a view to ascertaining those factors responsible for the achievements of the service and examine those factors that hindered success.   It thus sets out to evaluate the Civil Service, through the use of some objective  criteria for the measurement of the organization's performance. An inputoutput method was used to evaluate performance having considered the influence of the environment and the importance of availability of resources - personnel, funds and materials could play on organisational goal achievement.Furthermore, the historical method was adopted in this study in order to enable us collate and evaluate critically available evidence to evidence to buttress the conclusions reached.  Archival survey and examination of literature were undertaken.  Furthermore, a sample of 120 past political and administrative actors were interviewed to validate or refute some of the views expressed in the literature. There was evidence of concrete  achievement recorded throughout the period under study.  Though the resources generated during the civilian era (1954 to 1966) were lower than that generated during the military era (1966 to 1978), there were greater physical achievements  evidence of better performance.  Also, there was an indication from the study that commitment to goals was greater during the early civilian era than during the period of military rule.  The evidence showed that Civil Service performance was greatly enhanced by the nature of the environment, high degree of motivation and the successful cooperation between the administrative and political class. For the Civil Service to be able to meet the expectations of the future, it must be prepared to adapt to changes in the environment. Its structure and management must be conscious of the new business orientation of today's administration.|Theses collection.|Civil Service/developing countries/Third World/Western Nigeria Civil Service/organization's performance/resources - personnel/ civilian era /military era/structure and management*||||||Jayeola, Adeniyi Akanni|M|ComputerAided Taxonomic Study of the Angraecoid Orchids of Nigeria and Cameroun. ||||||Ph.D.|A.O Olatunji.||Ile Ife, Nigeria |Obafemi  Awolowo  University, Botany|1991|||OAU|||||xxxiii,352p.|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

Authorities differ in their interpretation of subtribal groups of this complex. Eightysix morphological characters as well as epidermal and pollinaria features were extracted from 100 angraecoid orchid species occurring in Nigeria and Cameroun. Four basic data matrices (BDM) comprising 18 (vegetative), 37 (vegetative and floral), 63 (floral) and 86 (vegetative, floral and ecological) characters by 100 operational taxonomic units (OTU's) were made.  A quantitative comparison of each BDM was then made by employing three computer-based classification techniques, Centroid Sorting (CS), Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).  The groupings from PCA and DCA were similar but both differed from the CS which misplaced several taxa.  The result based on 63 characters consistently deviated from those based on 18, 37 and 86 characters respectively.  The generic composition of the groups seem to be less influenced by the number than by the nature of the characters employed.On the basis of these results and additional evidence from the study of the epidermal and pollinaria systems, the angraecoid genera are divided into three groups, of which the leafless, comprising Microcoelia and Chaulidon is new. Investigations carried out on the vegetative morphology, leaf epidermis and pollinaria system revealed characters of taxonomic significance which helped to reinforce the results  of automated classification by computer.  The groupings resulting from both morphological and epidermal studies bear close correspondence to the groupings from the DCA and PCA.Evidences support the earlier moves of merger of Barombia with Aerangis, Rhipodoglossum with Diaphananthe and Encheridion with Microcoelia.  Further findings revealed that Tridactyle,  Solenangis and Dinklageella fit better in the Angraecinae than Aerangidinae.  For now, Solenangis and Dinklageella should continue to be maintained as distinct taxa while Listrostachys is better included in the Aerangidinae rather than Angraecinae.An indented, computer-aided key was prepared for the 100 OTU's which included 14 new records for West Africa.  The 37 characters used for the key-construction were coded according to the DELTA (Descriptive Language for TAxonomy) format to run the Key Constructing Program (KCONP), on an IBM Compatible Microcomputer System. The resulting automated key was stored in a floppy disc which is kept in the herbarium of the Department of Botany, Obafemi Awolowo University.

The work examined the extent to which the Authority was able to improve the socioeconomic environment of the rural communities through its programmes and services.  Such programmes included agriculture improvement schemes and water resources development activities. Furthermore, in view of the transfer of its agricultural production activities to other agencies like the Directorate of Foods, Roads and Rural Infrastructure (DFRRI), this study explored the range of functions left for O-ORBDA.In contrast to the high level of success associated with the River Basin Strategy in some countries such as the famous Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in the United States of America (USA), the achievements recorded by the O-ORBDA fell below expectation.  This low performance level could be explained in terms of the peculiar problems confronting the River Basin Authority.  The problems included government policy reversal and those of inadequacy of funds and technological expertise which the River Basin Authority would require for effective performance.The methodology adopted is impact study with a focus on an appraisal of the stated goals of the organisation. Preliminary data on the Authority's activities were gathered from its headquarters.  This provided background information which stimulated further investigations.  A questionnaire was administered on management and project staff of the Authority.  They were also interviewed on issues relating to the successes and failures of the programmes of the Authority.  Another questionnaire was used to ferret out information from 2,850 inhabitants of project area.  This figure included 1,040 or 62% of the 1,653 participating farmers and 1,810 other beneficiaries of the Authority's programmes.The study discovered that the Federal government had reviewed its involvement in the sustenance of high  cost irrigation projects.  This resulted in the existing array of uncompleted projects in OORBDA's jurisdiction.  Furthermore, the study showed that the Authority could not provide rural infrastructures to any significant extent as it was not fully equipped to perform that role. OORBDA recorded greater success in its agricultural production activities (now expunged from its schedule) more than it did in the provision of good roads, housing, electricity or health care delivery.  This was due to the inadequacy of resources available to it. A major implication of the findings is that O-ORBDA cannot be totally relieved of participating in agricultural production activities as it now provides irrigation water.  Besides, it is important that the Authority relates with the farmers to enable the latter accept its role and consequently patronise it. This patronage would in fact make the OORBDA viable and be less dependent on the Federal government's financial support.|Theses collection.|State intervention/rural development programmes/River Basin Development Authorities/Directorate of Foods, Roads and Rural Infrastructure (DFRRI)/high  cost irrigation projects/ rural infrastructures/agricultural production*||||||Bamire, Simeon Adebayo|M| Risk and Farm Investment among Farmers in OdoOtin Local Government Area of Oyo State, Nigeria.||||||M.

Data were collected from 160 farmers randomly selected from eight villages in Odo Otin LGA of Oyo state making use of structured questionnaire. These were then analysed through the use of safetyfirst model, Linear programming technique and discriminant analysis.Results from the safetyfirst model showed that farmers in the study area can be categorised into two namely: Risk Averse and Risk Preferring. It also indicated that about 81 percent of the farmers exhibit risk aversion.  The Linear Programming technique showed the effect of risk on the profitability of farmers' investments. Risk preferring farmers were found to be compensated by a higher return on their investment compared to those who exhibit risk averse behaviour. The discriminant Analysis technique however revealed that socioeconomic characteristics such as Land area,  level of schooling, offfarm income and membership of farming groups are positively associated with risk bearing.  It also supports the results obtained from the safetyfirst rule. The implication of plays a very important the study area; and ability of farmers, creased membership supports the results obtained from of the findings is that risk aversion tant role in farmers' behaviour within in order to improve the riskbearing ability of farmers, provision should be made for increased membership in farming groups.

A regression model was selected for each of the palm produce price data (palm oil price series and palm kernel price series) and then time series models were constructed for each regression residual series.The results of the regression analysis lend credence to the claim that statistical elegance of an econometric model is not directly related to its ability to forecast well. The RootMean-Square (RMS) simulation error, RMS forecast error and Theil coefficient (U2) of the linear models (having lower fit) were 95.97, 183.53 and 0.985 respectively for palm oil and 43.19, 52.76 and 1.05 respectively for palm kernel, whilst those of the double log models (having better fit) were 97.6, 201.17 and 1.08 respectively for palm oil and 43.84, 61.08 and 1.21 respectively for palm kernel.The combined regression  time series models (obtained by combining each residual time series model with respective regression model) out performed the regression models (though not appreciably particularly for palm oil price series). The RMS simulation error, RMS forecast error and U2 of (palm kernel) combined model were 85.27, 44.22 and  .878 respectively, whilst those of regression model were 93.73, 52.76 and 1.05 respectively.  For the (palm oil) combined models the values were 221.8l, 318.98 and 1.71 respectively  whilst those of the regression model were 230.52, 183.53 and 0.985 respectively.  In addition, the combined models provide better forecast of trends in prices of palm produce than the regression models.The results of the supply analysis indicated that the equations estimated using predicted palm produce prices obtained from the combined models provide better approximation (in terms of goodnessoffit and exhibited relationships) to the actual models than those estimated using predicted palm produce prices obtained from the regression models.|Theses collection.|Nigeria's palm produce/Central Bank of Nigeria/Federal Office of Statistics/conometric model/RootMean-Square (RMS) simulation error/RMS forecast error / Theil coefficient (U2)*||||||Osunade, James Adewale|M| Studies on the Suitability of Laterized Concrete for Grain Storage Silo|||||| Ph.D| Fola Lasisi||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi  Awolowo  University, Agricultural  Engineering| 1991|||OAU|||||xv, 216p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

Therefore, postharvest storage protections are essential in  order to reduce loses in agricultural produce particularly in  grains.  The complete absence or inadequate storage facilities on the farm seriously contribute to unaccountable loss of quality in grains for processing and consumption. In an attempt to produce an adequate storage structure having local material content, this project looks into the suitability of laterized concrete as a material for the construction of storage silos. Tests for workability, strength characteristics, physical and thermal properties including coefficient of friction of grain on wall materials, angle of internal friction, specific heat and thermal conductivity were carried out on the laterized concrete used in designing the silos.  Indices such as grain moisture variation, level of mould development, insects infestation, viability and changes in nutrient content of grains were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the laterized concrete silos.  The temperatures inside laterized concrete and metal silos were observed in response to changes in the external temperatures.  Mathematical expressions were developed for predicting temperature and moisture distribution  within the stored grains.  The expressions were tested.A slump value of 37.7mm and an average strength of 16.27N/mm2 were obtained for laterized concrete.  Of the three materials of construction tested, galvanized sheet metal gave the lowest coefficient of friction of 0.16 followed by plywood 0.33, and laterized concrete 0.35. Changes in the measured and simulated temperatures and moisture content for laterized concrete were smaller than those for the metal silos.  There were also lower levels of insect infestation, mould development and moisture content (below 14.5 per cent) in the laterized concrete.The results suggest that the design pressure for laterized concrete silo should be based not only on the load imposed on the wall by the grains but also on the frictional property of laterized concrete wall. The results further suggest that laterized concrete silos are better than metal silos for storing maize grains.|Theses collection.| tropics/farm produce/storage/ postharvest storage protections /grains/ local material content/ laterized concrete /coefficient of friction of grain/ grain moisture variation/mould development/insects infestation/changes in nutrient content/ metal silos*||||||Farinde, Akinloye Jimoh|M|Effectiveness of Extension Methods used in Disseminating Improved Agricultural 	Technologies in Lagos State|||||| M.

Emphases were placed on identification of the various extension methods used by the Lagos state Agricultural Development Projects (LSADP) extension workers and how the methods were selected; identification of the improved agricultural technologies disseminated to the farmers with the extension method(s), identification of the teaching aids used with the extension method(s) in disseminating each improved agricultural technology, and determination of the impact of the extension methods used on the level of adoption of improved agricultural technologies by the farmers.The study was conducted in five rural local government areas in Lagos state, out of the twelve local government areas in the State.  Structured interview schedule was used to collect information from one hundred and twelve fulltime male farmers in the project enclave, while structured questionnaire was completed by all the Lagos state ADP's extension workers. Fourteen circles under the five extension area units, two villages under each circle and four farmers from each village were  selected using the simple random sampling technique.  Descriptive statistical techniques like frequency counts, percentages, mean standard deviation and weighted mean score were used to analyse the data.  Correlation and regression analyses were used to determine the relationships between the variables investigated in the study. The results showed that all the extension workers found method and result demonstrations and farm visit as the  most appropriate and effective  methods  for disseminating all the improved agricultural technologies to the farmers.   About 87% of the extension workers selected their extension teaching methods based on the number of farmers to be reached and nature of practices to teach farmers. Inventory of the agricultural technologies showed that about fifteen improved agricultural technologies had been disseminated to farmers in Lagos state since the inception of LSADP in 1987. Specimen and record books were found most frequently used teaching aids with all the methods identified.  Eightyeight  percent of the farmers had adopted more than ten of the  improved agricultural technologies hence farmer's level of adoption was high.The study showed positive  and significant correlations between adoption of recommended practices and complexity of method (r = 0.042),  organization  of method (r = 0.334), extension workers' attitude towards self (r = 0.594), extension workers' years of formal training received (r = 0.395), size of the farm (r = 0.230) and cosmopoliteness (r = 0.206). Also, it shows negative but significant correlations between adoption of improved agricultural technologies and farmers' age (r = 1.814) and extension workers' knowledge of improved agricultural technologies (r = 0.339). To enhance methods' effectiveness, reliance must be placed on the use of the individual and group contact methods and obstacles such as cost, such as cost, complexity and difficulty in the organization of mass media methods should be removed for their effective uses.|Theses collection.| agricultural technologies/Lagos state Agricultural Development Projects (LSADP)/ farm visit/ extension workers/years of formal training*||||||Mwaseba, Dismas|M|Popular Participation in Rural Development Projects in Morogoro District of Tanzania||||||M.Phil| Joseph Adebanji Alao||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi  Awolowo  University  , Agricultural  Extensions and Rural Sociology| 1991||| OAU|||||xv, 174p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

The population was stratified by sex and the simple random sampling technique was used to draw 15 men and 15 women from each of the four study villages.  Consequently, the total sample size was 120.Interview schedule was used in eliciting relevant responses from the respondents.  Informal interviews were also conducted to supplement the data obtained through the interview schedule.  Data collection took place from July 15 to August 31, 1990.  The data collected were analysed through the use of such statistical methods as simple frequency counts, percentages, chisquare (X2) and contingency coefficient (C).The study found that the level of participation in the selected rural development projects undertaken communally was generally low.  It also found that 79.2% and 57.5% of the respondents participated in the implementation of the projects and election of village leaders respectively.  The study further found that 19.2%, 18.3%, 10.8% and 8.2% of the respondents respectively participated in decisionmaking, problem identification, planning and evaluation.  Despite the low level of participation in the projects, an overwhelming majority (94.4%) of the respondents assessed the projects as successful. The study also revealed that participation of the people in communal projects was hindered by individual and leadershiprelated problems.  The major problems related to the individuals that hindered participation in communal projects were personal commitments and poor health.  The major problems related to the leadership that hindered participation were lack of leadership accountability, poor organisation, favouritism and nepotism and lack of regular communication between the leaders and their followers about project progress.Statistically significant relationships were found between level of participation in communal projects and sex (X2 = 13.14), age (X2 = 7.03), membership in organisations (X2 = 10.18) and the mode of joining the projects (X2 = 17.59) at 0.05 level of significance.  Specifically, the data showed that a great number of men, members of organisations and respondents who joined the projects voluntarily and through persuasion participated in the projects more than women, nonmembers and those who joined the projects through coercion respectively.  The data also showed that a great number of respondents in the age group of 3655 years participated in the projects more than those in the other two age groups, namely below 35 years and above 55 years. No statistically significant relationships were found between the level of participation and the selected community characteristics, that is, level of village development (X2= .05), average number of ethnic groups (X2 .77) and village size (X2 .50) at 0.05 level of significance.   To promote popular participation in development, efforts should be made to encourage village leaders to make effective use of participatory structures such as the village assembly and embark on programmes aimed at overcoming the aforementioned problems.|Theses collection.|rural development projects/communal projects/leadershiprelated problems/ poor health/leadership accountability/poor organisation/favouritism and nepotism/ communal projects and sex*||||||Siyanbola, Adewale Tajudeen|M| Characteristics of Local Leaders and Adoption of some Agricultural Innovations in Ede North Rural Development Project Area||||||M.

Attention was focused on the personal, socio-economic and leadership characteristics of the respondents and adoption of the agricultural innovations introduced by the Department of Agricultural Extension and Rural Sociology, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife.Data were collected from one-hundred and two leaders and seventy-eight non-leaders in three villages in the project area during the months of January and February, 1991.  Structured interview schedules containing open and closed ended questions duly pretested were used to collect the data.  Leadership identification was done by positional and reputational techniques. The non-leaders interviewed were selected through simple random sampling.The study showed that leaders emerged more from the older male (84.3%), indigenous members of the community who had large families and more economic resources than others.  The identified leaders were also fairly educated with 5.70 years as the mean period of schooling.  The major criterion for recognising people as community leaders were: ability and willingness to contribute to community development which was mentioned by 60.8% of the leaders; economic base, 51.4%; and official position, 45.1%.The innovations studied had wide-spread adoption among leaders and non-leaders who were aware of them.  These included hybrid maize which was adopted by 92.2% and 86.3% of leaders and non-leaders respectively; improved cassava variety, 69.7% and 77.6%; fertilizers, 66.7% and 49%; improved sheep management, 95.0% and 97.6%; improved goat management, 83.6% and 73.1%; pre-emergent herbicides, 68.0% and 80.6%; crib, 48.6% and 57.1% and post- emergent herbicides, 94.1% and 73.3%.Cribs for grain storage and application of post-emergent herbicides were the only innovations of which the respondents were not widely aware.  Only 36.3% and 17.9% of leaders and non-leaders respectively indicated awareness of the crib as an innovation and 33.3% and 29.5% respectively of leaders and non-leaders were aware of post-emergent herbicides.Positive and significant relationships were found between adoption of innovation by leaders and age (r = 0.213); years of schooling (r = 0.197); years of residence (r = 0.312); cheerfulness (r = 0.296), and consideration (r = 0.514).  These mean that the greater the degree of these characteristics possessed by leaders, the greater the extent of their adoption of the agricultural innovations.Consideration was found to be positively and significantly associated with cheerfulness among leaders (r = 0.319) and non-leaders (r = 0.260).  This means that consideration increased with cheerfulness among both categories of respondents. Future leadership training programme should be organised in such a way to help leaders imbibe the culture of consideration and cheerfulness in dealing with their followers|Theses collection.|agricultural innovations /indigenous members/economic resources/hybrid maize/.improved cassava variety/pre-emergent herbicides/ grain storage*||||||Odubote, Idowu Kolawole|M|Genetic and non-genetic sources of variation in litter size, kidding interval and body weight at various ages in West African dwarf goats||||||Ph.D| J.O.

These include records on two hundred and twenty kiddings over a period of eight years (January 1982 - January 1989).  The records were obtained from the Nigerian-Dutch Research Project "Management of the West African Dwarf Goats in the humid tropics" sited at the goat unit of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching and Research Farm, Ile-Ife, Nigeria.The mean kidding interval and litter size at birth were 283.15 6.79 days and 1.70 0.04 kids respectively.  Parity, season and year of birth effects were significant (P < 0.01) for kidding interval.  Parity also had significant (P < 0.01) effect on litter size at birth.  The average litter size at weaning was 1.22 0.08 kids.Mean body weight at birth, 13 weeks, weaning, 26, 39 and 52 weeks of age were 1.280.01kg, 5.390.05kg, 6.260.05kg, 7.810.07kg, 9.960.09kg and 12.340.12kg respectively.  The mean litter weight were approximately twice the mean body weight at the different ages.  The type of birth, season and year of birth significantly (P < 0.01) affected body weight at all ages.  Males generally heavier than the females (P < 0.05) except at birth.  Kids delivered in the dry season had higher body weight at all ages considered except at birth.  Growth rate from birth to yearling was 30.145.81g per day.Sire effect and doe effect were significant (P <0.01) for all the traits considered except for body weight and litter weight at 52 weeks of age.  Heritability estimates of 0.280.005, and 0.180.003, 0.140.003, 0.290.005, 0.110.003, and 0.170.004 were obtained for litter size at birth, body weight at birth, weaning, 13, 26 and 39 weeks of age respectively.  Corresponding repeatability estimates were slightly higher than the heritability estimates.  Heritability estimates for litter weights at the various ages were generally moderate ranging from 0.23 to 0.56 except for litter birth weight which was 0.13.Phenotypic correlations among litter weights and among body weight were generally positive and significant (P < 0.01).  Parity and litter size were at the various ages studied except parity and 52-week body weight (P > 0.05).  The genetic correlations among body weights at the various ages were positive and significant (P < 0.01).An Annual Reproductive Rate of 2.19 kids and Productivity Index of 9.88Kg at weaning were obtained.  Litter weaning weight appears to be the best criterion for selection to improve body weights.  Selection for multiple birth is also likely to result in improvement of the litter size at birth.|Theses collection.|West African Dwarf Goats/Nigerian-Dutch Research Project/Teaching and Research Farm/litter size/Mean body weight /mean litter weight/yearling /Sire effect /doe effect/Phenotypic correlations/Annual Reproductive Rate/ Productivity Index*||||||Adefemi, John Adegbite|M| Effect of Methods of Establishment, Planting Date and Population Density on Amaranth Grain Production||||||M.Phil.| O.

Field studies were carried out to evaluate the influence of methods of establishment, planting date and population on the agronomic performance of three Ameranthus species:  Amaranthus cruentus L., A. hybridus L., and A. hypochondriacus L.  Also investigated in the screenhouse were the appropriate herbicides for controlling weeds in grain Amaranths. The results showed that the Amaranthus species performed better in the early season than in the late season.  Generally, seeds planted with sawdust emerged earlier than in the other methods of establishment.  Drilled, hillplanted and transplanted plants grew taller, had more inflorescences and produced higher grain yield than sawdust-treated plants.Generally, the Amaranth species performed better in the May and June planting dates than in the August or September planting dates.  Plants were taller with more branches longer inflorescences, larger leaf area and better grain yields in May and June than in August and September plantings.  Grain yield per plant was highest at 40,000 plants/ha. However, the highest grain yield/ha irrespective of the species and date of planting was obtained at the highest population density of 160,000 plants per ha.  A. hypochondriacus produced the highest grain yield of 917 and 886 kg/ha in May and June, respectively at 160.000 plants/ha.In the screenhouse, the Amaranthus species responded similarly to the herbicide treatments; alachlor, diuron, metolachlor, and metribuzin were phytotoxic to the amaranth plants when applied preemergence, irrespective of the time of application, while imazaquin was lethal to the plants.  Alachlor, diuron, metolachlor and metribuzin applied postemergence were slightly toxic to the plants.  However, the toxicity symptoms disappeared later and subsequent growth and grain yield per plant were not adversely affected.  Bentazon was slightly toxic to the plants irrespective of the time of application and this toxicity was also overcome at the later stage of growth.  At the two times of application, fluazifopbutyland sethoxydim were nonphytotoxic to the plants irrespective of the species.  The plants treated with bentazon, fluazifopbutyl and sethoxydim, irrespective of the time of application, had similar length and dry weight of inflorescence and grain yield per plant with the control, indicating that these herbicides can be used selectively weed control in grain amaranth.|Theses collection.|planting date/ population density/ grain amaranth production/Ameranthus species/herbicides/ inflorescences/sawdust-treated plants/Grain yield per plant/screenhouse*||||||Bewaji, Francis Akinlabi|M|A Survey and Herbicidal Control of Water Hyacinth and Associated Aquatic Weeds found in Ilaje/EseOdo Local Government Area of Ondo State, Nigeria||||||M.

Solms) and associated aquatic weeds found in the water ways of the LGA.  Information was also obtained on the phytotoxicity of herbicides on the predominant weeds, the persistence of the herbicides in water, and water quality changes following a herbicidal control of the weeds in the screen house.     In the aquatic weed surveys, density of the weeds was determined from 1m2 floatable quadrats. Measurements were also made on some growth parameters of selected flowering water hyacinth plants.  The phytotoxicity of asulam (Methyl [(4aminopheny1) sulfony1] carbamate), 2,4D  [(2,4dichlorophenoxy) acetic acid], Actril DS, a formulated mixture of Ioxynil (4hydroxy3,5diiodobenzonitrile) + 2,4D, diquat [6,7dihydrodipyrido (1,2(x :2, 1-C) pyrazine diium ion], paraquat (1,1dimethyl4, 4-bipyridinium ion), glyphosate [N(Phosphonomethyl) glycine)] and terbutryn [N(1,1dimethylethyl)N ethyl6(methylthio)1,3,5triazine2,4diamine] each foliarly applied at two rates on water hyacinth and water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes Linn.) was monitored for 28 days after application in the screen house.  The persistence of 2,4D, diquat, paraquat, and terbutryn was also monitored in water for 12 weeks following their application on water hyacinth and water lettuce. Residues of herbicides in water samples were extracted by standard procedures and analysed using a UVSpectrophotometer.  The physicochemical parameters of water quality were determined by standard methods.Water hyacinth was the most predominant aquatic weed (72% abundance) followed by water lettuce (17%).  Eleven other    identified weeds were low in abundance (11%).  Three forms of water hyacinth (small, medium and giant forms) wore identified.  The smallest form has a mean height of 11cm and nonbulbous leaf petioles; the medium form has a mean height of 19cm and is characterised by bulbous leaf petioles while the giant form has a mean height of 89 cm and nonbulbous leaf petioles. Both water hyacinth and water lettuce were susceptible to a single spray application of 2,4D, diquat and paraquat each at 2.0 kg a.i./ha, ioxynil + 2,4D at 3.0 kg a.i./ha and terbutryn at 1.0 kg a.i./ha. Glyphosate at 1.5 and 3.0 kg a.i./ha was not effective on water hyacinth although found effective on water lettuce, while asulam at 2.0 and 4.0 kg a.i./ha was not effective on any of the two weeds.Herbicide residues increased from an initial low level (0.001  0.25 ppm) immediately following application to a peak value of 0.52 ppm at 2 weeks after treatment (WAT) in water lettuce, and 0.66 ppm at 4 WAT in water hyacinthculture tanks.  By 6 and 10 WAT no residue was detected in water lettuce and water hyacinthculture tanks, respectively, irrespective of herbicide treatments.Water temperature, pH, and some major nutrients which were low under the cover of water hyacinth and water lettuce increased due to mineralisation of the dead and decaying weeds following herbicide application. Dissolved oxygen was however low due to the presence of weeds and its utilization by microorganisms responsible for the decaying of dead weeds. The results of this study show that herbicides when carefully selected and applied have potentials for the control of water hyacinth and water lettuce in Nigeria.|Theses collection.|abundance of water hyacinth/ aquatic weeds/phytotoxicity of herbicides/screen house/bulbous leaf petioles/ spray application/Water temperature/ pH/Dissolved oxygen*||||||Amusan, Alani adeagbo|M|Pedogenesis in granitic gneiss of humid tropical Southwestern Nigeria|||||| Ph.D|T.I.

Four modal deep soil profiles representing the dominant soil series of Iwo and Ondo formed from coarse and medium-grained granitic gneiss were selected.  Morphological, physical, chemical and mineralogical changes resulting from rock-saprolite-soil transformations were studied.The solum depth for both soil types ranges from 180-273 cm and the saprolite extends beyonds 3m.  The surface 0-20cm horizon is slightly gravelly (2-16%), coarse sandy loam, and dark bronw (7.5 YR 4/2 YR 3/3).  The sub-soil at 20-75cm is uniformly yellowish red (5 YR 4/6) in Iwo series and strong brown (7.5 YR 5/6) to red (2.5 YR 4/6) in Ondo series and gravelly (27-42%) sandy clay loam to sandy clay.  The subsequent underlying horizons are mottled.A consideration loss of the basic cations and silica occurs during rock-saprolite-soil weathering with residual accumulation of Fe and Al oxides.  Experimental leaching of the rock-sample sufficiently confirms these observations, and also suggests hydrolytic weathering.  Factors suggested to have encouraged hydrolytic weathering in Southwestern Nigeria are high rainfall, continuously high soil temperature, acidic precipitation and siliceous parent rock.  The cation exchange capacity by summation method (CEC-sum) ranges from 12.46 - 26.06 and 13.68 - 22.54 me/100g soil in Iwo and Ondo series respectively.  Percentage base surface is less than 35% for both series.  The relatively high amount of pH-dependent charges (PDC) and DCB-Fe2O3 indicate that the soils are intensively weathered.The fine sand of Iwo series contains predominantly quartz (50-80%) and hydrous mica (5-30%), while quartz (85-95%) dominates with traces of kaolinite in Ondo series.  Feldspar, hydroxy-Al-interlayered vermiculite, maghemite and kaolonite occur in small amounts in Iwo series.  Quartz (45-60%), kaolinite (5-10%) and hydrous mica (5-10%) dominate the silt fraction in Iwo series but mainly kaolinite (20-60%) and quartz (20-60%) in Ondo series.  Gibbsite, goethite, metahalloysite and hydrous mica also occur in the silt fraction in small amounts.  The clay fraction in Iwo series contains kaolinite (50-60%), hydrous mica (8-10%), metahalloysite (8-10%), gibbsite (8-10%) and quartz (4-8%).  In Ondo series, the clay fraction is predominantly kaolinite (> 80%) with about 10% metahalloysite.Ferrallitic pedogenesis is proposed for the soils.  Lessivation, induration and braunification are recognised as other dominant pedogenetic processes.  The study indicates that Ondo series are more developed than Iwo and that the occurrence of gibbsite is not necessarily an indication of advanced weathering stage in soils of Iwo series in SW-Nigeria.|Theses collection.| granitic gneiss /humid tropical Southwestern Nigeria/mineralogical changes/solum depth/ basic cations/silica/ rock-saprolite-soil weathering/ hydrolytic weathering/ quartz/Ferrallitic pedogenesis*||||||Afolayan, Stephen  Funsho|M|External and Socio-Political Transformation in Pre-Colonial Igbomina||||||Ph.D|I.A.

It evaluated the nature of autochthonous existence and the level of sociopolitical development in Igbomina before the emergence of the dynastic states.  It then assessed the relations of the Igbomina with their neighbours, namely, the Edo, Ijesa, Ekiti, Oyo, Nupe, Ibadan and Fulani.  The trends and patterns of external domination, the responses of the Igbomina to these external contacts, and their impact on the Igbomina were discussed.The methodology employed consisted of the analysis of primary and secondary sources, on the Yoruba, Nupe and Fulani, the three ethnic groups with dominant imperial interests in the area.  An extensive and intensive oral investigation was carried out in the study area.  Various categories of oral sources, archival and official records, and existing ethnographic, linguistic  and archaeological data were collected, corroboratively and critically examined.The thesis found that, contrary to popular traditions, the advent of the Ife-Oyo migrant groups in Igbomina area was not the beginning of the peopling of the region. It also discovered, that there is no credence in the generally accepted tradition of a common origin, common migration and similar antiquity for the various Igbomina groups. The thesis showed that the various Igbomina groups came to their different locations from  different places, for various reasons and at different times.  The study further found that the location of Igbomina in the middle belt of Nigeria, and on the frontiers of the Nupe, Oyo and Fulani, made it an area of plural cultural interactions and a focal point in the struggle for power and supremacy among these more powerful neighbours.The thesis concluded that the forces of external pressure were the most dominant factors in the development of Igbomina society.  External contacts resulted not only in ruins and desolation but in a profound lasting social, economic, demographic, political and military transformation of the society.  The Igbomina became prone and vulnerable to external dominion because of their internal decentralisation; conversely, external domination resulted in internal socio-political transformation which paved the way for unification and the emergence of the Igbomina as a district sub-group of the Yoruba.|Theses collection.|pre-colonial Igbomina/frontier cultural group/central Nigeria/ autochthonous existence/sociopolitical development/dynastic states/external domination/imperial interests/internal decentralisation*||||||Ashe, Muesiri Oberorakpovioma|F| The Evolution and Impact of local Government Administration in Eastern Urhobo Area of Bendel State, 1952 - 1983||||||M.A|A.A.

It focuses on  the Eastern Urhobo area of Bendel State.  The research methodology employed includes the collection and systematic evaluation of documentary evidence, oral information and archival materials.  These are supplemented by published works.  The analysis indicates that by 1983 the Eastern Urhobo were yet to find a satisfactory local government institution to replace the one that was abolished by the British in 1900.  It is also clear that starting with the Native Courts proclamation of 1900 and Native Authority ordinance of 1916, Eastern Urhoboland witnessed various changes in the search for a viable local government system up to 1983.  In addition, it is found that the local authority system did not have much significant impact on the area during the period under consideration. This is because the Eastern Urhobo local government authority was faced with two sets of problems.  The first set was the internal weaknesses within the local government council.  The other was the general shortcoming of the local government system in Nigeria. Finally, the study shows  that the already existing macrostudies in the field have created some problems of generalisation that can hardly be resolved without researches at a microlevel.|Theses collection.|local government system in Nigeria/Eastern Urhobo area / Bendel State/British/ Native Courts proclamation of 1900/ Native Authority ordinance of 1916*||||||Aregbesola,Michael Oluwole|M|A Critical Examination of the Nature of Perception and Knowledge in Plato's Theaetetus|||||| M.A|J.T.Bedu-Addo||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi  Awolowo  University     Philosophy|1991|||OAU||||| xii, 171p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

Attention was thus focussed on the first definition of knowledge offered in the dialogue  Theaetetus, namely, that knowledge its perception (151E186E).  This consideration necessitated a comprehensive elucidation of the analysis of perception contained in that section of the dialogue.  Furthermore, this study examined Plato's argument against the thesis that knowledge is perception.  It also evaluated the veracity of Plato's view of the role of sense- perception in the process of acquiring knowledge.The methodology employed in this study was a combination of critical analysis and argumentation.  Specifically, Plato's major dialogues such as the The Theaetetus, the Phaedo, the Timaeus and the Republic, and other relevant texts and commentaries were assessed.The thesis established that contrary to the assumption of some scholars that Plato's Theaetetus contains one continuous theory of perception, there are two different accounts of the nature of perception in the relevant section of the dialogue  the explicit and the implicit theories of perception.  It was also established that while Plato cannot be said to subscribe to the explicit theory, the implicit theory truly represented his view on perception as evident in the Timaeus, the Phaedo and the Republic.  The thesis concluded that in Plato's theory, the role of sense perception as a theory of knowledge is limited.|Theses collection.|Platot's dialogues/dialogueTheaetetus/critical analysis/argumentation/ Phaedo/Timaeus/the Republic/explicit theory/*||||||Ebijuwa, Temisanren|F|Women's Autonomy and the Problem of Abortion||||||M.A. Philosophy|M.

It examined the arguments for the case that abortion is immoral, and considered the relevance of various third-party interests in the fetus to the debate about the morality of abortion. The methodology employed was critical philosophical analysis of journal articles and standard texts published within the last twenty-five years in the area of moral philosophy and applied ethics.  In addition, some decided court cases on abortion and related matters were critically analysed.The thesis found that most of the discussions on the subject of abortion in moral philosophy have been based upon the mistaken assumption that in order to show that abortion is morally impermissible, all arguments must proceed from the status and the rights of the fetus, or from a third-party's interest in the fetus.  It was found that woman, as autonomous and rational agents, have the right to determine their role in procreation and have sovereignty over what is immediately affecting their lives.The thesis concluded that once we recognise that unwanted pregnancy is a threat to the health of the woman, and the state as acknowledges it as its duty to protect each of its citizens from even the minimum amount of threat, the state has a primafacie duty to provide abortion services to pregnant women seeking abortion.

Rituals, festivals and ceremonies were observed for a period Of three years in Ijebu land.  Other primary sources such as government publications, archival materials, newspapers, as well as relevant secondary sources, such as dissertations and books, were examined.  Furthermore, the study made a comparative analysis is of Traditional Religion together with Islam and Christianity.The study demonstrated that the indigenes of IjebuOde regard biological relationships as being of utmost importance to the extent that biological relationships supercede individual religious affiliation.  The study also revealed that Ijebuode has been able to preserve its traditional cohesion and has achieved interreligious harmony because the ljebugive their religious loyalty to the community as a whole.The study concluded that religion sacralized and supports kinship identity, making it able to cope with changes brought in by modernization.

This study was therefore conducted to describe, from the perspectives of the lfe people themselves, the central ceremonies, myths and rituals in IleIfe religious life and to show the social and religious significance of these myths and rituals especially in the integration of Ife community.  It also examined the claim in the study of religions that myths precede rituals in religious world views of traditional peoples.A total of nineteen eminent traditional chiefs, herbalists, farmers, and traders of Ilelfe origin whose ages ranged between 50 years and 80 years were visited and interviewed orally. Personal observations were also made of some physical structures which had relevant significance to the study.  In addition secondary materials from libraries and museums were used. The data collected were subjected to a phenomenological analysis.The result of the study showed that myths and rituals are central to Ife religious world view.  It was revealed that the popular Ife religious myths relate to the lives of some heroes such as Ogun, Obatala, Moremi and heroines in lleIfe who have become deified as a result of their activities in the service of mankind.  It further showed  that myths and rituals in the traditional religion of Ife people are intricately related and intertwined so much so that it is difficult to know which one precedes the other.In addition it was revealed that the deeds and activities of the gods which constituted the central focus of the myths and rituals were in connection with the acquisition of power and medicine for the maintenance of the society and the kingdom.Finally, it was shown that a scholarly focus on myths and rituals would yield new and better perspectives on the nature and study of Yoruba traditional religious communities.|Theses collection.|Ife traditional society/ religious beliefs/rituals/ traditional chiefs/herbalists/ Ogun/Obatala/ Moremi/myths*||||||Adebajo, Olusola Oladipo|M|Agbeyewo Ise Awon Asiwaju Onkowe Yoruba lati Odun 1848 si Odun 1938||||||Ph.D|Akinwumi Isola||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi  Awolowo  University ,Yoruba Language & Literature| 1991||| OAU||||| xv, 394p|||||||Yoruba||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

In realisation of this broad topic, this work is not hampered by the compartmentalisation always associated with literature viz categorisation under prose, poetry and drama, We examined Yoruba publications of the period in totality.  But because of our limited knowledge in the fields of linguistics and Yoruba Language, we excluded books on Yoruba language and the Dictionaries produced during the period under reference.  The specific objectives of this research are twofold.(a) This work critically examined the works of earliest Yoruba authors from 1848, when the first publication in Yoruba was produced, to 1938 when the late D.O. Fagunwa started the popularisation of the Yoruba novel, (b) It also examined in greater details the structural pattern and peculiar literary devices employed by each author.In order to successfully accomplish our task the following were our research methodology: (a)  The National Archives in Ibadan and Lagos and archival materials elsewhere were used. (b) Relevant materials in the State and Local Government libraries in Ibadan, Abeokuta, Akure, ljebuOde etc, were consulted. University Libraries especially the ones that stock old materials were made use of.  Examples of these are: the Africana Library of the University of Ibadan, the Institute of African Studies of the same University, the Gandhi Library of Lagos University and etc.  Besides, Corporate and personal libraries were made use of.  Examples are the S.S. Peter and Paul Library Ibadan, the libraries of Bishop Seith lrunsewe Kale and the late Reverend D.O. Epega.  (c)Elderly Yoruba men and women who themselves were editors of Yoruba Newspapers and authors of relevant books were interviewed.  Some of them are Paa Adegboyega Sobande who was editor of the popular Akede Eko and Chief T.T. Solaru, a retired Methodist Bishop. (d) Our findings and materials were then collated and critically examined.Chapter one of the thesis traces the activities of Christian. missionaries, the reduction of Yoruba Language to writing and the life history of some of the authors at the time and what prompted them to write Yoruba books.  Chapter two is devoted to the structure of the books.  Chapters three and four treat in details the content of the books under literature and NonLiterature books respectively. The  fifth chapter is devoted to the critical examination of the particular literary devices employed by the authors. The concluding part gathers the threads of thoughts together highlighting our findings viz: (a)  that no formal attempt has been made so far for the collection and critical examination of a mixedgrill kind of work as we now present, (b) that nonLiterature books have their own intrinsic values for the literary critic, and attention is being drawn to this area for further studies.  |Theses collection.|early Yoruba Writers/Yoruba publications/linguistics/National Archives/Christian. missionaries/Akede Eko/NonLiterature books*||||||Akinyemi, Akintunde|M|Ilo Oriki Lawujo Ilu Oyo|||||| Ph.D|Akinwumi Isola||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi  Awolowo  University ,Yoruba Language and Literature|1991||| OAU|||||xvii, 530p|||||||Yoruba||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

This thesis is therefore an attempt to cover part of the vacuum.  This thesis aimed at examining the Oyo town example of the uses of oriki in Yoruba societies. It aimed at identifying, describing and reappraising the various forms of Yoruba oriki. It also aimed at examining and describing the ubiguitous but changing nature of oriki in some selected oral literature in Oyo town. The sociopolitical and economic contexts of the creation and function of oriki in Oyo town were also examined.The methodology employed consisted of the analysts of data collected from the field on oriki.  An extensive and intensive oral investigation was carried out in the study area.  Various categories of archival and library records, and existing historical and literary data were collected and critically examined. For the purpose of our analysis, we adopted a Marxist sociology of literature approach in its broadest sense.The thesis found that the popular convention that oriki is the essence and the most dominant element of the content of most of the Yoruba oral literature is also true of the oral genres in town. In addition, the thesis found out that rara, a popular variety of Oyo chant, was a chanted variety of oriki, in which various types of personal names, personal oriki, nickname, appellation, individual oriki and orile play a prominent part.  The thesis also discovered that oriki forms the basis of all the Oyo traditional religious chants used in the worship of their Orisa. The thesis discovered, however, that contrary to popular convention, the role played by oriki in the creation of oral literature in Oyo town varies from one genre to the other.  The thesis further found that, the content of oriki, as used in Oyo traditional society is meant to defend project and protect the ideological views of the ruling class. The thesis also observed that the present economic changes and their attendant  social values had affected the uses and role of oriki in the creation of oral literature in the present-day Oyo town. The thesis concluded that the term is more elastic in Oyo town than a mere 'praise', 'descriptive" or 'lineage' poetry when compared with the ones in other Yoruba towns.  Oriki is equivalent to names  names which can indicate undesirable as well as desirable qualities and which are seen as being in some way the key to a subject's essential nature. In short, oriki situates a person or thing within his or its society.  In a society like the Oyo town, where poetry is the main vehicle of expression for ideological views and also the main source of information about historical social structures, oriki is very important.|Theses collection.|oriki/Oyo town/Yoruba societies/popular convention/oral literature /Marxist sociology/rara*||||||Ayanwole, Samson Adeyeye|M|An Appraisal of the Effectiveness of the Workers' Education Programe of Osogbo Steel Rolling Company in Nigeria||||||M.A|T.O.

It also aimed at examining whether there was a significant relationship between the objectives of workers' education as stated by management and the outcome as seen by both management and the workers of Osogbo Steel Rolling Company.  The study was undertaken with the belief that workers continuing education, which is an aspect of adult education, could promote efficiency and productivity in industries, as well as the development of human potentials, if such programmes were effectively executed.  The study also examined the scope, objectives, mode of practice, provisions of incentives and availability of facilities for the execution of workers' education in the O.S.R.C.The sample comprised 70 management staff and 70 workers making a total of 140 subjects randomly selected from the various departments of the company.  The instrument used to collect relevant data for the study was designated (AWEP0) 'Appraisal of  Workers' Education Programme Questionnaire'.  The data collected were then analysed by using the appropriate statistical methods like Spearman rank order correlation, t-test analysis.  Each hypothesis was tested at 0.01 level of significance.  Percentages were also used to identify the level of performance for each of the factors considered in the issue.The results of the study revealed that there was no significant difference between the objectives of workers' education as stated by management and the outcome as seen by the management and the workers of O.S.R.C. The study, however, found that the percentage effectiveness in terms of outcome of workers' education was found to be very high.  Similarly, the practice of different types of workers' education programmes at O.S.R.C. was found to have fallen below average (31.2%), and thd the commonly practised types were inservice training, onthejob training, and seminar. Again, the provision of workers' education facilities at O.S.R.C. has not been very encouraging (53.8%). The study revealed that, library   facilities were inadequate, while the provision of incentives for workers to participate in workers' education programmes in the company was also found to have fallen below average (47.2%). However, there was an indication that, to a greater extent (61.4%), the curriculum of workers' education at the Osogbo Steel Rolling Company has been found very relevant to the needs of the workers. |Theses collection.| workers' education/Osogbo Steel Rolling Company (O.S.R.C.)/adult education/curriculum of workers' education*||||||Obilade, Oluyemisi Oluremi|M|Assessment of Resource Allocation System in the Implementation of Adult Education Programmes in Selected Nigerian Universities||||||Ph.D.|T.O.

The study investigated the level of interest in adult education, the popularity of adult education and the contributions of adult education to the final assessment (G.P.A.) of education students. The study too examined the criteria used for allocating resources in Nigerian Universities as well as the efficiency, adequacy or otherwise of such existing criteria.  The study also made an attempt to assess how effectively and efficiently the resources allocated are utilized by the departments of interest within the universities considered.The sample for the study consisted of three out of six universities commonly referred to as "first generation universities".  The universities were selected through random sampling procedure.  Two research instruments, 'The Resource Utilization Growth/Departmental Output Rating (RUG/DOR) Efficiency Index", and 'The Financial Resource Assessment Questionnaire, FRAQ' were developed and utilized to collect data from the sample population.  The data collected were analysed using various statistical instruments and models such as the ttest, chisquare, oneway ANOVA, twoway ANOVA, Spearman's Rank Correlation, the Turkey Test, the Bartlett test, the Kruskal-Wallis Test and the Randomised Complete Block Design (RCBD).  All hypotheses were tested at 0.05 level of significance.The results of the study indicated that there was a generally high interest in and popularity of adult education courses with sampled students having taken a mean load of 8 units of adult education courses for graduation, and above 96% of the sample having taken at least one adult education course for graduation.The results revealed that adult education courses were found to have contributed positively to the final assessment (G.P.A.) of the students, as illustrated by the fact that the average value of adult education (VAE) for the 147 sampled students was as high as +0.0119. The results also revealed that the Departments of Adult Education in the selected universities were consistently underfinanced in relation to other comparable departments throughout the period under investigation.  An indication of this is the fact that the growth rates in votes were found to be generally higher for Physical Education than for Adult Education in all the universities sampled.Finally, despite lower and dwindling financial resources, the results established the fact that Departments of Adult Education showed greater cost efficiency than the Departments of Physical Education, as indicated by their DOR values which were consistently higher on the average than that for Physical Education.|Theses collection.| resource allocation system/adult education programmes/Nigerian Universities /financial resources/The Resource Utilization Growth/Departmental Output Rating (RUG/DOR) Efficiency Index/ 'The Financial Resource Assessment Questionnaire, FRAQ*||||||Osuji, Basil Ebube|M|The  Relationship between Developmental Tasks and SocioDemographic Variables among Adult Learners in Ife Central Local Government Area of Oyo State.||||||M.A.|J.A.

The study was undertaken with the belief that adult education could enhance the achievement of the developmental tasks if such adult education programmes are well organised. The study also examined the relative importance of the sociodemographic variables to adult learners' achievement of the developmental tasks.The study population comprised  1,000 adult learners enrolled in adult education classes from which stratified random sample of 300 was selected. Bases for stratification were gender, age, income  and occupational level groups.  The instrument used for the study was the 'Adulthood Developmental Tasks Questionnaire' (ADTQ) adapted from the list of Havighurst's developmental tasks.  The data collected were analysed by calculating the means for each sample subcategory and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to test the stated hypotheses. The results of the study revealed that the variables such as gender, age, income, and occupation were not significant factors influencing the subjects'  perception of developmental tasks.  The study, however, found that the female adults had a higher mean score (x = 4.04) in their ratings of the developmental tasks than their male counterparts (x = 3.83) though the difference was not statistically significant.  Similarly, the middleaged adults obtained a higher mean score (x = 4.12) in their rating of the developmental tasks than their young adults (x = 3.67) and later adults (x = 3.10) counterparts.Again, the middle income adults rated the developmental tasks higher (x = 4.02) then their lower income (x = 3.83) and upper-income (x = 4.01) colleagues, while the civil servants had a higher mean scope (x = 4.12) than their counterpart farmers (x = 3.60), Traders (x = 3.61) and "Others" (x = 3.28) who did not fall within the occupational groups identified.|Theses collection.|developmental tasks/ adult education programmes/sociodemographic variables/Havighurst's developmental tasks/female adults/ income*||||||Adeniyi, Victor Adewale|M|Effects of Assertiveness Training as a Behavioural Modification Technique for Low Self Students in Secondary Schools.|||||| M.A.|J.A.

The research was designed to determine whether the sex, age and the focus or the training which was used on school setting could influence the effectiveness of assertive therapy.Subjects for the study were selected from Urban-Day Grammar School, lleIfe, through a stratified sampling procedure.  The sample, numbering fortyeight were equally divided and assigned to experimental and control groups with adequate consideration given to their ages and sexes. Two research instruments designated School Setting Questionnaire Measure of Assertiveness (SSQMA) and Out of Schoolenvironment Questionnaire Measure of Assertiveness (OSQMA) were administered on all subjects before and after the training to collect information on their level of assertiveness.  The data obtained were analysed using  appropriate statistical procedure namely mean standard deviation and ttest. The level  of significance was fixed at 0.05.The results of the data analysis revealed that assertiveness training had positive significant effect on low self esteem students in secondary schools.  A significant difference was also observed in the effects of assertiveness training on the two sexes. Furthermore, the result showed that there is a significant difference in the effect of assertiveness training on different age groups of early adolescence (1114 years) and late adolescence (1518 years). It was also discovered that assertiveness training based on school setting had an effect in solving other interpersonal problems encountered by the subjects outside the school.The findings of this study showed that assertive training should be given to students in secondary schools especially when they are entering secondary schools in order to place them on equal starting point with others who are good asserters.|Theses collection.| low self esteem /students/secondary schools/assertive therapy/sex/age*||||||Alao, Kayode Ayodeji|M|Demographic Variables and Vocational SelfConcept as Correlates of Career Decision-Making Among Students in some Nigerian Universities.||||||Ph.D. | Olu Makinde||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi  Awolowo  University, Education Foundation and Couselling|1991|||OAU||||| xviii, 320p.|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

The demographic variables whose correlations with career decision making were investigated included under age, gender, birth position, religious background, parents' literacy status,  students' ethnic and faculty affiliations.  The study also investigated the effects of University setting on students' career  decision-making skills of planning, exploration and information processing.  The  subjects of the study were 678 undergraduate students selected through stratified random  sampling technique from Obafemi Awolowo University, llelfe; Ahmadu Bello University,  Zaria; University of Nigeria, Nsukka; Bendel State University, Ekpoma and Cross Rivers State University, Uyo.  Four test batteries namely, Demographic Data Inventory (DDI), the Vocational Self Concept Rating Scale (VSCRS), the Assessment of Career DecisionMaking (ACDM) and Career Development Inventory (CDI) were used to collect data.  Data gathered were analysed using chisquare, contingency coefficients, Pearson Product Moment Correlation, OneWay Analysis of Variances and Duncan's Multiple Comparison Test. All hypotheses were tested at 0.05 level of significance.The results of the study indicated that students' demographic background generally bears no significant relationship with students' career decisionmaking. About  82% of the students exhibiting high decisionmaking competence were from the major ethnic groups, while only 18% of the students from ethnic minorities exhibited high career decisionmaking competence despite the fact that ethnic minorities accounted for 37.7% of the subjects sampled.  Faculties of Education and Science accounted for the majority of subjects with high career decision making competence. These two faculties accounted for 62.2% of the students exhibiting high decisionmaking competence. Students' vocational selfconcept was found to be  to significantly related to career decisionmaking style.  The finding here confirmed that 87% of the students with highly crystallised vocational selfconcept also exhibited planful decisionmaking style, while 55.6% of students with poorly crystallised vocational selfconcept exhibited dependent or intuitive decisionmaking styles. Similarly, students' vocational selfconcept was also found to be significantly related to their careerplanning and career information processing skills.  However, no significant relationship was found between students vocational selfconcept and their career exploration skills. It was also found that career decisionmaking skills of planning, exploration and information processing bore significant correlations with one another.|Theses collection.|students' vocational selfconcept/parents' literacy status/ information processing/major ethnic groups/Faculties of Education*||||||Babajide, Ademola Deji|M|Psychological and Socio-Economic Correlates of Pensioner's Retirement-Life Satisfaction.||||||M.

Furthermore, the effects of some of pensioners' demographic and occupational variables on their retirementlife satisfaction were investigated.  The variables were age, gender, marital status, family type, living arrangement, nature of retirement, retirement income and length of time in retirement. The subjects of this study consisted of two hundred pensioners that were selected by purposive sampling from Oyo, Ondo and Lagos States.  Nine hypotheses were generated for the study.  The data were collected through the administration of the Demographic and Occupational Data Inventory (for subjects personal and occupational information) and eight other measures.  These measures were the RetirementLife Satisfaction Index (RLSI), the Financial Status Questionnaire (FSQ), the Social Participation and Interaction Questionnaire (SPIQ), the Residential Satisfaction Questionnaire (RSQ), the Health Status Questionnaire (HSQ), the Attitude Towards Death Questionnaire (ATDQ), the Relationship with Significant Others Questionnaire (RWSOQ) ind the Neighbourhood Satisfaction Questionnaire (NSQ). The resulting data were analysed using Pearson ProductMoment Correlation, Multiple Regression, OneWay Analysis of Variance (OneWay ANOVA) and ttest statistics.  All the hypothesis were tested at 0.05 level of significance.The results of the study indicated that retirementlife satisfaction was positively and significantly related to financial status (r = 0.50), social participation and interaction (r = 0.35), residential satisfaction (r = 0.38), health status (r = 0.39), relationship with significant others (r = 0.66) and neighbourhood satisfaction (r=0.39). However, it has no relationship with  attitude towards death.  Other results also indicated that when all the variables specified above were considered with regard to their predictability of retirementlife satisfaction, the combination of financial status, relationship with significant others and health status accounted for half of the predictable variance in retirementlife satisfaction     0.72). In addition, it was found that the only significant predictors of retirementlife satisfaction were financial status, relationship with significant others and health status.The results also showed that there was a significant difference between the retirementlife satisfaction of pensioners in the different age groups with those in the younger age categories having higher.near, retirementlife satisfaction scores than those in the older age categories.

Specifically, the study set out to examine the performance of the different categories of candidates who sat for JME and to assess the subsequent university academic performance of such students.  It also sought to compare the relative strength of the candidates entry qualifications as admission criteria. The study population consisted of 1,379 undergraduates randomly selected from the faculties of Arts, Education, Science, Social Sciences, Law and Pharmacy in three Nigerian universities.  The students were those in the 1987/88 and 1988/89 sets.  The JME scores, semester grade point averages (GPA's) and entry qualifications of the subjects were collected.For the 1987/88 set, GPA's were collected for the first three  semesters of undergraduate study while for the 1988/89 set GPA'S were collected for the first two semesters. The JME aggregate scores of the subjects were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA), while their GPA's were correlated with their JME aggregate scores, using Pearson ProductMoment Correlation method.  Intercorrelations were also carried out between the GPA'S. The results of the analyses revealed that there was a significant difference (P < 0.05) between entry qualifications and performance in JME composite for the 1987/88 set, and for the two sets combined, whereas there was no such significant difference for the 1988/89 set. It was also observed that there was a significant difference between entry qualifications and JME performance of the 1987/88 set in Arts (P < 0.05) and Science (P < 0.01), while there was such a significant difference (P < 0.05) for the 1988/89 set  in Social Sciences; but there was no significant difference in JME Performance of the students in Education, Law and Pharmacy for any of the sets.  The results further revealed a significant relationship between JME composite scores and university academic performance of the subjects (P < 0.001). This same result was observed in both sets and when the sets were combined.  Also, in each of the two sets of students, correlations between JME Total and Cumulative GPA (CGPA), JME English and CGPA, were lower than that between JME Total and JME English. Overall university academic performance of the students showed that first semester GPA's correlated significantly with other GPA's, the highest correlations were those between semester and cumulative GPA's, and JME Total correlated significantly with semester GPA'S.  Finally, the results showed that no entry qualification was superior to all others as an admission criterion for every selected course of study, and that JME aggregate score can predict a students academic performance during the first year of undergraduate study. The above findings showed that an examination or test result may tend to be unreliable when it is treated on the basis of a single testee, but proves reliable when treated on group basis.  The findings also showed that entry qualification is not a determining factor for a candidates performance in JME or in the university.|Theses collection.| Joint Matriculation Examination (JME)/ Nigerian universities/academic performance/admission criteria/undergraduates/grade point averages (GPA's)*||||||Ojo, Olugbenga David|M|Influence of Solo and Double Parenting on the Adjustment Problems of Secondary School Adolescents in Oyo State.||||||M.A.| 'Kemi Adamolekun.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi  Awolowo  University , Education Foudation and Counselling|1991|||OAU|||||ix, 87p||||||| English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

Adolescents' adjustment problems were studied under four groups.  These include social, family, personal and academic categories.                                                                                                                                                                                         The sample for the study consisted of 630 adolescents made up of randomly selected 480 adolescents from double parenthood and carefully and purposefully selected 150 adolescents from singleparenthood. The sample used were selected from ten secondary schools within three randomly selected local government areas of Oyo State.  A questionnaire designated Parental Influence on Adolescents' Behaviour Questionnaire (PIABQ) was used to collect data.  The data were analysed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and ttest at the 0.05 level of significance.The result indicated that the male and female adolescents from the two types of parenthood adjusted to social problem differently.  It was also revealed that the adolescents who are of double parenthood have a positive selfconcept.

It also determined whether subjects sex and levels of academic performance could influence the effects of group counselling in improving students study habits. The sample for the study consisted of forty J.S.S. II students from Omuaran High School in Kwara State. The students were divided into two experimental groups and a control group through random sampling. The performance of the subjects in English Language, Mathematics, Yoruba, Social Studies and Integrated Science as well as class position in a series of terminal examinations were used as measures of academic achievement. Equally, a study habit questionnaire was administered on all the students before and after the treatment to collect information on their study habits.  Ttest statistics was used to analyse the data collected. The level of significance was a significant difference between pretest and post test scores of the control and experimental groups regarding study habits (P < 0.05). In other words, the experimental groups improved considerably in their study habits after the counselling sessions.  On the other hand the control group did not improve in their study habits, (P > 0.05).Furthermore, post test scores of the control and experimental groups on study habits recorded a significant difference (P < 0.05). That is to say that there was a more noticeable improvement in study habits of the experimental groups than was the case in the control group when compared.  There was also an improvement between pre and post counselling class performance scores of the experimental groups (P < 0.05) while there was noticeable improvement in the control group (P > 0.05).  Finally, there was no significant difference in the performance level of male and female participants (P > 0.05). From these results, group counselling was found to be efficacious in bringing about an improvement on the study habits of secondary school students, with a resultant improvement in their grades.|Theses collection.|counselling/ secondary school students/sex /academic performance/English Language//study habits/experimental groups*||||||Olaosun, Victoria Adenike|F|Disciplinary Methods in Selected Secondary Schools and Homes in Oranmiyan Local Government Area.|||||| M.A|J.A.

It also investigated the perceptions of parents and students as to the effectiveness of these strategies. The study sample consisted of 850 subjects involving 500 students,  300 parents and 50 school teachers and principals.  They were selected by purposive and accidental sampling procedures. Three questionnaires were designed for the study, the Measure of Disciplinary Effectiveness as Perceived by Students (MDES), Measure of Disciplinary Effectiveness as Perceived by Parents (MDEP), and the Measures of Disciplinary Effectiveness as Perceived by School Authorities (MDESA), which were certified for validation by appropriate psychometric procedures.  These were administered personally by the researcher on the subjects over a period of six weeks.  The resulting data were analysed using percentage rankings. The result suggested that ten disciplinary methods were generally used by parents, namely caning and other forms of corporal punishment like "picking pins" refusal to give food, refusal to provide material needs (e.g. books, cloths, money etc.) lock out (lock the child outside the house), lock in (e.g. in a dark room, cupboard etc.) preventing the child from going to schools separating the child from playing with mates and compelling the child to work on the farm.  The most frequently used among the disciplinary methods by parents are caning, other forms of corporal punishment and separating the child from playing with mates while caning was rated highest as the most effective.The results also indicated that caning and asking students to cut grass were in all the selected schools the most common methods used by teachers to control indiscipline.  The results further revealed that these methods were in use in all schools, though they were not necessarily the most frequently used.  The most frequently used method by six (or 60%) of the schools is consulting with parents of offending students followed by caning and cutting grass.  The teachers also rated cutting grass as the most effective of the disciplinary methods.In conclusion, the study revealed that the students, parents and teachers did not share a common view on the most effective strategy to control indiscipline behaviour. Verbal reprimand had the highest ranking by students among the eighteen disciplinary methods used both at home and in the school.  The teachers rated cutting grass as the most effective while caning was rated highest by parents as the most effective of the disciplinary methods.|Theses collection.|strategies/teachers/ parents/ indiscipline behaviour /principals/disciplinary methods/ corporal punishment/offending students/*||||||Oyebisi, Elizabeth Oyepeju|F|Social Adjustment Problems and Academic Performance of Undergraduate Students of Obafemi Awolowo University.||||||M.A.|Kemi Adamolekun.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi  Awolowo  University , Education Foundation and Counselling|1991|||OAU|||||x, 115p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

Four areas of students lives that need adjustment such as the social psychological, school or residential, finance and social relationship problems were looked into.  These were used to identify the major social adjustment problems experienced by the students.The subjects for the study consisted of 306 second year students made up of 191 males and 115 females randomly selected from four faculties of two science and two humanities based courses. Four hypotheses were generated for the study and the Students Social Adjustment Problems Questionnaire (SSAPQ) was used to collect data for analysis.  The resulting data were analysed using mean standard deviation, percentages t-test and chi-square statistics.  All the hypotheses were tested at 0.05 level of significance.The results of the study indicated that students generally experienced social adjustment problems on campus especially during their first year, in that certain percentage of the students showed that they experienced each of the problems in the questionnaire.  Moreover, the results showed that the social adjustment problems being experienced by the males were not significantly different from those of the females, (P > 0.05).  Males showed greater superiority  than females in their academic performance at P < 0.05.  This showed that the female students were affected by the social adjustment problems than their male counterparts.  The result also showed that the students who adjusted well performed well academically than those who are poorly adjusted, (P < 0.05).  Furthermore, it was found that the adjustment coping mechanisms being employed by the females, (P > 0.05). The findings of this study showed that adequate counselling should be given to students during their orientation programme to help them make successful adjustment during their stay on campus.|Theses collection.|social adjustment problemsc/ademic performance/undergraduate students/Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife/social relationship/first year/female students*||||||Oyejide, Ayo Peters|M|Effects of confidence scoring procedures on the psychometric properties of three multiplechoice test formats.||||||M.A.| Ifedayo Afolabi.||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi  Awolowo  University        Education Foudation and Counsellig|1991|||OAU|||||xi, 140p.|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

By the psychometric property, is meant the validity, reliability, discrimination, and difficulty indices of the objective test formats used for the study.  The purpose of the study was to determine whether or not the above properties would be improved if the tests were scored by the confidence scoring method.  Four null hypotheses were thus postulated for testing.Subjects used for the study consisted of four hundred and fifty (450) Senior Secondary Two Students selected by purposive sampling from seven secondary schools in Ife North Local Government Area of Oyo State.  Questionnaires, (a 50-item achievement test in Mathematics and in three formats) were administered on the students as class test meant to be part of their continuos assessment for third term of 1990 academic year.The three formats of the test constructed were mixed and testees didn't know that they were answering different forms of the same test.  The test scripts were collected from the students and scored by the confidence scoring method.  Data obtained were analysed using the Pearson's product moment formula, Kude and Richardson's formula 20, Analysis of variance, t-test, and Z-ratio.Using CSP, the result showed that the contribution of blind guessing to testees total scores was inversely related to the validity, reliability, discrimination, and difficulty indices of the three formats of MC test used.  Hence CSP improved significantly the reliability and the difficulty indices of MC tests, but did not significantly improve the discrimination and validity indices of the three formats used, except the validity of the 3-alternative MC, all at 5% level of significance. This finding indicated that CSP rewards partial knowledge of testees on MC tests and was superior to the conventional number right scoring method in reducing the contribution of blind guessing to testees' total scores.|Theses collection.|confidence scoring procedure (CSP)/psychometric properties/multiple-choice (MC) test formats/ Senior Secondary*||||||Shobande, Bolaji Funmilayo|M| Social anxiety and academic performance of mainstreamed physically disabled secondary school students in Oyo state.||||||M.A. |A.

The main objective was to find out the effect of social anxiety on sex, health status, academic performance and age of the subjects.The sample for the study consisted of 200 senior secondary two students, comprising 80 physically disabled and 120 normal students, randomly selected from eight secondary schools. The subjects were classified into high, moderate and low anxious groups based on their scores in the social anxiety test.  A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on the students social anxiety levels.  Their performances in the promotion examination from senior secondary one to senior secondary two were collected from their various schools and used to classify them into high, moderate and low performance. In data analysis chisquares, Pearson Product  Moment Correlation, ttest, analysis of variance and Scheffe Posthoc statistical procedures were employed where appropriate. All hypotheses were tested at .05 level of significance. Findings indicated that the physically disabled student gave significantly higher anxiety levels than the nondisabled students (P < 0.05).  Among the physically disabled student, the female students were found to be more anxious than the male students (P < 0.05). The analysis of the data also showed a significant difference in the academic performance of low, moderate and highly anxious subjects (P < 0.05). It was found that while there existed a significant difference in the academic performance of low and highly anxious groups and moderate and highly anxious groups there was no significant difference in the academic performance of low and moderately anxious groups.  It was also found that there was an inverse relationship between the anxiety levels and academic performances of the subjects, The result also showed a significant relationship between subjects chronological ages and their anxiety levels.  Older subjects were more anxious than the younger ones.  This suggests that chronological age has a significant influence on the anxiety level of physically disabled children.|Theses collection.|social anxiety/academic performance /physically disabled students/ secondary schools in Oyo State/sex/health status/normal students/female students*||||||Jona, Ini Nka|F|An evaluation of sports education programmes for the handicapped pupils in selected primary schools in Western and Eastern states of Nigeria.||||||M.A.|E.B.

Specifically, the study examined the nature of sports education programmes, facilities and equipment, personnel, finance and problems affecting sports education programmes in the schools.One hundred and twenty subjects, 60 in Western States schools (group I) and 60 in Eastern State Schools (group II) were randomly selected from 20 schools for handicapped pupils in the states. The subjects consisted of 20 principals/heads of schools, 80 teachers and 20 technical staff. Data collected were analysed using percentages, mean scores and Chi-square where appropriate.The results indicated that the subjects generally agreed that physical education and recreation were compulsory subjects in the Curriculum for handicapped pupils. This was indicated by 94% and 84% of the subject, respectively.  Only 65% of the respondents indicated that intramural programmes were organised for the handicapped pupils in the schools, whereas 40% of the total subjects admitted that they organised extramural sports competition for the handicapped children.  Majority of the respondents (75%) indicated that the existing sports facilities, equipment and qualified sports personnel in the schools were inadequate.  Funding of sports programmes was rated as being inadequate by 90% of the subjects.  The most highly rated perceived values of sports education programmes for the handicapped pupils were social and character development, recreation, leisure and mental relaxation.

In effect the objectives of the study were to identify some of the factors contributing to students' difficulty with physics tasks requiring proportional reasoning skills and findings appropriate intervention strategies in order to improve their performance in physics.  Three ratio types (speed, exchange and consumption) and their hierarchy of difficulty were investigated for both familiar and unfamiliar problems were also identified.Three hundred students from twenty randomly selected secondary schools in Oyo State were used for the study. Their ages ranged from 14-18 years.  The data for the research were collected using three validated instruments. These are two forms (familiar and unfamiliar) of Proportional Reasoning Test (PRT), the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) and the Physics (proportional reasoning) Achievement Test (PAT). The data collected were analysed using the one-way ANOVA and 't'-Test statistical techniques.  All the results obtained were significant at 0.05 level of confidence.The results showed that ratio types used in physics problems influence the proportional reasoning ability of students.  Students found consumption ratios more difficult than exchange ratios and exchange ratios more difficult than speed ratios.  Also, students found physics tasks with unfamiliar settings more difficult than those with familiar settings.It was also observed that field independent students performed better than their field dependent counterparts on the physics (proportional reasoning) achievement test. In addition, the female students exhibited a lower proportional reasoning ability than their male counterparts.  The average proportional reasoning ability of the students used for the study was found to be generally low.|Theses collection.| problem context/cognitive style/gender/proportional reasoning ability/physics students/intervention strategies/consumption ratios/exchange ratios/speed ratios/ female students*||||||Adesoji, Francis Adewumi|M|A Comparative Analysis of Problem-Solving and SelfLearning Techniques in Teaching Electrolysis||||||Ph.D.|O.J.

The study also considered the effects of the methods on the subjects' attitude to the learning of Chemistry. Three hundred and sixty senior secondary class two chemistry students took part in the study. The subjects were divided into three ability groups (High,, Medium and Low) according to their performances in the pretest.  Each of these ability levels was contained in each of the three groups that is, Problem Solving Technique (PST), SelfLearning Technique (SLT) (Experimental Groups) and Lecture Method (IM) (Control Group).A chemistry achievement test and a questionnaire on students attitude towards chemistry were administered.  Seven hypotheses were raised and tested using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) and Scheffe test.  The results of the analysis showed that PST group scored higher in posttet (mean score, 57.2%) than either the SLT (mean score, 50.0%) or LM group (mean score, 38.8%).  As for the performance of subjects in the three ability groups, those in the PST group performed significantly higher than their counterparts in the SDT and LM groups (P < 0.05). Comparing the ability levels in each group, there was no significant difference in the performances of those in the PST and SLT groups (P > 0.05).

It also attempted to determine the extent to which school age, the gender of students in a school, and a schools location are factors influencing students' exposure to literatureinEnglish and  its relationship to their performance in English Language in the West African School Certificate Examination (ordinary level).The data for the study were certified West African School Certificate Examination results in English Language for three consecutive years (1985, 1986 and 1987) obtained from thirty schools randomly selected from five local Government Areas in Ondo State. The Study also reviewed previous researches published in standard texts and learned journals in the area of curriculum studies and language arts.  The analytical techniques used in the study were the ttest and the ChiSquare methods of statistical analysis. The result of the study indicated that secondary schools performance in English language in the West African School Certificate Examination was better when they also offered literature in English than when they offered English language alone.  It was also found out that students who attended older schools, coeducational schools, and urban schools, and offered both literaturein English and English language performedbetter in school certificate examination in English Language, than those who offered the two subjects in relatively younger schools, monosex schools and rural schools, respectively. From these findings, the thesis concluded that secondary school students' performance in English Language could be enhanced if LiteratureinEnglish is made compulsory for all of them.It was further concluded that while only qualified teachers should be employed to teach English in all schools, library facilities and cocurricular literary activities should be provided in all secondary schools.|Theses collection.|secondary school students/LiteratureinEnglish/ english Language/school age/gender of students/ schools location/West African School Certificate Examination (ordinary level)/Ondo State/ coeducational schools/urban schools*||||||Afolayan, Moradeke|M|Attitudes of Ife and Ilesa Communities towards the use of Mother Tongue as a Medium of Instruction for Nursery Education||||||M.A|G.J.

It also investigated the language currently being used in nursery schools and identified discrepancy between policy and practice.  Finally, reasons for this discrepancy were examined.The study sample comprised seven hundred and nine  subjects selected by stratified random procedure. It was made up of 500 parents, 180 teachers, 20 language  experts and 9 educational administrators from the Oyo State Ministry of Education.  There were three research instruments used in this study.  These were a questionnaires an observation guide, and an interview guide.  The instruments were personally administered by the investigator.  Subsequently, the data collected were analysed and used to answer the four research questions corresponding to the objectives of the study. Descriptive and inferential statistics including the means,  percentages and chisquare techniques were used for the analysis of the research questions. The results of the analyses strongly indicated that there were a general preference (76.92%) for the use of English as the language of instruction in the nursery schools contrary to the intentions of the National Policy on Education.  It was also shown that the reasons for the preference for English primarily included envisaged advantages accruing to pupils in areas of future academic opportunity and performance financial and employment advantages, and prestige. Further more, the study indicated that, since parents expected their children to benefit much from early learning of English, they pressured the nursery school authorities to adopt English medium.  Finally, it was observed from the study that the practice of adopting English medium was, by and larger similar in both Ife and Ilesa communities. |Theses collection.| Ife and Ilesa communities/mother tongue/medium  of instruction/preprimary classrooms/National Policy on Education (1977-1981)/nursery schools/educational administrators/Oyo State Ministry of Education/research instruments*||||||Akinwumi, lsaac Oyedele|M|Effectiveness of Feedback Remedial Measure in the Learning of Secondary School Physics. |||||| Ph.D|A.A.

The methods were Specific Feedback Remedial (SFR). Specific Feedback Only (SFO) and the Conventional Method (CM).  Effectiveness was determined by the level of performance of subjects that were exposed to each method.  Attitude modifications in subjects that were exposed to the three methods were also compared. Four hundred and eighty senior secondary one (SS 1) students  were randomly selected to constitute the sample. Group  based instructional package on the concept of motion was constructed based on physics SSS Syllabus by CESAC.  Specific remedial packages were also constructed to enable subjects which were deficient in certain areas of each week's work to remediate for such deficiencies.  The subjects concerned used the specific remedial packages as self learning devices. The instruments developed and validated for the study were the cognitive pretest, postachievement test, diagnostic test, and attitude towards physics scale. After independent induction sections, teachers assigned to the SFR and SFO groups used the Groupbased instructional package to teach the concept of motion to subjects in the two groups for a period of nine weeks.  At the end of each week, the SFR and SFO teachers administered a diagnostic test on the subjects in the SFR and SFO groups.  Feedback was also provided.  Subjects in the SFR and SFO groups were thus able to detect areas where specific learning difficulties existed.  Subjects in the SFR group were given specific remedial packages to correct specific learning difficulties while subjects in the SFO group were not given such packages. The subjects in the CM group were taught the concept of motion using the lecture method.  The group did not have the weekly diagnostic tests and specific remedial packages.  The attitude towards physics scale was administered on all the subjects in the groups namely SFR, SFO, CM and CON which was the control, before the pretest was given.  The same attitude towards physics scale was also administered after the posttest was given.  The data collected were statistically analysed using mean scores, ANOVA, ANCOVA, Scheffe's pair-wise comparison test and multiple ttests.The results showed that the SFR individuals performed higher in a physics achievement test (per cent mean gain in score 46.00%) than the SFO (29.49%) and the CM group (10.00%). The results of the ACOVA showed that the SFR group performed significantly higher in  the Physics achievement test than the SFO and the CM groups   (P < 0.01).  Results of the ANCOTA also showed that the SFT group performed significantly higher in a Physics retention test than the SFO and the CM groups (P < 0.01). The subjects in the SFR group cultivated a more positive attitude towards physics than the subjects in the SFO and the CM groups as revealed by ANOVA test ( P < 0.01). Performance of boys and girls were comparable in the SFR group while boys performed higher than girls in the SFO and CM groups. (P < 0.01).

In order to achieve these objectives, preliminary discussions, questionnaires, field surveys and laboratory tests were carried out.  A total of 142 questionnaires were administered among the current users of such buildings, experts in construction wood technology, insurance, finance, fire and local government authorities. Prototype low cost houses using timber and block work designed by Oyo State Development and Property Corporation were costed and the costs compared.In order to determine cogent factors as identified by respondents for various issues, percentage of occurrence and ranking were used as demarcation factors.  Analysis of variance and student ttest were used to test various data obtained to determine their reliability.  For cost analysis, bills of quantities were prepared for the low cost houses using various materials and sent for costing to a firm of chartered quantity surveyors.The results showed that timber buildings can be viable alternatives to other types of buildings currently in use in Nigeria because of the materials, the cost and the service ability of the current timber buildings for various uses in south western Nigeria.  However, the cost analysts showed that as the quality of timber houses decreased so also did the cost, and that a standard timber building was likely to be more expensive than the conventional block wall building.The study concluded that despite the great potential timber building possess, its mass introduction concluded into the housing stock may face several hindrances including stock of hardwood, absence of bylaws supporting timber house construction and several others.  Recommendations on public education, development of building codes regulating timber buildings and adoption of timber buildings in public house were also made.|Theses collection.|timber building/construction wood technology/insurance/finance/fire/local government authorities/ Prototype low cost houses/Oyo State Development and Property Corporation/ stock of hardwood/f bylaws/timber house construction*||||||Kehinde, Stephen Olufemi|M|Strategies for competitive bidding in the construction industry in south west Nigeria||||||M.Sc.| O.

However, all the contractors sampled were in Category D, with 65%, of them having up to 1,500 workers while the rest had between 1,500 to 3,000 workers. Fifty percent of the clients, 70% consultants and 41% contractors preferred selective tendering over all the other forms but majority of the indigenous contractors preferred open tendering.  It was found that there was no scientific approach to bidding in the construction industry in the South West Nigeria. Further, while 70% of consultants preferred to prequalify contractors,  87% of the contractors preferred lobbying the clients or the consultants.  The success rate of tendering for large foreign contractors was 65.5% while that of large indigenous contractors was only 30%.  It was also discovered that clients were the final decision makers; 70% of them always participate in the final selection of the contractor and often but not always use the recommendations of their consultant.  Finally, it was discovered that the majority of tenders submitted differed only in the level of markup used and that the markups of the indigenous contractors were lower than those of the foreigners, varying between 16% to 41% for indigenous and between 28% to 52% for foreign contractors.However, tender sum and technical competence ranked highest in the selection of a contractor for a job.  Two models for competitive tender (for known and unknown competitors respectively), employing factors of probability, markup and the level of interest of the contractors were developed and tested using the tender information supplied by the clients consultants.  The results of the model testing indicated that the models were between 80% to 83% successful where the contractor is highly interested, 20% to 50% successful when he is an averagely interested bidder and 0% to 17% when he is an indifferent bidder.  It was concluded that the models satisfactorily predicted the changes of successful tendering in the Nigerian construction industry.  The need for interpersonal relationships cannot, however be entirely ignored.|Theses collection.|construction firms/south west Nigeria/consulting firms/contractors/ indigenous and multinational companies/construction industry/foreign contractors *||||||Akinola, Shittu Raimi|M| Comparative study of mass transit system in Oyo and Kwara States,  Nigeria||||||M.Sc|S.

The study of recreational potentials of Lekki Beach was aimed at evaluating the physical characteristics of the beach, its level of development and its recreational roles in Lagos State.  A field survey approach was adopted to assess the physical characteristics and level of provision of recreational facilities and to determine the users' recreational habits and demands at Lekki Beach. Also, relevant data were obtained through personal interviews of officials of Lagos Island Local Government and Ministry of Home Affairs and Tourism, Lagos State.  Statistical analytical techniques including frequency distribution, crosstabulation and multiple regression were employed to analyse the data to realise the various aims of the study.Analyses of physical survey data showed that Lekki Beach was highly underdeveloped despite its great potentials for recreational activities.  The beach was blessed with scenic landscapes with natural cool breezes, fine clean sands and relatively welldrained environment which can enhance the development of recreational facilities on a large scale and thus encourage tourism tremendously. Analyses of the recreational habits of the visitors to Lekki Beach showed that the beach was used for the following activities: swimming (51.1%); sunbathing (33.6%); dancing (33.3%); horse riding (29.9%); picking of shells (27.4%); informal football (25.1%) and resting/games (12.4%).Further analysis showed that the attraction of the beach and the activities pursued were influenced by the socio-economic factors of the visitors, their nationality, whether they come from Lagos State, the male and female population and the problems encountered by the visitors.  A further critical examination of these factors showed that Lekki Beach has proved to be very attractive to the visitors especially male population and foreigners. The problems facing the visitors in order of importance were transportation, distance, finance and difficulty in locating the beach. Other problems identified were lack of adequate management, inadequate funding and lack of recreational facilities, car parking, adequate security, social amenities and adequate landscapes, sanitation around beaches. The visitors to the beach were making demands on convenient station (70.3%), canteen/restaurant (60.5%), children play ground/amusement park (51.8%), hotel accommodation (50.3%), parking facilities/security 46.0%), landscaping (44.1%), picnic ground (41.2%, swimming pool (39.0%) and boating (38.2%).|Theses collection.|demand and supply/recreational facilities/Lekki Beach /Lagos State/Lagos Island Local Government/ Ministry of Home Affairs and Tourism, Lagos State/male population /foreigners/ hotel accommodation/parking facilities/security /picnic ground*||||||Ogbuefi,  Linus Ifeabunike|M|Planning and management of open spaces in Enugu.||||||M.Sc. |J.B.

The method of study embraced three interrelated approaches. Firstly, a structured questionnaire survey of park users in Enugu was undertaken in order to determine what activities they are engaged in and their perceptions of the problems of park management.  Secondly, members of staff of Open Space and Park Development and Planning Department were interviewed to determine problems encountered in the management of parks in Enugu.  Thirdly, a physical survey of existing parks in Enugu was conducted to gain a first hand information on problems of these parks.The analysis of the survey of the parks in Enugu shows that Uwani had the highest concentration of parks (36%). Thus, the study demonstrated was because land areas set aside for parks in the original plan of Enugu have not been encroached on before Open Space Development Commission launched its action plan on the development of parks in Enugu in 1973.The study showed that youth visit parks more than the adults (88.9%) and the purpose of their visit is mainly for personal relaxation.  The analysis showed that the problem of parks in Enugu was largely poor maintenance (84.9%). Thus, the study demonstrated was due to inadequate funding and shortage of manpower.The transfer of the functions and personnel of the Open Space Development Commission to Anambra State Environmental and Sanitation Authority was a major contributory factor to the relative ineffectiveness of the Department since 1985.  Despite the problems confronting the Open Space and Park Department, most visitors to the parks (72.7%) still believed that parks are highly valuable and, therefore, the organizational and financial problems should be resolved by the state government.|Theses collection.|planning and management/problems of parks in Enugu/Open Space and Park Development and Planning Department/personal relaxation/poor maintenance/inadequate funding/shortage of manpower.*||||||Omole, Kofoworola Olutoyin|M|The study of passenger patronage of rail transport mode in Nigeria.||||||M.Sc.|S.

The study is based on relevant information collected from the literature and the Nigerian Railway Corporation.  Also questionnaire survey of passengers was administered to elicit information on the socio-economic and travel characteristics of the patrons, travel pattern of the train users, passenger service and train operations. The analysis of the passenger service and its operations, shows that train scheduling, frequency of service and fare structure have been changing and influencing the volume of passengers.Analysis of the socioenonomic characteristics, shows that the patrons are mostly single selfemployed traders with a maximum of secondary school education.  In the travel pattern analysis, it was confirmed that the train services, though very slow, are safer and cheaper than other modes.  These attributes often attract patrons. The patrons are mostly noncar owners hence the reliance on public transport to access the station is high. The analysis also showed that NRC faces many problems including lack of sufficient and reliable locomotives to operate the trains, lack of supply of efficient facilities on board, organisational bottleneck, security problems and low quality of train services.  The implications of research finding for running efficient rail passenger services are discussed.|Theses collection.|Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC)/patronage/Western Division/train users/passenger service/train operations/selfemployed traders/secondary school education*||||||Irinoye, Omolola Oladunni|F|Congruency between expected roles and actual role performance of nurses in surgical units of a teaching hospital.||||||M.Sc.|A.

It also examined the extent of actual performance of such elicited roles by nurses in the wards.  Congruency in the rating of such performance by patients, nurses, and other members of the health care team on the wards was also examined.  The performance rating of the nurses was used to evaluate the adequacy of performance of elicited roles in surgical wards of Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, IleIfe.A questionnaire of 55items, tested for reliability and validity was used to collect data from study sample. Purposive sampling was done to select 140 subjects comprising 60 nurses, 40 patients, 40 members of the health care team from the 8 surgical wards of the teaching hospital.  Data collected were analysed, using frequency counts, percentages and, chisquare test to assess for statistically significant differences in the group of performances and detect congruency in the rating.The study revealed that there was no difference between the elicited professional roles of the nurse, the nurses' perception of their roles, and the patients expected roles of the nurses and the actual roles that were being performed by nurses in the surgical wards of the teaching hospital. However, it was found that there was a statistically significant difference between the health care team members' roles expectation of the nurse and the actual performance of such roles by nurses in the surgical wards of the hospital. lt was found that there were statistically significant differences in the 3 groups rating of nurses performance of the 11 roles elicited.  Hence there were no congruency in the groups rating of the performance of the 11 roles.                      The study demonstrated that clients and health care team members' role expectation of the nurses in surgical wards were not different from the expected roles of the professional nurse in such units, but there was a difference between what was expected and what was actually done.  Therefore, strategies to improve the nurses' abilities to adequately play their roles to meet up with the expectations of consumers and other team members in the surgical units should be given top priority.|Theses collection.|nurses/surgical units/teaching hospital/patients/health care team members/doctors and physiotherapists/Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, IleIfe/congruency*||||||Pungong, Jacqueline Ndientien|F| Effects of exercise intensity on the cardiorespiratory responses of athletes and nonathletes in Nigeria.||||||M.Sc.| I.

It is thus necessary to identify factors which determine high levels of fitness and athletic excellence of Nigerian subjects. This study was designed to investigate the effect of exercise intensity on the cardiorespiratory response to exercise of anaerobically-trained athletes and nonathletes in Nigeria. The relationships between anthropometric parameters (sex, height, weight and body surface area) and the cardiorespiratory variables were also investigated.Thirtyone nonathletes and anaerobicallytrained athletes within the age range of 1634 years participated in the study.  A 2 (sex) x2(activity levels) x4 (exercise intensity) experimental design was employed.  Subjects signed a consent form prior to the test.  On the test day, the height, weight and body surface area were measured after which the subject was asked to lie supine and the heart rate and blood pressure were monitored for about 30 minutes until a constant value was obtained.  The subject was then asked to sit upright on a bicycle ergometer and the resting cardiorespiratory functions were monitored for 5 minutes.  Exercises of 0, 1.5 and 3.0 Kp at 60 revolutions per minute for at most 5 minutes were prescribed for each subject with resting periods of 1520 minutes between the exercise intensities.Heart rate (HR) was monitored with a multipurpose poly graph while systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were monitored with a sphygmomanometer and stethoscope on the left arm.  Closedcircuit spirometry was used to monitor respiratory frequency (Rf), tidal volume (VT),  minute ventilation (VE) and rate of oxygen uptake (VO2).  To confirm VO2  measurements, the Fry's gas analyser was used for analysis of expired gas samples collected in Douglas bags. The analysis of variance for each cardiorespiratory variable was done at the Shephard Computer Centre, Ibadan.There was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the cardiorespiratory functions after exercise except for DBP and VT which showed a decrease at 1.5Kp and 3.0Kp exercise respectively.  A significant (P < 0.05) difference occurred between the male and female HR, DBP, Rf and VO2 responses to exercise.  The VT at rest and 0Kp of anaerobicallytrained athletes and non athletes were found to be significantly (P < 0.05) different.  Height, weight and body surface area were found to have a significant relationship (P < 0.05) with HR, VT, Rf and VO2.  The cardiorespiratory variables were found to be highly related both at rest and at different exercise intensities.The experimental design employed in this study was for found to be more suitable for low intensity shortduration exercises.  The anaerobicallytrained athletes and nonathletes showed no significant difference in their functions indicating that the anaerobicallytrained athletes had not been training as necessary (aerobically). It is therefore necessary for Nigerian subjects to train regularly, making use of necessary gadgets.  During Medical Checkups, subjects should be prescribed different exercise intensities and their cardiorespiratory functions monitored.|Theses collection.|cardiorespiratory functions / foreign population/Nigerian subjects/athletic excellence/anaerobically-trained athletes/anthropometric parameters/heart rate/blood pressure/bicycle ergometer/Closedcircuit spirometry/ respiratory frequency (Rf)/ tidal volume (VT)/minute ventilation (VE)/oxygen uptake (VO2)/Medical Checkups*||||||Bakare, Omokafe ALaba|M|Comparative anatomy of the species of sida linn.

(Malvaceae) in Nigeria was carried out with a view to using these features along with other vegetative morphological features, to work out an identification and classification scheme for the species. Fresh as well as herbarium were used in the study of ten taxa while herbarium specimens only were used for S. ovata, S. rhombifolia subsp. rhombifolia and S. acuta subsp. carpinifolia.  The plant specimens were prepared for anatomical study by employing conventional anatomical procedures.The species possess distinctive anatomical characters which indicate close inter-relationship.  These features include the presence of both glandular and non-glandular trichomes; 4-6 collateral vascular bundles arranged in a circle as seen in the transverse section of petiole through the proximal region, while the vascular system is of close medulated type through the distal region of the petiole; anisocytic stomata; dorsiventral lamina; crystals which are druses of calcium oxalate; rays which are homogeneous, being upright cells; and fibres which are tracheid-like, commonly non-septate, non-storied and short in length.Some significant differences were observed in the anatomical characters that could be used to characterize each species.  For instance, the trichome types when assessed critically were used to distinguish some species from the others, viz: the stellate trichomes were recorded for all the species except for S. Linifolia where they were absent.  Columnar trichomes were observed in S. cordifolia, S. urens, and S. linifolia.  The flask-shaped trichomes were found in all the species except in S. linifolia, S. pilosa, S. urens and S. cordifolia.The anatomical evidence observed in this study supported the reduction of S. acuta and S. stipulata to S. acuta subsp. acuta and S. acuta subsp. carpinifolia respectively.  However, the previous taxonomic decision to split the S. rhombifolia complex into subspecies: S. rhombifolia subsp. alnifolia, S. rhombifolia subsp. rhombifolia and S. rhombifolia subsp. retusa was not supported on anatomical grounds in this investigation.  The morphological and anatomical features have been used to construct a workable artificial key.|Theses collection.|comparative anatomical study/vegetative morphological features/plant specimens/inter-relationship/non-glandular trichomes/collateral vascular bundles/anisocytic stomata/dorsiventral lamina//crystals/ calcium oxalate/homogeneous/species/artificial key*||||||Effiong, Nnene Mfon|M|Seasonal Changes in Gibberellic Acid and Abscisic Acid Content in three Tropical Rice Varieties.||||||M.Sc.|A.

The aim of the study was first to explore the relationship between the growth phases and the hormonal levels in the rice varieties and secondly to investigate the relationship which may exist between the flowering of these plants and the local daylength prevalent in IleIfe.Acidic ethyl acetate fraction of the extract obtained from homogenizing the plant material was assayed by lettuce hypocotyl bioassay for gibberellic acid and diethyl ether fraction assayed by lettuce germination bioassay for abscisic acid.  The solvent system isopropanol: water (4:1 v/v) and benzene: ethyl acetate: acetic acid (75:20:5v/v/v) were used in the bioassay for gibberellic acid and abscisic acid respectively.  The height, internode lengths and fresh weights of the plants were also measured.The results showed the occurrence of gibberellic acid at Rf 0.50.9 and abscisic acid at Rf 0.3-0.7. TOS 6012 took 128 days to flower after seeding while TOS 5771 and TOS 9186 took 116 days and 113 days to flower after seeding respectively.  TOS 5771 reached a height of 123.4  13.20 cm at maturity followed by TOS 9186 with 117.4  7.15 cm and TOS 6012 with 102.95  0.85 cm.  TOS 6012 produced more tillers than the other two rice varieties.  The gibberellinlike activity was found to be high during the seedling stage for all the three rice varieties with TOS 5771 having the highest amount (11.04 umole/kg fresh weight) and TOS 6012, the lowest (2.46 umole/kg fresh weight).  The level of the hormone dropped during internode elongation and remained low till maturity. The abscisic acid level in the three rice varieties showed no regular pattern.  Differences in daylength between Shendam in Plateau State and IleIfe is taken to be the reason for the delay in maturity of TOS 60l2.|Theses collection.|gibberellinlike substances/abscisic acid/tropical rice / growth phases/hormonal levels/internode elongation/maturity*||||||Esenowo, Godwin Johnson.|F|A study of lipid flux and hormonal balance in corypha palm during heat treatment for dormancy break||||||Ph.D.|A.C.

The aims of this research were to determine the effects of interaction of heating and soaking on seed dormancy, the relationship between lipid and hormonal levels and breaking of dormancy.Dormancy was broken by heating the seeds in the oven at 42oC for 110 weeks and soaked between 12 and 72 hours before planting.  Lipids were extracted from the seeds with chloroformmethanol (2: 1 v/v), separated by silicic acid column and thin layer chromatography (T.L.C.) and quantified by gas liquid chromatography (G.L.C.).  Gibberellin and abscisic acid were extracted with 80% methanol, purified by polyvinylpyrridone column and thin layer chromatography.  The T.L.C. developing solvent system for gibberellin was isopropanolwater (4: 1 v/v), while it was benzene: ethylacetateacetic acid (75: 20: 5 v/v) for abscisic acid.  Cytokinins were extracted with methanolwater-formic acid, separated by ion exchange chromatography and T.L.C. plates developed with butanolacetic acidwater (12: 3: 5 v/v/v).  Lettuce hypocotyl and lettuce germination bioassays were used to determine the activities of ethyl acetate and butanol-soluble gibberellins acid diethyl ethersoluble abscisic acid.  Soybean callus bioassay was used to determine the activities of water, ammonia and ethanolsoluble cytokinins.  Both percentage and days of germination were analysed with two way analysis of variance and Student's ttest.Heat treatment for 10 weeks and soaking for 24 hours increased the percentage seed germination to 77 and reduced the days of germination from 44 to 26. The dormant seed contained 12.5% lipids while the nondormant ones contained between 7.5 and 9.0%. Five classes of lipids obtained from the Corypha seeds were triglycerides, diglycerides, free fatty acid, cholesteryl esther and sterol.  The fatty acids were myristic, linolenic, palmitic, oleic, stearic and lauric acids.  There was complete disappearance of glycolipids and a drop in fatty acid level in the 10th week of heating of non-dormant seeds. The results of the bioassays shored that the hormone activities occurred mainly at Rf values 0.10.2, 0.30.5, and 0.70.9 for cytokinins, 0.00.3, 0.40.7 and 0.81.0 for gibberellins and 0.40.5 for abscisic acid.  The dormant seeds contained a high level of abscisic acid and a low level of basic ethyl acetate solublegibberellins.  During dormancy break, the level of abscisic acid declined while basic ethyl acetatesoluble gibberellins rose to a peak on the 4th week and then dropped on the 10th week.  Low levels of watersoluble and ammoniasoluble cytokinins were identified in the dormant seeds.  After dormancy break, both levels increased and maximum germination was triggered off.Sephadex LH20 chromatography of the isolated cytokinins revealed an increase in ammoniasoluble extract concomitant decrease in water soluble extract in the 10th week, thus suggesting interconversion of these hormones after dormancy break.

The studies also aimed at investigating the pattern of re-vegetation by bryophytes in the periodically disturbed ecosystem of the savanna.Monthly soil samples were collected from the sites over a 12month period and analysed in the laboratory for exchangeable cations (sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium), nitrate nitrogen, moisture contents pH and organic matter content.  Soil temperatures of the sites were measured during the same period and related to vegetation growth to monitor effect on bryophyte growth.  Percentage cover, vegetative and reproductive growth of bryophytes were measured onsite over a 24month period using 20cm x 20cm permanent quadrats.  Moss shoots were subjected to water stress under controlled environment and at various relative humidities.The studies showed that the mosses present on the sites were Archidium ohioense, Bryum coronatum, Fissidens minutifolius,   F. subglaucissimus and Trachycarpidium tisserantii on derived savanna vegetation.  These mosses were more heat resistant than the forest moss species (Thuidium gratum and Racopilum africanum).  The species ordination on study sites showed Archidium ohioense as the most dominant species.  The topography of the sites aids runoff of rainwater and thus encourage leaching of nutrients across the slopes.  Nitrate nitrogen, pH, Sodium, Potassium and Magnesium and water were found to be the key soil factors that contributed individually to the varied distribution of the moss species on the sites.  The moss shoots exhibited a characteristic sigmoid growth curve commencing with the advent of the rainy season in March/April with accelerated growth phase in midrainy seasons, reaching a climax in September/October, the end of the rainy season. The adaptations for survival of the mosses include the ability to complete their reproductive and vegetative stages within the rainy season and their ability to regenerate profusely through gemmae, tubers, persistent protonema and shoot regrwoth.  The annual grass burning on the sites aids in the recycling of nutrients for the use of bryophytes and phanerogams during subsequent growth season.|Theses collection.|seasonal variations/bryophyte population/Derived Savanna vegetation/SouthWestern Nigeria/re-vegetation /exchangeable cations/Soil temperatures/relative humidities/adaptations*||||||Tedela, Olugbenga Patrick|M|Anatomical Studies of the Species of Pterocarpus Jacq.

The vegetative anatomy of the six species of Pterocarpus viz:  P. santalinoides, P. mildbraedii,  P. osun,  P. erinaceus, P. soyauxii and P. lucens occuring in Nigeria were studied and described with the view to finding the anatomical features which may be employed along with other features for the identification and classification of the species in the genus.Fresh plant materials collected from different parts of Nigeria and herbarium specimens kept in the harbaria of Obafemi Awolowo University, IleIfe and Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria (FRIN), Ibadan were used for the study.  Transverse sections of the leaf and petiole as well as the transverse radial and transverse longitudinal sections of the wood were made using the sledge microtome.  Calculation of the stomata frequency, stomata index and guard cell area were determined from epidermal peels of both adaxial and abaxial surfaces of the leaves.Results show that the anatomical features which can be used to define the genus are paracytic stomata occurring only on the abaxial surface; unicellular, needle-like and non-glandular trichome ocurring only on the lower surface; Camptodromous venation, diffuse porous wood with growth rings; oval to elliptic solitary vessels which may occur in radial multiples of 2 and 3; storied rays which are predominantly uniseriate and homogenous and wood that is characterised by abundant parenchyma.P. santalinoides is distinct from some others in the absence of trichome on the petiole, the parenchyma that is apotracheal and the presence of up to 4 to 8 subsidiary cells around most of its stomata.  P. mildbraedii is characterized by the absence of trichome on the abaxial leaf surface, adaxial part of the midrib that is slightly raised into a smooth mound, and midrib outline in transverse section that is more or less triangular.  P. osun is distinct in that the walls of the abaxial epidermal cells are wavy while the adaxial surfaces vary from straight to slightly wavy.  P. erinaceus is characterized by the moderate distribution of trichome on the abaxial leaf surface.  P. soyauxii is characterized by an adaxial xylem strand in the midrib of the leaf.  P. lucens has some distinct anatomical features such as abundant distribution of trichome on the abaxial leaf surface and a distinct stomata index.|Theses collection.|vegetative anatomy/species of Pterocarpus/anatomical features/Obafemi Awolowo University, IleIfe/Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria (FRIN), Ibadan/transverse longitudinal sections/Camptodromous venation/abaxial leaf surface*||||||Ajayi, Oluwole Lucas|M|Determination of radionuclides in building materials used in some Nigerian dwellings.||||||M.Sc.| J.

This was with a view to obtaining preliminary data on the radioactivity levels of 238U, 232Th and 40K in some building materials, such as cement, rock, sand, burnt brick and asbestos. Samples were collected from towns covering seven states suspected to contain low or high terrestrial activity levels by using scintillation counter for onthespot monitoring.  The samples were reduced to grain size, oven dried at about 110oC for 24 hours and sealed for a minimum of 28 days before counting at the Nuclear Physics Laboratory of the Department of Physics, Obafemi Awolowo University, lleIfe.  This is to allow a stage of secular equilibrum between 238U , 232Th and their daughter series.Photopeaks at 0.609 MeV, 1.12 Mev and 1.764 MeV of 214Bi were used to identify 238U; 0.911 Mev of 228AC and 2.615 MeV of 208TI  were used to identify 232Th and natural potassium, 40K, was identified with its 1.461 MeV x-energy. The average specific activities of 238U, 232Th and 40K in cement, rock, sand, burnt brick and asbestors ranged from 182.7 to 301.7 Bq Kg-1, 86.0 to 211.3 Bq Kg-1 and 141.5 to 646.6 Bq Kg-1 respectively. Comparison with similar work done in some other countries reveals that some activity levels which could the considered average occurred in cement and asbestos while activity levels were high in rocks, sand and burnt bricks suggesting that activity levels of our building materials need thorough investigation before they can be used for building construction.|Theses collection.|radionuclides/building materials/NaI(TI) detector/radioactivity levels/ scintillation counter/onthespot monitoring/Nuclear Physics Laboratory of the Department of Physics, Obafemi Awolowo University, lleIfe*||||||Ocan, Onesmus Ojok|M|The Petrology of Rocks around Idanre, SouthWestern Nigeria.||||||Ph.D. |M.

The area is underlain by the migmatitic gneiss complex (consisting of grey gneisses of tonalitic to granodioritic composition, granite gneisses, finegrained granites and minor pegmatites, vein quartz, amphibolites and ultramafic rocks), members of the Older Granite Suite and the associated charnockitic rocks.  The present work was aimed at investigating the granitecharnockite association and to determine the petrogeneses of the rock units of the area.Field mapping and petrographic analyses of the collected samples were carried out in order to determine the contact relations between rock groups, their texture and mineral compositions.  A total of 136 specimens were analysed for their major and trace element compositions by XRay Fluorescence Spectrometry technique (13 grey gneisses, 13 amphibolites and ultramafic rocks, 34 charnockitic rocks and 76 granitic rocks).  The geochemical data were plotted on different variation diagrams in order to characterize them and determine their petrogeneses.  Critical minerals in gneissose charnockitic rocks were analysed by electron microprobe analytical techniques and the results were used in geothermobarometric computations to determine the physical conditions under which they formed. UPb isotopic analyses of zircons extracted from granites and charnockitic rocks were used to date the emplacement of the granitecharnockite association.Results of the analyses indicate that grey gneisses, theoldest recognisable member of the migmatite gneiss complex are of sedimentary origin.  The other components of the migmatite are of igneous origin.  The granites and charnockites are late to posttectonic metaluminous to slightly peraluninous rocks characterized by high amounts of K2O and high field strength elements.  They form a composite diapiric intrusion of mantlederived magmas, emplaced about 586  5 Ma ago.The evolution of the area started about 2500 Ma ago with the initiation  of crustforming processes characterized by magnetism of tonalitic to granodioritic composition.  Rapid erosion of this juvenile crust resulted in the deposition of immature sediments (greywackes) and minor basic volcanics. Metamorphism and deformation of this sequence and emplacement of granites during the Eburnean orogeny 2000  200 Ma ago resulted in the formation of the migmatitic gneiss complex. This basement was reactivated and intruded by granitic and charnockitic rocks shortly after the continentcontinent collision at the eastern margin of the West African Craton about 600 Ma ago.|Theses collection.|Idanre area/ Nigerian Basement Complex/ PanAfrican mobile belt/West African Craton/Congo Craton/migmatitic gneiss complex/petrogeneses/ mineral compositions/ sedimentary origin/Field mapping /perographic analyses/Fluorescence Spectrometry technique/geochemical data/basic volcanics.*||||||Idornigie, Alexander Irumekhai.|M|A study of the use of resistivity type curves for groundwater development in Edu local governmnet area of Kwara State.||||||M.Sc. |M.

This is with a view to identifying the different aquifer units and their characteristics; the subsurface structures/tectonics and their influence on the general hydrogeological conditions in the area. The qualitative interpretation of resistivity type curves resulting from 54 Vertical Electrical Soundings (VES) revealed that simple type curves (e.g. H, HA, KH types) are reflective of the Basement Complex area, while complex type curves (e.g. HK, QHK, KQQ types) are indicative of sedimentary parts of the study area.  The type curves, based on distinctive geoelectric and geologic characteristics, were classified into four groups.From the quantitative interpretation of the sounding curves aided by lithological logs from the boreholes, a maximum of four layers were identified from the Basement Complex area. These include the top soil, sand/pebbly sand/clayey sand layer, the weathered basement and the fresh bedrock.  In the sedimentary environment, the number of layers recorded ranged between four and seven.  The sequence is composed of complex alternations of gravel, sand/pebbles/clay and sandstones.  The depth to the fresh bedrock in the basement area is between 7.4m and 91.6m. The bedrock was not mapped in the sedimentary environment.The geoelectric sections taken along five different traverses in the study area indicate that there are two sets of faults. One set (faults F1 and F2) runs almost parallel to the River Niger in the NWSE direction, while the other set (F3 and F4) runs at high angle to the first set, and trends approximately in the NESW direction.  Faults F1 and F2 whose downthrown sides are towards the NE     seems to break up the study area into three blocks or zones with different hydrogeologic characteristics.  The first zone which is mainly underlain by basement rocks lies to the South of fault F1, while the second zone which constitutes the transitional zone between the basement and sedimentary rocks lies between faults F1 and F2.  The third zone lies to the North of fault F2 and it is predominantly underlain by sedimentary rocks.  This third zone has the thickest overburden with a relatively high groundwater yield. The physiographic elements, such as rivers and topography, in this area seem to be structurally controlled.From the available geoelectric data, it is hereby inferred that the Bida Basin may have evolved as a result of step-faulting.  A new structural/geological map for the study area has also been evolved. The investigation of the relationship between the overburden coefficient of anisotropy, and groundwater yield, (Y) in the Basement Complex area shows that, on a local scale, the latter generally increases with the former.  Metamorphic rocks are characterised by low values of anisotropy coefficient, while igneous rocks have higher values.|Theses collection.|electrical resistivity/well/borehole data/groundwater development/aquifer units/hydrogeological conditions/ Vertical Electrical Soundings (VES)/edimentary environment/edimentary environment/igneous rocks*||||||Ajayi,Comfort  Folasade|M|Green's function for singular boundary value problems||||||M.Sc.|Y.A.S.

The investigation was carried out to look into the conditions governing the existence and uniqueness of Green's function for nth order BVP, and when established, how to obtain the Green's function and to use it in obtaining the solution of the problems.The fourth order BVP arising from beam deflection theory, which previous workers had considered on a finite interval, is studied in this work on an infinite and semiinfinite interval. The solutions of singular BVP with vanishing coefficient on one of the ends of the interval are also considered.  The existence and uniqueness of solutions for the problems considered are established.It was observed that Green's function can be obtained for differential operators which are self adjoint.  In particular a (2nl)th order linear differential operator cannot be made self adjoint and so Green's function of such equations cannot be obtained.  However, when the equations are self adjoint or can be made self adjoint, complicated BVP can be easily solved with the use of Green's function method by reducing the equation to integral equations. In this respect, certain classes of singular BVP other than those considered here can be easily handled. |Theses collection.|theory of Green's functions/Boundary Value Problems (BVP)/existence and uniqueness/beam deflection theory/finite interval/linear differential operator*||||||Muse, Wasiu Adesola|M|Investigation on the morphology, nature and development of the male accessory reproductive gland of the variegated grasshopper Zonocerus variegatus L.

This work investigated the morphology and development of the male accessory gland of adult male Z. variegatus and the nature of its secretion in the dry-season adult grasshoppers with respect to its protein, amino acid and sugar constituents.  This is with a view to providing information that would further enhance the biological control of the insect.The nymphs of Z. variegatus were collected on the campus of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife and they were maintained on Chromolaena odorate (L.) King and Manihot esculenta in illuminated cages. Newly emerged adult males and females were isolated, maintain on cassava shoots and subsequently used in experiments.  The gross morphology, histology, protein, amino acid and carbohydrate contents of the accessory glands were studied using standard histological and biochemical techniques.The accessory gland consists of eleven pairs of slender tubules of varying lengths, and five gland types are identified.  The gland comprises a basement membrane and an epithelial layer.  As it developed, the cells of the epithelial layer decreased in height and the diameter of its lumen increased simultaneously, suggesting an apocrine mode of secretion.Protein concentration of the glands increased continuously from day 0 to 35 days of development, the increase being highest between day 7 and 14-day-old insects.  Copulation studies suggest that protein materials transferred from the male to the female during mating in replenished after 12 hours.  Electropherograms of the gland extracts of day 0 to 56-day-old adult insects gave a variable number of protein bands.  Protein fraction 8 appeared for the first time in 14-day-old adult insects.  Accessory gland types revealed a mixture of heterogenous proteins having molecular weights ranging from 8,900 to 46,800.A wide range of free amino acids was obtained from the glands at day 0 to 28 days of development with proline, alanine, glycine, glutamic acid and serine occurring in highest concentrations.  The quantities of total free amino acid fluctuated with the development of the accessory gland.  Galactose, glucose, fructose, cellobiose, trehalose and lactose were detected in the gland extract with increase in concentration from day 0 to 42 days of development.  The presence of protein fraction with molecular weight of about 30,000; high concentrations of proline alanine, glycine and glutamic acids, which were earlier implicated in the stimulation of oviposition in some species of insects, and the positive effect of the injection of male accessory gland into the adult female Z. variegatus, all point to the fact that the accessory glands of adult male Zonocerus variegatus contain oviposionstimulating substance.|Theses collection.|Cassava (Manihot esculenta, Cranz)/carbohydrate/Tropical Africa/pest, Zonocerus variegatus (Linnaeus)/morphology and development/Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife /accessory gland/Protein concentration/Copulation studies/-Copulation studies*||||||Oba, Olusanya Akindele|M|The impact of international trade and finance on Nigeria's economic growth 1960-1987.|||||| Ph.D. |A.

The large number of empirical studies on trade and growth over the years failed to resolve the theoretical controversy over the contribution of trade and external finance to economic growth of developing countries.This study has quantitatively assessed the relative impacts of trade and external finance on Nigeria's economic growth.  It shed more light on the validity of various views expressed on the subject.  It has also contributed to a proper appraisal of the various policies employed for managing international trade and finance for the promotion of economic growth in Nigeria.An econometric model comprising four equations, viz: growth equation, capital formation equation, export equation and import of capital goods equation was developed.  The model was applied to the Nigeria situation in the period 1960-1987.  The method of ordinary least squares estimating techniques was used to obtain the results of estimated equations of the model.  The results showed that foreign loans, foreign private investment and export as percentage of GDP have no doubt had important beneficial effects on economic growth in Nigeria.  Foreign loans and foreign private investment were, however, found to be negatively related to domestic capital formation.  Capital goods imported and exports were found to be essential for domestic capital formation in Nigeria.The necessity for Nigeria's involvement in international trade was established by our thesis; relative export prices and percentage change in world income were important in the simulation of the demand for capital goods such as machinery and equipment.The results of the impact multiplier analysis of exogenous variable changes in 1977, 1985 and 1987 revealed that export price incentives and expansions of world economic activity would tend to encourage export earnings in Nigeria.  Furthermore, the results also revealed that foreign loan has negative direct and indirect effects on domestic capital formation, while foreign private investment has positive direct and indirect effects.  This result suggests that different forms of external finance can have varied effects on the productivity of investment in Nigeria.Our thesis is that the achievement of self-sustained economic growth in Nigeria requires the generation of domestic savings through sound economic policies aimed at raising export performance, the cumulative effect of which will be of wider benefits to Nigeria's prosperity and financial stability.|Theses collection.|international trade/finance/Nigeria's economic growth/ empirical studies/external finance/economic growth/developing countries/econometric model/capital goods/Foreign loans /foreign private investment /exogenous variable/financial stability*||||||Ogunrinola, Isaiah Oluranti|M|Employment and earnings in the urban informal sector of Ibadan||||||Ph.D.|A.O.

It also investigated whether or not the sector provides permanent employment for some members of the urban labour force.  The methodology of the study involved the use of questionnaires to elicit desired information from informal sector enterprises as well as formal and informal sector workers in manufacturing and technical services from selected enumeration areas of Ibadan. The analytical techniques relied on the use of employment and earning regression models as well as informal employment probability model.  Also, summary statistics like mean, mode, median, ratios and percentages were used.The estimated employment model shows that the level of capital employed, earnings, amount of education of owner, quality of training of owner and the type of industry where an enterprise operates significantly affect the level of employment.  Such employment is found to be permanent for 86 per cent of informal sector operators, while 94 per cent of the formal sector workers interviewed expressed strong desire of moving to the informal sector whenever they can save up the required starting capital. This fact is also confirmed by the informal employment probability models estimated for the urban labour force of Ibadan.  Thus, the result of our study does not uphold the probabilistic migration hypothesis with respect to the role of informal sector in the urban urban labour market of Ibadan.With respect to earnings, the informal sector workers compare favourably with their formal sector counterparts.  Sixty-one per cent earn more than N200 per month while the mean monthly earnings is N583.  Our earnings distribution model estimated shoes that variables like sector of employment, migration status, education, quality of training, labour market experience and the type of industry in which an enterprise operates significantly affect the distribution of earnings among the urban labour force. In terms of skill development, the apprenticeship system is the most dominant form.  Ninety percent of current entrepreneurs were thus trained, while a total of 2,200 apprentices had been previously trained by these master. At present, the 544 enterprises sampled have a total of 2,119 apprentices that are being trained.  However, in terms of the extent of skill utilisation, it is found that a considerable amount of underemployment ranging from 21 to 36 percent exists in the sector.Apart from its contributions to employment, earnings and skill formation; this study shows that the urban informal sector , rather than disappearing with time, is a major and growing element of development in the urban labour market of Ibadan.  Thus, the government and its agents (e.g. the National Directorate of Employment), skill development, the apprenticeship system and researchers are called upon to focus more attention to the sector to sustain and enhance the sector's contributions to development.|Theses collection.|urban informal sector/Ibadan/income/employment generation/skill formation/urban labour force/technical services/informal employment/skill development/apprenticeship system/National Directorate of Employment*||||||Oluwatimehin, John Medaiyese|M| Sediment dynamics in some streams on quartzites in central South-Western Nigeria.||||||Ph.D.| L.K.

This information is especially vital not only for the geomorphological purposes of estimating the rate of surface lowering but also because the knowledge of the sediment load if rivers is vital for planning the use of such rivers for water supply projects.The objective here is to analyse the spartio-temporal variations in suspend sediment and solute load and yield characteristics of twelve small streams draining quartizites and quart-schist on the pre-Cambrian Basement Complex of Southwestern Nigeria.  These were analysed with respect to their land use and rainfall pattern based on data collected between April 1985 and May 1986.  An analysis of some of the elements of the solute content of stream water was also carried out.For this exercise, data on the drainage basins were obtained through map analysis and from field measurements.  Data on stream discharge values were obtained based on stream flow rating and the use of the small OTT current metre.  Data on suspended sediment and solute 1 ad were obtained from water sample analysis, while data on soil were obtained from the analysis of soil samples in the laboratory.The multivariate interrelationship between the morphometric, land use and rainfall parameters and between these and the sediment yield parameters were determined using correlation and multiple regression.  A classification algorithm was used to show the multivariate relationship between sediment yield and land use and basin physiographic parameters.  The pattern of suspended and solute transport in the streams, especially during storm-period, were examined graphically using hydrographs and hysteresis loops.  Three major groups of sediment response were identified: the single stream rise events in which sediment can either peak before or after discharge or may even correspond with it; the multiple rise events often associated with rainfalls of long duration with sediment peak before or after discharge peak; and the random or mixed response patterns in which sediment concentration respsonse exhibits no clear pattern.  Controlling factors of sediment availability, duration, frequency and intensity of storm event, antecedent precipitation indices, exhaustion and flushing effects.The results show that although the streams which are more or less of the same order and drain areas underlain by similar rock type, and within the same climatic region, exhibited great variations in their flow, sediment load and yield.  Suspended sediment concentration ranged from 6 mg/l and 2480 mg/l during the rainy season.  Specific suspended sediment yield varied between 2.1 tonnes/km-2/yr-1 and 44.4 tonnes/km-2/yr-1 with an average of 13.9 tonnes/km-2/yr-1.  Specific solute yield ranged from 6.0 tonnes/km-2/yr-1 to 42.5 tonnes/km-2/yr-1 with an average of 18.9. tonnes/km-2/yr-1  Solute yields are generally higher in the forested basins while suspended sediment yield is higher in the cultivated basins.  Spatial variations in suspended sediment concentration during the rainy season was related partly to land use variation and partly to routing conditions along the channels.Statistical analysis shows that land use and rainfall factors accounted for over 68% and 82% of the variance of total suspended sediment and solute yields respectively among the basins.  Over 92% of the total sediment yield in all the basins were transported during the rainy season with the maximum daily suspended yield contributing between 2.5 and 23.5 percent of the total suspended load in the basins during the study period.Nitrate, phosphate, potassium and magnesium levels in the stream water are generally low with nitrate, phosphate and potassium levels in the cultivated basins higher than the forested and the fallowed basins.  The standard limits for suspended and dissolved solids in drinking water have not been reached nor the limits for ions and cations exceeded. Agricultural and farming activities within the drainage basins are potential sources of water pollution by sediments, pesticides and fertilizers.Value of sediments data drom the study could be a useful index of catchment dynamics with which to assess the effects of man on the landscape. The action of man in disturbing the equilibrium of geomorphological and hydrological processes, as with agriculture is evidenced by increases in sediment production.|Theses collection.|sediment production /humid tropical environment/geomorphological purposes/water supply projects/Southwestern Nigeria/drainage basins/potassium and magnesium levels*||||||Dzobo, Joselin Mawunyo|F|Preparation and separation of fatty acids from palm oils. ||||||M.Sc.|A.N.

One of such industrial raw materials is fatty acid from vegetable oils. A modified Twitchell process involving hydrolysis was used to prepare fatty acids from palm oil and palm kernel oil.  Solvent crystallization using methanol as solvent was used for separation into olein  and stearin fractions.  The effects of water to oil ratio, temperature,  catalyst level and time on the hydrolysis were evaluated and the kinetics of the hydrolysis studied.  Similarly, the effects of fatty acid mixture to solvent ratio, type of solvent, final temperature of cooling and rate of cooling on the solvent crystallization process were evaluated. The kinetics of the hydrolysis was found to be first order for the first 6 hours.  After this period, the reaction deviates from first order kinetics due to the effects of the reverse reaction.  The first order kinetics confirms that the reaction is homogeneous which occurs by water dissolving in the oil phase.  The rates of reaction constants of 0.32 hr-1 and 0.21 hr-1 were obtained for the hydrolysis of palm and palm kernel oils respectively.  These values are greatly affected by change in temperature.It was found that a double stage hydrolysis at 100oC using 0.5% (w/w) catalyst to oil ratio with 25% (w/w) and 50% (w/w) water to oil ratio for palm oil and palm kernel oil respectively increased the degree of completion from 75  98% for palm oil and 70  87% for palm kernel oil. The total reaction  was found to be 12 hours. Each stage took 6 hours to complete with sweetwater being withdrawn at the end of each stage. In the separation process, it was found that a fatty acid mixture to solvent ratio of 2030% (w/w) gave the best possible  separation.  The two solvents used showed no difference in their effect on separation. An increase in the rate of cooling from 0.7oC/min to 0.9oC/min produced a poorer quality olein fraction.  The final temperature attained during cooling has an effect on the quality of the olein fraction.  Lower temperatures produce low quality olein fractions.|Theses collection.| local sourcing/industrial raw materials/fatty acid/vegetable oils/modified Twitchell process/Solvent crystallization/Lower temperatures*||||||Iwuala, Justin Okechukwu|M|Application of spouted bed systems in gari processing.||||||M.Sc.|O.

The spouted bed technique is a variant of fluidization which permits agitation of solid materials that are too coarse and uniform in size for good fluidization.  Later modifications of the original spouted bed system design, which include the draft tube spouted bed (DTSB) and the sideoutlet spouted bed has extended the application to small particles (dp < 1mm) and thus placed spouted beds in direct   competition  for  applications involving fluidized beds.  The  DTSB has been applied successfully in many areas which include drying of animal blood, combustion, tablet coating, particle granulating and chemical reactor operations.  The present study involved the application of the DTSB system in 'garification' stage of gari processing.  This entailed the design and fabrication of the DTSB system and the use of the fabricated DTSB as a 'garifier'.The design of the experimental DTSB was based on the determined physical particle properties (moisture content, particle size, gelatinization temperature) and predicted spouting properties of product gari and pregarified gari. The DTSB system consisted of a pyrex glass of thickness 0.2 x 102m with a 60o conical base followed by a 5.8 x 102m diameter and 0.76m height cylindrical section with 2 x 102m inlet region and a draft tube insert of 1.5 x 102m internal diameter and 0.24m in length.  The draft tube is supported in the drying chamber by a 3-glass rod tripod of 3cm each. The heating chamber consisted of an air inlet and outlet regions of 2 x 103m internal diameter, followed by a 3.1 x 102m diameter and O.80m long cylindrical section. It was discovered that fermented cassava flour could not be garified without a spouting aid at any moisture content below 60%.  Using already processed gari as the spouting aid, fermented cassava flour was readily garified provided its moisture content was greater than 30%. In effect, the minimum moisture content before gelatinization could occur was higher than that required in existence processing methods which is about 24%. Although fermented cassava was found to gelatinize at about 60oC using an amylogram, no gelatinization was observed in the DTSB until the bed temperature reached 130oC. The DTSB techniques yielded a gari product of very low moisture content when compared with other methods. In addition, the cold water swelling capacity of the gari produced was found to be relatively highe than that produced using conventional methods.|Theses collection.|agricultural grains/fluidization/bed system design/ physical particle properties /moisture content/ particle size/ gelatinization temperature/fermented cassava*||||||Akinwale, Oladotun Coker|M|The effects of high velocity gradients in water coagulation.||||||M.Sc. |Olusola Ogedegbe||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi  Awolowo  University, Civil Engineering       |1991|||OAU|||||xiii, 104p|||||||English ||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.O.

Purchase of aluminium sulphate (alum)  commonly used in the nation's waterworks is gulping colossal amounts of money yearly. Any effort to substantially reduce this therefore becomes meaningful, laudable and one in the right direction.  It is against this background that this study was undertaken to investigate the effects of high velocity gradient, G (intense rapid mixing) in water coagulation,, with and without addition of coagulant.The typical raw water used for the study was obtained by damming a portion of the stream in front of the Civil Engineering Building at Obafemi Awolowo University, IleIfe.  A 32litre sample of the raw water was positioned ready for the run in a tank and using a calibrated highshear stirrer, the water was subjected to selected levels of G200, 500 and 800 per second for 2, 8, 16, 24 and 32 minutes. In cases where coagulant was used to supplement G, it was added immediate the rapid mixing was begun.  The results were analysed using turbidity removal, pH and level of finished water alkalinity as yardsticks.It was found that turbidity removal generally continued to improve with increasing G with or without coagulant, with more substantial improvement obtained when coagulant was applied.  However optimum coagulant dosage was 20 mg/l alum or 30 mg/l ferric chloride for all levels of G applied.Application of velocity gradients without coagulant generally had no significant effect on the pH and level of finished water alkalinity.  On the other hand, depressions in the pH values and levels of finished water alkalinity resulted when G was supplemented with coagulants, with greater depressions given by the ferric chloride than the alum.Conclusively, high velocity gradients with and without addition of chemical coagulants have substantial effects on water coagulation.  On the basis of the three yardsticks of turbidity removal, pH and level of finished water alkalinity, application of G alum gave the best results.|Theses collection.|foreign currencies/high velocity gradient/pH/level of finished water alkalinity/turbidity removal*||||||Asemota, Godwin Norense Osarumwense|M|Development of a generalized algorithm for steady state and contingency load flow investigations||||||M.Sc.|M.

The established methods of Loadflow Computation employing either the Gause-Seidel or newtonRaphson algorithms do not consider contingencies such as sudden loss of generation and transmission line.  Additional algorithms are employed to obtain the system performance under such conditions and a consequent delay in obtaining solution in contingency situations.  An algorithm which combines existing methods such that Load flow computation under normal as well as contingency conditions is developed and employed to simulate a model power system.The generalised algorithm employs the fastdecoupled technique which separates electrical power into its real and reactive parts.  For a typical sevenbusbar network, the power flow equation is linearised around a specified operating point and the algorithm was developed such that load flow solutions are obtained under steady state and contingency situations. Contingency analysis is simulated by the removal of transmission lines, transformers and generators of the seven busbars system, one at a time, to investigate the load flow pattern.  An optimal generation strategy that aims at producing and supplying the most economical power in a system is also investigated.  The simulation is carried out on an IBM PC/AT digital computer running on Fortran.The results from the simulation show rapid convergence for the nonlinear load flow equations, even without acceleration factor.  The total optimal real power generated is 10.78pu at the minimum cost of fuel. The variance of power flow of the lines about their mean position varies between 0.0 and 0.415. The load flow algorithm can easily be extended to cope with larger network. It can be implemented for online estimation of load flow when suitable modifications and possible extensions are made to the algorithm.|Theses collection.|Loadflow information/electrical power system/contingency conditions/Gause-Seidel or newtonRaphson algorithms /fastdecoupled technique/nonlinear load flow equations*||||||Fagbohun, Olumuyiwa Oludare|M|Development of an automatic generation controller for a practical electric power generating system.||||||M.Sc. |O.A.

When any imbalance between the the generation and load demand occurs, the frequency of the system deviates from its nominal value.  This, among other effects, affects the performance of frequency sensitive loads. It is therefore necessary to formulate a generationload demand balance strategy to kee the frequency fluctuations within acceptable limits of the nominal value. In this work, the conventional method of controlling power generation and frequency under chaning power demand by the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) was studied and its deficiencies highlighted.  A microprocessor based automatic generation control safer bias designed and simulated on a digital computer.The control system consists of a supervisory  controller for the control centre and an area controller for each generating station, both linked by a communication network. The supervisory controller compares the power system frequency with a reference frequency of 50Hz. The error is used to compute the required generation change and this change is distributed among generating stations according to predetermined criteria. The required changes are encoded and transmitted to the generating stations.  Each area controller decodes the received signal and effects the required  generation change so that the operating frequency is maintained close to its nominal value.The performance of the designed controllers was simulated on a computer.  To maintain the system frequency within +0.2% of its nominal value, the system controllers were found to respond to a change in generation request in less than thirty seconds compared with about the five minutes it takes to get on generating station to respond using the present method. This result satisfies the design criteria for the maintenance of frequency at nominal value, fast response to demands and improved efficiency and reliability. |Theses collection.|electric power/generationload demand balance/nominal value/frequency sensitive loads/frequency fluctuations /National Electric Power Authority (NEPA)/microprocessor /automatic generation control safer bias/communication network/generating stations*||||||Oyebisi, Timothy Oyedepo|M|Development of a telemetry system for the measurement of groundfoot forces in human gaits||||||Ph.D.|L.A.

This allows for identification of the degree of the abnormalities in pathological gaits thereby, providing diagnosis and hence the required treatment to prescribe.This thesis discusses the development of a telemetry system for the measurement of groundfoot forces in human gaits.  The system consists of both a mobile subassembly and a stationary subassembly. The mobile subassembly consists of an instrumented shoe unit, transmitting-end signal processing module and an FM transmitter.  The mobile subassembly which is battery powered and compactly packed is to be carried by a subject whose groundfoot forces are being measured.  The stationary subassembly which is at the operator base is made up of an FM receiver, receivingend signal processing module, an analogue processing module and an interface module made up of RS232C serial interface and GPIB IEEE 488 parallel interface units.  The outputs of the interface module are fed into the inputs of an HP85 minicomputer for data acquisition and analysis.  The outputs of the analogue processing module are fed into the inputs of a chart recorder to obtain optional and alternative analogue display of the groundfoot force data.The passive components used to build the system have tolerances in the range 0.1% to 1% and temperature coefficient of between 50ppm/oC and 75ppm/oC.  These together with the use of high performance active devices make the system to have a maximum measurable groundfoot force of 100kgf with +1% (or -1%) error.  The system has a range of 100 metres while the bandwidth of each force channel extends beyond 30Hz.  The gait waveform obtained for normal subject is a true representation of the well known pattern of groundfoot forces.  From the shapes of these waveforms, the degree of abnormalities in certain pathological gaits are identified and quantified.  This indicates that the systems can be effectively used as a clinical tool and as a research equipment in the studies of human gaits.|Theses collection.|rehabilitative procedures/functional normalities/pathologic gait/ambulation/telemetry system/mobile subassembly/stationary subassembly/tolerances /parallel interface units*||||||Bamigbade, Ajibade Kolawole|M|Evaluation of some nonwheat flours for water manufacture||||||M.Sc. |I.A.

In this study, the manufacture of wafers from nonwheat flours is investigated.  Wafer samples produced from cocoyam flour and starch, green banana and breadfruit flours were evaluated for some quality attributes, acceptability and storage stability.Flour and starch were prepared from cocoyam tubers, green banana and mature unripe breadfruit. Experiments were carried out to determine for flour and starch yield, proximate composition, Brabender amylograph pasting characteristics, laboratory and pilot optimum water absorption and batter consistency. Wafers manufactured from flour and starch samples were evaluated for proximate composition, weight, thickness, bulk density, flour acidity, moisture uptake, colour and sensory attributes. Flour and starch yield for cocoyam was 73.06 and 48.84% respectively.  The nonwheat flours had low protein contents which ranged between 1.70 and 7.89%, while corresponding value for wheat flour was 8.9%.  The range obtained for fat and ash contents were 0.08  2.20% and 0.29  4.05% respectively.  All the nonwheat flour samples were found to absorb more water than the wheat flour.  Amylograph pasting viscosity data showed breadfruit flour to be most stable while banana flour was the least stable.Data obtained for wafer quality weight (0.14-0.22 g/cm2), thickness (1.37-2.14 mm) and bulk density (0.08-0.13 g/cm3).  Storage stability test showed banana wafer to be comparable with that of wheat wafer while cocoyam flour wafer was the least stable.  Breadfruit wafer picked up highest amount of moisture at 32.3% relative humidity while wheat wafer absorbed the least amount of moisture.  The non-wheat wafers were found to be acceptable by more than 80% of panelists, however there was no significant difference in the overall acceptability of the sample.|Theses collection.|Wafer/nonwheat flours/storage stability/batter consistency/ proximate composition/weight, thickness/bulk density/flour acidity/moisture uptake/colour and sensory attributes*||||||Unokiwedi, Chukwuemeka Charles|M|Nutritional evaluation of warankasi prepared from cow milk partially substituted with melon milk.||||||M.Sc.|J.B.

Consequently, a great deal of attention has been focussed on finding alternative protein sources to either supplement or replace the animal protein sources which are scarce and expensive.  Plant protein sources have been found attractive both on cost and availability.  Warankasi, a soft unripened cheese, was produced from whole milk partially substituted with melon protein.Experiments were conducted to investigate the level of substitution of melon seed milk into whole milk in the production of warankasi.  Fresh cow milk was obtained from Cogi near Ede while melon milk was produced in the laboratory from melon seeds obtained from Sabo market, IleIfe.  The substitution was carried out at the ratio of 3:1 (i.e. 25% melon milk to 75% whole milk).  Cheese was produced by the application of Sodom apple (Calotropis procera) juice extract where the active enzyme has been identified as "calotropain".  The cheese thus produced was named "waragusi".  It was later fed to experimental animals for a period of 28 days.The results showed that the composition of waragusi (dry weight basis) was 41.68% protein, 48.83% fat, 6.28% ash and 3.12% carbohydrate.  The yield with respect to melon milk, waragusi and warankasi were 74.34%, 22.16% and 24.90%) respectively.  This waragusi compared favourably well with whole warankasi in terms of organoleptic properties such as Aroma, Texture, Colour and Flavour. The bioassay procedure also showed that the composite cheese enabled experimental animals to grow such that the parameters; Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) and Net Protein Ratio (NPR) showed no significant differences (P> 0.05) with those obtained for whole cheese (warankasi). Values of (PER), 1.94 + 0.23 and 2.43 0.39; and (NFR) 2.37 0.24 and 2.92 0.39 were recorded for waragusi and warankasi respectively. It was thus concluded that melon milk and other suitable vegetable milk offer potential sources as regards substitution in the production of cheese.  The advantages of these substitutions in the total eradication of Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) and general malnutrition was greatly highlighted.|Theses collection.|Protein shortage/developing countries/animal protein sources/Plant protein sources/Warankasi/organoleptic properties/Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER)/Net Protein Ratio (NPR)/ bioassay procedure*||||||Adetunji, Adelana Rasak|M|Use of cyanide solution from cassava for the extraction of gold||||||M.Sc.|G.O.

The principal reagents for amalgamation and cyanidation methods are mercury and sodium cyanide (NaCN) respectively. Neither of these reagents is manufactured locally.  Cassava has been found to contain cyanogenic glucoside from which hydrocyanic acid is liberated.  This work is therefore intended to investigate the suitability of cyanide solutions extracted from cassava for the extraction of gold.  It is also intended to compare the gold yields from a given deposit by employing the methods of amalgamation and cyanidation and deduce therefrom the better method of extraction of gold from the deposit.The Modified Lambert method was employed in extracting cyanide from cassava and analysed for concentration. Various cyanide concentrations were prepared from both the solution obtained from cassava and standard NaCN.  The gold ore employed had earlier been preconcentrated from the source.  Part of the ore was retained as received while the rest was ground to 230 mesh to facilitate cyanidation process. The standard method of cyanidation was used at laboratory level in treating known quantities of ore with the various solutions.  Also known quantities of ore were treated with mercury for amalgamation.  It was found that the yields from cyanide solutions from cassava were relatively lower than the yields from equivalent concentrations of standard NaCN.  However, for cyanide solutions from both sources, the yields increased with concentrations.  The efficiency of cyanide solutions from cassava compared with the standard grade sodium cyanide (NaCN) in terms of gold yield for equivalent concentrations was found to range from about 60% to 78%.  Also the yields from the amalgamation process were lower than the yields from both sources of cyanide especially at relatively high cyanide concentrations.|Theses collection.|extraction of gold/amalgamation and cyanidation methods/cyanide/cassava /cyanidation process/ cyanide concentrations*||||||Adetunji, Rasaq Olayide|M| Evaluation of influence of process variables on the corrosion performance of hotdipped galvanized steels.||||||M.Sc.|J.A.

This environment is highly corrosive because of its salinity with high percentage of sodium chloride. The influence of galvanizing temperature, immersion duration,, withdrawal speed, aluminium and antimony addition to the zinc bath on the corrosion performance of hot-dip galvanized steel sheets in 5% sodium chloride environment were investigated and evaluated.  This work is expected to establish the optimum process variables and thickness of the coating evolved, which are vital to the improvement of the corrosion resistance of galvanized sheets, particularly in marine environment.The investigations involved hotdipping of three gauges of clean steel sheets in "pure" molten zinc at 430oC, 450oC, 470oC and 490oC for 30 seconds, 60 seconds, 90 seconds and 120 seconds and withdrawing them at speeds of 3m/min, 4m/min, 5m/min and 6m/min.  Small amounts of aluminium, antimony and combinations of the two elements in proportions of 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.15%, and 0.2% of each element were added to the zinc bath in form of aluminiumzinc alloy and antimonyload alloy.  The galvanized sheets were tested for corrosion performance according to ASTM standard B 117 (1964).  Weight losses of the tested specimen were determined.It was found that, the corrosion resistance of the coatings increased with increase in galvanizing temperature from 430oC to 450oC, but decreased thereafter. It also increased with increase in immersion time from 30 seconds to 60 seconds and decreased thereafter.  The corrosion resistance of the coatings increased with increase in withdrawal speeds having maxima at 4m/min and 5m/min for gauge 22 and 28 sheets respectively.  However, for gauge 18 sheets it decreased with increasing withdrawal speed.  The optimum process variables were determined to be 450oC as galvanizing temperature, 60 seconds as immersion time, 3m/min, 4m/min and 5m/min as withdrawal speeds for gauges 18, 22 and 28 sheets, respectively.  The coating thicknesses obtained from these optimum variables were 85 um, 90 um and 101 um for gauges 28, 22 and 18 sheets, respectively.  Antimony was the most effective in increasing corrosion resistance, followed by aluminium plus antimony and lastly, aluminium.  The optimum concentrations of the elements were found to be 0.05% for aluminium, 0.15% for antimony and the combination of the two for aluminum plus antimony addition.|Theses collection.|Hotdipped galvanized steels/ reinforcing steel/marine environment/salinity/galvanizing temperature/immersion duration/withdrawal speed/corrosion resistance*||||||Akinbile, Olufemi Adeniyi|M|The role of politics in the development of secondary schools in Ogun State, 1976 - 1986||||||M.A. History of Education|S.S.

Data were collected from Primary sources, such as documents and interviews, and were supplemented with data from secondary sources like books, journals and newspapers. Data from these sources were collated, analysed and discussed to determine the role of politics in the development of secondary schools in Ogun State during the period. Simple statistics such as percentages were used for the analysis.It was found that politics affected the development of secondary schools in Ogun State between 1976 and 1986. The scope and provision of secondary education increased substantially between 1976 and 1979. During this period, when the Federal government launched the Universal Free Primary Education Scheme throughout the country, Ogun State which hitherto, enjoyed free primary education under the Action Group government of Chief Obafemi Awolowo, continued to enjoy it under the military government. In order to make provision for the increased number of pupils who would leave primary schools for secondary schools and to sustain the support of the citizens of the state, the state military administration built more  secondary schools between 1976 and 1979.  In fact, thirtytwo new secondary schools were established in the state during this period. From 1979 to 1983a partisan polity was a major influence in the development of secondary schools in the state The ruling political party in the state, the Unity Party of Nigeria, had as one of its party programmes, Free Education at all levels, It was this policy that three d the provision of secondary education in the state during the period. Consequently, many secondary schools were established. Throughout the state and students  increased more ten ever before. The number of secondary schools rose from one hundred, at the beginning of 1979, to three hundred and thirty-five, by 1983. In addition, the awareness of the people of the state on education increased during this period; and  the need to encourage more pupils to attend secondary schools forced the state government to provide more opportunities for primary wheels leavers to benefit from secondary education. When a military government assumed office in the state in 1983, it  re-examined the provision of secondary education. Thus, between 1983 and 1986, secondary education in the state witnessed a lot of fundamental changes. The military government, having found that the standard of secondary education was falling due to the politicization of education by the past civilian regime, introduced some corrective measures. These measures led to a drastic fall in the number of secondary schools in the state. Student enrolment also decreased; since secondary education was no longer free. It became clear that the politicization of education did not help the development of education in the state; rather it lowered the standard and quality of education. Perhaps that was why the military government took steps to remedy the situation.|Theses Collection|Politics/secondary education/Universal Free Primary Education Scheme/Action Group government/Chief Obafemi Awolowo/military government*||||||Akinremi, Francis Akinsode|M|Organisation and administration of sporting activity programmes in tertiary institutions in Kwara and Osun State||||||M.A. Physical Education|S.A.

Specifically, the administrative patterns of sports were determined in terms of their effectiveness, development of sports facilities, equipment and personnel as well as achievement in sports competitions.Subjects for the study consisted of 180 athletes selected using the random sampling technique. Twenty-four Sports Organizers/Coaches were also selected from six tertiary institutions in Kwara and Osun States. Data were collected with two structured questionnaires; the Athletes Sports Questionnaire  (ASQ) and Sports Personnel  Questionnair (SPQ) which were served on the subjects. Scheduled personal interviews were conducted the respondents. Data collected were analysed descriptively using percentages.The results of the analysis revealed that facilities and equipment in the institutions were inadequate in number and were not properly maintained..

The study also critically the political and economic influence of the Afro-Asian bloc within the International system, from the 1960s upward, due basically to their preponderance in size within the United Nations General Assembly.The method adopted in the study is descriptive and analytical in nature. Data were sourced secondarily mainly, through the use of published works on the central themes of the subject  matter under review. However informal interviews were conducted on Afro-Asian relations with a critically synthesized comparative analysis of the various data collected.Our findings reveal that, politically, the Afro-Asian bloc performed creditably well within the international arena unlike in the economic realm. Due to their common colonial experience, they were able to stand firmly successfully and with one voice at the U.N. General Assembly to fight against colonialism` apartheid and racism among other issues.Economically, even though the bloc performed creditably to some extent, yet all their efforts in making sure that the World became a better place to live in, where the principles of justice and equity would be the order of the day through the quest for New International Economic order (N.I.E.O,) became unrealisable,  due mainly to the recalcitrant posture of developed Countries unwilling to shift grounds, or even when such grounds were shifted, they were mainly made non-operational. As a result of the foregoing, the study posits that only formidable south-south co-operation could make negotiations the North fruitful, and that the Afro-Asian bloc, if revamped, would certainly go a long way in ameliorating the new perils being witnessed by members in the New World order.|Theses Collection|Afro-Asian bloc/Conference of April 1955, in Indonesia/international system/United Nations General Assembly/colonial experience/apartheid/racism/principles of justice and equity/New International Economic order (N.I.E.O)*||||||Akinlade, Oladipo Rasak|M|An assessment of muscovy duck ( Cairina moschata) production||||||M.Sc.

The first was a survey of 72 duck producers, 12 respondents each in 6 local government areas of Lagos State. The questionnaire sought base-line information pertaining to: flock characteristics, management practices, and production constraints. Administered questionnaires were subjected to non-parametric, descriptive and inferential statistics as appropriate.Only the extensive management system was used by all the respondents. The mean flock size was 6.8 with a drake: duck ratio of 1:2. Water and supplementary feeds (mainly 'eri' and maize grains) were provided daily for ducks. Majority (63.9%) of raisers had experienced disease outbreak in their flocks, and virtually all (95.8%) respondents were interested in receiving veterinary services for their flocks. Disease and mortality were the major production constraints mentioned. The improved productivity of Muscovy ducks will require interventions to prevent and control disease.The second study was a hatchability trial. A total of 69 Muscovy duck eggs were collected from 8 villages in Lagos, Osun and Kwara States. The eggs from Kwara State had significantly (P<0.05) lower mean weights (59.0+2.9g) than those from Lagos (66.95.8) and Osun (61.5+5.4) States. Only eggs from Lagos and Osun States hatched, and their mean duckling hatch weights did not differ significantly (P>0.05) and had a pooled mean value of 39.1 grams. The low hatchability (16%) is attributed to problems with sources of eggs, and conditions of transportation and incubation of the eggs. The third study was a 10-week On-farm feed supplement trial. Three Muscovy duck raisers flocks within the Obafemi Awolowo University staff quarters were each assigned different daily feed supplements as treatments (Ti, T1 20g of unconventional feed, T2 and T3 were raiser determined amounts of commercial feed and maize grains respectively. Though significant differences (P<0.05) in mean daily feed intake were noted - T1 71.622.1, T2 13.80.9, and T3 17.46.6, all treatments resulted in live body weight gains. Treatments significantly (P<0.05) affected body weights of mature ducks: Ti, 1855.8+106.9; T2, 1652.5+61.3; T3, 1276.0+122.2 and drakes: T1, 3695.0+192.7; T2, 2640.0+60.8; T3, 2387.8147.8) and weight gains of grower drakes: T1,15.214.1; T2, 6.2+4.5; T3,-5.0+22.9. This study has shown that Muscovy ducks were kept by the extensive management system in small flock sizes in Lagos State. Also, hatchability of artificially incubated duck eggs was lower than expected, while the unconventional feed supported lower growth rate than conventional feeds.|Theses Collection|Muscovy Ducks/production constraints/mean flock size/veterinary services/disease/mortality/daily feed intake/conventional feeds  *||||||Adeyemi, Toyin Faramade|M|Biodegradation of Oso condensate by Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas fluorescens||||||M.Sc.

For effectiveness, adequate media containing mineral salts, vitamins and appropriate nitrogen sources must be formulated.Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas fluorescens were used in the study of biodegradation of Oso condensate, a light crude oil produced by Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited in Akwa-Ibom State, Nigeria. The ability to degrade and utilize Oso condensate was established on the basis of the growth of these organisms on the condensate as the sole carbon and energy source.Chromatographic analysis was done to show degradation and utilization of the substrate. Turbidimetry and nephelometry were used as measurement parameters of growth at room temperature, and showed exponential growth of the organisms on the oil. Batch operations at 600r.p.m impeller speed, pH of 6.4 and air rate of 3vvm gave typical growth characteristics namely; multiplication rate 'r', doubling time 'g', number of generations 'n', and specific growth rate  for P. fluorescens at 30C  2C as 0.029 hr-', 34.84hr, 1, 0.02hr-' respectively while for P. putida at marked variations in room temperature were for 28C  2C, 0.055hr', 18.35hrs, 2, 0.038hr' and for 30C  2C 0.051hr', 19.61hr, 2.45, 0.035hr' respectively.A comparison of the chromatograph peaks before and after growth showed the preferential utilization of the lower molecular weight fractions of the oil compared to the higher molecular weight fractions by both organisms.

Merrill) seedlings grown in pots filled with top soil autoclaved at 120C for 15 minutes were subjected to weed competition and light stress to study the effects of the stresses on the growth and yield of this important grain legume.Weed competition stress was achieved by growing soybean with spurge weed (Euphorbia heterophylla Linn.) . Light stress on the other hand, was imposed by planting soybean under the shade provided by crepes myrtle (Largerstroemia indica Linn.) tree. There was another treatment which was a combination of the two stresses. 100 ml of water was supplied to each pot daily. This was supplemented with 200m1 of Long Ashton nutrient solution which was supplied twice weekly.During the crop's critical period, weed stress reduced dry matter production by 20%, light stress by 81% while a combination of the two stresses reduced it by 83%. At the end of the experiment, weed stress had increased dry matter by 3.5%, light stress still reduced it by 72 % while a combination of the stresses reduced it by 82%.Generally, plants in direct sunlight did better in terms of root length, leaf area and dry matter, and these increased at successive harvest intervals. Dry matter production was significantly different between light levels (P < 0.01) and the effect of light was dependent on time P < 0.001. Dry matter yield was not significantly different at culture levels (P < 0.05).The calculated growth analysis in terms of leaf area index (LAI), leaf area ratio (LAR), leaf weight ratio (LWR), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area duration (LAD), relative growth rate (RGR), unit leaf rate (ULR) and the measured biochemical compositions namely chlorophyll, ash, moisture, crude fibre, fat, and nitrogen-free extract did not show a regular pattern at successive harvests.The results of relative yield (RY) showed that the crop became more competitive than the weed after its (crop) critical period in sunlight while the weed was generally more competitive under shade. Relative yield of the mixture was greater than 1.0, indicating that the yield of the mixedculture was greater than the mean of the two monocultures.In the reproductive phase, early anthesis was observed in all the stressed plants. Reproductive phase was shortened in the shade irrespective of culture but this was prolonged under weed competition stress in direct sunlight.At the density studied, competition from the weed prolonged the reproductive phases of the crop in both light regimes. Seed yield in mixedculture in full sunlight was significantly different from that of the other three treatments (P < 0.05).Thus, a higher economic return would be obtained when soybean is grown in mixture with C-4 plants. A cheap and natural means of controlling E. heterophylla and related weeds in soybean fields will include employing farming systems that will reduce irradiance and at the same time expose the crop to sunlight.|Theses Collection|Soybean/grain legume/weed competition stress/growth analysis/biochemical compositions/chlorophyll/ash/moisture/mixedculture/monocultures/E. heterophylla/ irradiance/photosynthesis  *||||||Ahura, Anna Nguamo|F|The effectiveness of staff discipline in higher educational institutions in Benue State of Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The Selected institutions were: College of Education, Katsina-Ala and Akperan Orshi College of Agriculture, Yandev. The study covered the years between 1989 and 1994.The methodology employed was theoretical, descriptive and statistical. Primary data were collected through questionnaire and interview methods. Secondary data were collected from the central Administration Offices in each of the institutions. Other relevant information were obtained from files, gazettes, addresses and speeches of the Rector/Provost, Newspapers, unpublished works on the two institutions and other relevant publications.The study established that there exists a relationship between discipline and environmental factors. These include the impact of culture, staff perception of fair discipline, and the role of the state in the management of the institutions. Although both institutions had rules and regulations, and procedures guiding disciplinary action variations were however observed regarding compliance with rules and regulations in the two institutions. Staffs of the College of Agriculture, Yandev were found to be more disciplined than the staff of the College of Education, Katsina-Ala.On the basis of the findings, the study made some policy recommendations which could assist in improving the effectiveness of staff discipline in higher educational Institutions of learning in Benue State. It was recommended that all heads of Departments should have interviews with their subordinates, during which their performance on the job in the previous years is reviewed and they are advised and instructed as to how to improve on their performance. A further recommendation was that Departments in the higher institutions of Learning need to give conscious attention to training and retraining of staff, to eliminate discriminatory practices against women and other cultural norms and values which conflict with organisational rules and regulations.On a final note, it was recommended that management should assess superiors on the basis of the performance of their subordinates. In addition, at the end of every five years, there should be a review of staff conditions of service and out-dated rules be removed or reviewed.|Theses Collection|Higher educational institutions/staff discipline/Rector/Provost/training/retraining of staff/cultural norms*||||||Ajayi, Titus|M|Locational factors supporting viable modern small-scale manufacturing industries in Ondo State, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

From these towns, a total of 160 small-scale industrial establishments which covered seven types of industrial activities namely: bakery, wielding, cloth weaving, furniture making, block making, sawmilling and iceblock making were surveyed. The methods of analysis employed were frequency analysis, percentile tabulation, content analysis, Likert-type scale and Stepwise multiple regression analysis.Small-scale industrial establishments in the study area conformed with the conceptual postulations that they produce mainly for the local market; are owned mostly by sole-proprietors and their main sources of capital is the personal savings of the operators. The three factors that had good response counts were nearness to market, availability of cheap land and -nearness to raw materials.Eight locational factors represented the independent variables in the stepwise regression model, while the dependent variable is the types of industrial activities. The independent variable in the regression equation provided an explanation for 29.6% of the variation in the dependent variable. Nearness to raw materials explained 11.7% of the variation; Availability of capital contributed 8%, nearness to labour 6.6% and nearness to market 3.3% respectively. The Likert-type scale shows that .3 factors, namely market, land and raw materials are the top-ranking locational factors and as such favourable for the successful location of small-scale manufacturing industries in the study area.In all, the findings imply that the locational factors that accounted for the success and viability of small-scale industrial establishments in the study area are spatio-economic factors, with the non-economic factors playing a supportive role.|Theses Collection|Manufacturing industries/small-scale enterprises/locational factors/sawmilling/local market/sole-proprietors/sources of capital/personal savings/nearness to market/availability of labour/Likert-type scale *||||||Akanle, Titilayo Olajumoke|F|Foraminiferal biostratigraphy and paleoecological deductions of Abiteye-3 and Makaraba-31 wells, Niger Delta||||||M.Sc.

The relationship between Nigeria and Cameroun is no exception. It is against this backdrop that this study examines the changing character of the relationship between the two countries particularly in the period between 1981 and 1994.Although Nigeria and Cameroun share political, economic and cultural, affinities, these have not helped much in preventing mutual suspicion and misunderstanding between the two countries. Perhaps, the fluctuations in their relations are largely reflective of features like the colonially inspired fragmentation of ethnic groups across borders, unstable boundary demarcations and competitive economic and political institutions inherited at independence.Within this context of fluctuating relations, the study analyses the background conditions that shape and determine relations between Nigeria and Cameroun with the specific objective of exploring the factors and forces that ushered in the era of conflict between the two countries in the period under study. We also sought to identify and analyse the areas of cooperation between the two states.In the course of the study, data were obtained from two main sources: Primary and Secondary. The primary source includes pronouncements by top government officials as available in gazettes, government releases, publications and news papers. These were complemented by secondary sources of information from relevant literature such as books, journals, magazines, seminar papers and other academic publications.Given the geographical proximity as well as-the historical and political links between the two countries, the study observed that any approach to the border crisis that aims at a technical demarcation of the boundaries as the basis for the solution of the recurrent border conflict is doomed to fail. In the light of this observation. the study proposed the institution of a `collaborative regime' for the administration of the disputed trans-border areas. This would involve joint management of security, joint exploitation of fishery and minerals resources in their common territorial waters and joint industrial enterprises which would be in the direct interest of the peoples residing in the contested areas. This collaborative regime will hopefully stem the recurrent outbreak of armed conflict and diplomatic tiff between the two countries.|Theses Collection|International system/conflict/co-operation/politics/independence/culture/armed conflict and diplomatic tiff/Nigeria and Cameroun*||||||Adisa, Banji Olalere|M|The impact of farmers' co-operative societies on adoption of improved farm practices in Osun State of Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

Five Local Government Areas (LGAs) were purposefully selected from the twenty-three Local  of involvement in arable crop production. Ten villages were randomly selected (two from each Local Government Area) from each of the five selected LGA. However, between five and twenty respondents (Cooperators and Non-Cooperators) were randomly selected on the basis of the strength of the Cooperative Societies and the population of the Non-Cooperators in each of the selected villages. Therefore, three hundred respondents (150 Cooperators and 150 Non-Cooperators) participated in the study.Structured interview schedule was developed and used for data collection. The statistical tools used in data analysis were frequency counts, mean, percentages, ranking, Chi-square, Correlation and Contingency Coefficient.The findings revealed that the Cooperators adopted more improved practices (land preparation, fertilizer application, Maize varieties, improved varieties of cassava, herbicides, spacing and seed dressing) than the Non-Cooperators. It was also revealed that the farmers joined the Cooperatives for various reasons. These reasons include: access to credit facilities; the desire to help others; the desire to improve their standard of living; moderate interest  rate; leadership training opportunities; adult education facilities; improved income; opportunity to share other farmers' experiences; contact with Extension Agents; and  opportunity to participate in community development activities.Problems associated with the Farmers' Cooperatives in the study area were managerial, structural, financial, logistics and unstable governmental policies. Significant associations were found between household size; membership membership of social organizations; farm size, cosmopoliteness, and the level of cooperation.Positive and significant relationships were found between farm size information sources, level of standard of living, level of formal education, credit sources and adoption of improved farm practices.|Theses Collection|Co-operative societies/farmers'union/Extension Agents/improved practices/farm size information/formal education/standard of living/credit facilities *||||||Adeogun, Oludare Akanni|M|The impact of land tenure systems on land use intensity in Egbado North and South local Government Areas of Ogun State||||||M.Sc.

The major objective of the study was to identify those factors inherent in the customary land tenure systems that are likely to affect land use intensification within the areas of study.Primary data were collected through an intensive farm level survey during the 1993/94 farming year from one hundred and eighty (ISO) farmers in the two Local Government Areas. The major technique of data collection was the use of structured questionnaire and on-the-spot observation. Data analyses were carried out using ordinary least-square stepwise regression, descriptive analysis and inter-correlation techniques.The findings indicated that each farm household cultivates an average of 10.3 hectares. The most important method of acquiring interest in farmlands is through partrilineal inheritance systems. The promulgation of the Land Use Act has not affected agricultural production and productivity at the local or farm level where it was  presumably meant to have its major impact. Some factors found to exert significant influences on land use intensity include land hunger as measured by competitors to specific farmland, and farmers perception of soil fertility. Moreso, the owner operators were not found  better than the tenant farmers in the use of farmlands.It was concluded that no single indicator can effectively represent land use intensification in all places, at all times and in all situations. The implications of the findings are that there is need for a review of the present Land Use Act to reorganise individual fragmented holdings through land consolidation. Measures to offset yield decline under intensified agriculture would be more effective and supported by farmers if planners acknowledge that the determinant of land use intensity is multivarious.|Theses Collection|Land tenure systems/land use intensity/farm level survey/partrilineal inheritance systems/Land Use Act/soil fertility/agriculture/Nigeria*||||||Adepoju, Haolat Folake|F|Strike as an instrument of collective bargaining in the Oyo State civil service. 1978-1993||||||M.Sc.

It was also found out that it is only the presence of a strike that can force most public sector employers to negotiate and that is why strike activity tends to increase by the day.In conclusion,the study made some policy recommendations which could improve industrial relations practices generally and collective bargaining in particular. It was recommended that both management and labour-should develop positive attitudes and orientation towards collective bargainingas an institution thereby reducing incidence of strikes. Another recommendation was that government should stop its undue interference in the affairs of trade unions.

There is the perceived need for the bureaucracy or thecivil service to be responsive to societal needs. To this extent constant efforts are made at improving its performance so as to meet the demands; of the political system andthesociety.One of such efforts at improving the performance of the civil service was through the 1088 Civil Service Reforms enunciated by the Babangida led military regime. The reforms were the most important for their wider implications as it was extended to the state and local government levels. The reforms also altered the basic features of the Nigerian Civil Service which had been in place since the British Colonial Administration which established the Civil Service.Three research methods were adopted in carrying out the study. They are the library and documentary research, unstructured interviews and discussions with Civil Servants and finally, a questionnaire survey was distributed to sample opinions of Federal Civil Servants and non civil servants (the professional) in relation to the civil service reforms put in place. A total of 400 questionnaires were distributed while 258 or 64.5% were retrieved.The study found out that the perfection of hierarchy in the Nigerian Civil Service is not synonymous efficiency. Also, we found out that the concentration of awesome powers of financial management and disciplinary powers in the Minister/Commissioner may hinder public accountability. Furthermore, it was discovered that making the Ministers at the federal level and the commissioners at the state level the accounting officer in the Ministries has further reduced public accountability in the Civil Services in Nigeria.In addition, the professionalisation of the civil service personnel and structure has not enhanced efficiency and effectiveness in the civil services. This is due to the fact that civil servants are required to serve their career in one department or unit in the ministry without allowance for moving around to gather experience.Finally, since continued emphasis on correcting structural deformities of the bureaucracies as well as on administrative reforms and personnel turnover would do no more than scratch the surface of the problem, this study submits that a system transformation and the creation of a peoples's bureaucratic militia are the very first steps towards  making the Nigerian civil bureaucracy an effective agent of socio-economic development. |Theses Collection|Bureaucracy/Civil Service Reforms/military regime/British Colonial Administration/public accountability/Nigerian civil bureaucracy/Babangida led military regime  *||||||Adetoye, Peter Abiodun|M|Nigeria - Liberia relations under Samuel Doe.||||||M.Sc.

How the Doe coup of 1980 in Liberia marked a turning point in the Nigeria-Liberia relations was explored. The ill-will that prevailed between Nigeria and  Liberia before the reign of General Babangida in Nigeria and the subsequent understanding between the two countries were evaluated. The study also examined Nigeria's ECOMOG initiative in Liberia as one of the Nigeria's major policy thrusts in Liberia.The method adopted in the study included the descriptive and analytical approaches. Data were sourced primarily by conducting informal interviews and from published works on Nigeria-Liberia relations. A comparative analysis of the data collected was done. Our findings revealed that under military regime, foreign policy decision-making processes tended to be personalized by the military leaders. This led to the marginalization of public opinion and specialized institutions responsible for foreign policy issues. The study established that Nigeria-Liberia relations under Samuel Doe and Ibrahim Babangida transformed from chronic suspicion and hostility that existed between the two countries to that of under-standing and co-operation. It was discovered that under Samuel Doe, Nigeria-Liberia relations was deeply rooted in Supranational interactions and not in mutually benefitting diplomatic or economic agreements.  With the huge amount of human and material resources Nigeria has committed to Liberia, especially at the peak of its civil war, it was the contention of the study that Nigeria should formulate an enduring policy that would further enhance its good relations with Liberia in future.|Theses Collection|International relations/Nigeria's ECOMOG/Nigeria and Liberia/Sergeant Doe/1980 coup in Liberia/foreign policy/General Babangida in Nigeria/military regime/civil war*||||||Adewambe, Folasele Moses|M|Foraminiferal biostratigraphy and paleoecology of strata penetrated by North Apoi - 4 and North Apoi -6 wells in Niger Delta||||||M.Sc.

It. is intended to determine the sequence and age of strata penetrated and attempts a biostratigraphic zonation and correlation of the strata penetrated by the two wells.A total 20 ditch-cutting samples from the two wells were analysed and then processed for foraminifera, using conventional micropaleontological techniques. A total of 76 species, 40 genera and 22 families of both planktonic and benthonic foraminifera were recovered. Of these, 15 species were plankton the restbenthonics.Biostratigraphic zonations carried out were based on the stratigraphic distribution of the foraminifera. Planktonic zones were established (Formal and Informal) for each of the well s. However, the distribution of the benthonics lowed the establishment of three informal zones in each of the two The age of strata penetrated by the two wells was determined usingessentially the time-stratigraphic marker species Globorotalia margaritae which is common to both wells thus indicating a Late Miocene to Early Pliocene age for the strata penetrated b-y the two wells.Generally, there is paucity of foraminiferal species especially the planktonics. However, the planktonic zones established include:	Globorotalia	margoritae zoneandGlobigerinoides obliquuus zone in both wells. For the benthonics, three informal zones nave been established namely: Amphistegina gibbosa/ Amphistegina lessonii zone;   lesson ii zone; Cyclammina cancellata zone; A barren interzone and Alveolophragmium crassum/Bulimina striata zone for North Apoi-4 well.For North Apoi-6 well, three informal zones were also erected namely: Amphistegina gibbosa/Florilus atlanticus zoneRectoglandulina torrida zone and Gyroidina soldanii zone.Palooecological deductions were based on the abundance of highly restricted environment-indicating henthonic foraminifera.Afloat-shore, inner neritic and outer neritic to b-ithyal biefacies have- been recognize-d or the environments of deposition.

The work identified and analysed the present and future implications of the new relations for both countries and the International System, and highlighted the prospects, merits and Limitations of closer ties between Nigeria and Israel. It also identified the problems which both countries would likely encounter in the course of the new relations and suggested possible solutions to such perceived problems.For methodology, both primary and secondary sources materials were relied upon. Official data such as official gazettes, governmental speeches and reports, economic statistical data, U.N.O and O.A.U. resolutions and reports, were aggregated and matched with findings that were unearthed through extensive interviews with scholars, diplomats, civil servants and interest groups. These, together with published books, journals, doctoral dissertations, newspaper and magazine reports were used to execute the research. The findings revealed that contrary to general expectations, the newly established relations have not yielded much economic or diplomatic break-throughs for either country neither has it solved Nigeria's need for industrialization through scientific/technological assistance from Israel or its United States ally. Aside minor gains through tourism, cultural exchanges, trade, educational and technical assistance, as well as diplomatic co-operations, the foundation of a strong and virile future relation is just being laid. However, the realization of such foundation work could be marred by political instability (mainly in Nigeria) and distrust between both countries and their nationals. In the light of these findings, it is recommended that Nigeria does not need the wholesome transfer of Israeli technology to the country, but a redirection of its scientific and technological breakthroughs for industrial production purpose. Nigeria needs Israel's assistance for this. Both countries will also derive mutual benefits from economic co-operation. Nigeria can also learn some lessons from Israel's effective means of curtailing religious uprising in its territory. Finally, Israel should not interprete peace with the Palestinians as connoting final peace in the Middle East until she is ready to revisit its Nuclear arms programme, as this is likely to affect its future relations with Nigeria.It is, however, concluded that domestic and not external variables, will most likely dictate the level and extent of deep commitment to the relations, as both countries have realised their need for mutual benefits through the relationships.|Theses collection.|Diplomatic relations/O.A.U. resolutions and reports/political instability/economic co-operation*||||||Aderounmu, Ganiyu Adesola|M|Design and simulation of a digital communication controller for a local area network||||||M.Sc Computer Science|Francis Joseph Ogwu||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Computer Science|1996|||OAU|||||x,141p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

This work describes the design and simulation of a digital communication controller to link two workstations over a distance. Thus providing resource-sharing and improved performance of distributed computer systems to the communities.Various modules of the digital communication controller viz: receiver, transmitter, memory, processor and the handshaking logic interface were specified. Mathematical model was developed for the following modules viz: receiver, transmitter, and memory, using probability distribution theory. The design of the transmitter, receiver, and memory modules were carried out based on the mathematical model developed. A flexible software was designed using assembly programming language and implemented on IBM PS/2 (International Business Machine Personal System 2) model 55SX microcomputer to provide handshaking between the communication controller and a workstation. Simulation of the receiver and the transmitter modules was also carried out based on the mathematical model developed.In the analysis of the communication controller, two models, point-to-point and multidrop were considered. The computer simulation result shows that point-to-point model with a packet size of 1024 bits, a message size of 4096 bits, a bit error rate of 10-9, and a maximum transmission distance of six kilometers between two workstations can be employed as design parameters in the event of actual construction as against the multidrop model. The point-to-point model indicates a communication system that can provide a variety of efficient communication primitives which enhances reliability|Theses collection.|data communication//point-to-point model//multidrop//extensive application*||||||Owokade, Adebola Lekan|M|Assessment of non-residential students' problems in colleges of education in Osun and Oyo state||||||M.A. Ed.

It was carried out as a response to the need to seek viable strategies that could enrich the teaching of library skills to students just entering the tertiary level of education. Two hundred and forty students selected by stratified random sampling were assigned to four groups, A, B, C, and D, each presented with a different learning package. Group A was given the complete package of flowcharted advance organizer plus the learning material. Group B was given the learning material only while Group C was given only the flowcharted advance organizer. Group D was given the placebos. Six hypotheses were generated for the study. With the aid of two instruments, the Library Skills Mastery Test (LSMT) and the Library Skills  Transfer Test (LSTT), data were collected and analysed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the t-tests. The t-tests were followed by further analysis using the Least Significant Difference (LSD) method. All the hypotheses were tested at the 0.05 level of significance.The results of the study revealed that the flowcharted advance organizer plus the learning material group (Group A) did not perform significantly better than the learning material only group (Group B).

It aimed at finding out who controlled such classroom interaction and the strategies used, and at discovering the similarities and differences between patterns of interaction in the science and humanity ESL lessons. The -thesis further investigated how the above objectives could help in improving teaching strategies and pupil communicative ability in an ESL situation.The data for the study were collected from twelve Secondary schools drawn from Oyo, Osun and Ondo States of Nigeria. Four subjects were chosen from the school curriculum and these were: Biology, Chemistry, Economics and English. Audio recordings of lessons in these four subjects were made in each of the schools selected for the study. Discourse analysis approach to naturally occurring conversation was carried out on the texts on the basis of the Birmingham School theory represented in Sinclair and Coulthard (1975), Burton (1981), Berry (1981), Coulthard and Montgomery (1981) and Ventola 11987).The study showed that the teacher controlled and dominated both the science and humanity ESL, lessons. The strategies used by the leachers to control the lessons included simultaneous chorusing of answers by pupils on one hand and by Teacher/Pupil on the other hand as well as the use of hearing checks and reprimand of pupils. The study showed that there was the prevalence of language interlarding/code switching. This was used as a means of making explicit certain concepts that the pupils found difficult to grasp in English and also to check or correct an erring pupil. The study further found that the science and humanity lessons were similar in that they were both structured in terms of Initiation, Response, Feedback (IRF). They were different in the sense that there were more informatives and directives in the science lessons than in the humanities. On the one hand, there was paradiscourse in the sciences but none in the humanities. On the other hand there were more eliciting exchanges in the humanities than in the sciences. The study concluded that in the two lesson types, pupil contributions were fewer than those of the teacher. This was seen as an indication of teacher dominance of ESL classroom lessons.|Theses Collection|Language/Englisg Language/code switching/language interlarding*||||||Ayoade, Dupe Victoria|F|Correlation studies between the levels of lead and tin in soil samples around a lead smelting plant by x-ray fluorescence spectrometry||||||M.Sc.

The extent of the spread of these elements into the soil and along the horizontal distance from the factory site is to be ascertained. Also, the suitability of x-ray fluorescence technique for the analyses of these elements (Pb and Sn) in the soil samples is to be assessed The soil samples were collected at different locations around the lead smelting plant at different distances from the factory site and at different soil depths(0-15, 15-30cm) and at selected control areas( remote from the factory). The samples were dried, ground and made into pelletes, and analyzed with computerized x-ray fluorescence spectrometer. Standard reference materials from national institute for standards and technology were used to determine the precision and accuracy of the technique.Generally, soil samples around the smelting plant (within 1km radius) were found to contain high level of Pb and Sn. The levels of these elements were found to decrease with increasing soil depth and horizontal distance from the factory site. The mean levels of lead and tin in the surface samples (0-15cm) collected at a distance of 50m from the factory were found to be 9499.40.6ppm and 876.132.2ppm respectivelyAt 500m distance, the levels of tin and lead were 253.722.7ppm and 599.32.7ppm respectively. The surface soil lead level was 5,211.80.4ppm at 100m distance from the factory while the levels in the surface soil samples at the farm location, staff quarters,  dam area and administrative block were 186.32.0ppm, 202.71.6ppm, 78.91.1ppm and 342.01.7ppm respectively. The two control soil samples were found to contain 62.74.1ppm and 73.91.4ppm of lead and 103.923.4ppm and 102.727.5ppm of tin in the surface.Judging from the UNEP and WHO tolerance limits for these elements in the soil ( and comparing with the Pb and Sn levels in the control soils) the conclusion was that soil samples around the smelting plant were grossly polluted.|Theses Collection| Makeri Lead/Tin Smelting Company*||||||Arayela, Olatunde|M|Problems and prospects of roadside development in Akure||||||M.Sc, Urban and regional planning|Fadare, S.O.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Urban and regional planning|1996|||OAU|||||xi,102p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The specific objectives of the study include investigations into the factors affecting property development along the main road and a review of the application of planning regulations in relation to development of adjacent facilities along the right-of-way. The technique of accidental sampling survey was used for collecting data and the result of the analysis showed that there were problems of street-trading along the main road as a result of ineffective application of planning regulations.Further findings showed that there were illegal conversions of buildings from one use to another without the approval of the Town Planning Authority, contravention of the regulation on road set-back, the problem of traffic congestion and non-provision of lay by and bus-bays. Other findings include the haphazard presence of mechanic and allied trades workshops along the main road, dumping of refuse along the road curb, and the problem of storm water drainage.  Furthermore, the study revealed irregular water supply, erratic power distribution, inadequate waste disposal system and the problem of renovation of buildings along the road.It is therefore suggested that provision should be made for lay by and bus-bays at the identified bus stops along the main road to ensure a smooth flow of traffic thereby reducing road congestion. Also, the regulation on road set-back should be strictly enforced in order to effectively combat on-street trading and haphazard presence of mechanics and allied workshops along the roads. The research also recommended provision of refuse collection receptacles in front of each building which would be emptied everyday in refuse collection vans to be provided by the government and dumped outside the city where it can be treated. On the illegal conversion of buildings without recourse to the Planning Authority, the research recommended that property developers should always seek the approval of the Planning Authority before embarking on change of use of their previously approved building plans.Furthermore, it recommended provision of functional infrastructural facilities to ensure regular flow of potable water, efficient drainage system and provision of effective sanitary system for each building.|These Collection|Planning standards/planning regulations/Town Planning Authority/traffic congestion/lay by/bus-bays/water drainage/power distribution/waste disposal system/renovation/infrastructural facilities *||||||Theses collectionOluwayemi, Osobusola Rufus |M|The effect of cassava based diets on the growth performance of indigenous pigs||||||M.Sc., Animal Science|Ilori,J.O.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Animal Science|1996|||OAU|||||viii,44p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Cassava meal (CM) at dietary levels of 15 and 30% supported a faster and more efficient rate of growth in pigs than the complete cereal based diet (0% CM) and 45% CM diet. No differences in performance were observed between pigs receiving the control and the 45%' CM diets.The performance of pigs on the 60% CM diet was much lower than that of pigs on the control diet. Overall, pigs receiving the 15%CM diet had a faster and more efficient rate of weight gain than those on all the other treatments.Dry matter digestibility for all the pigs was highest in pigs on the control diet (0%CM) while the pigs on the 15% CM diet had a higher digestibility than those on the 30, 45 and 60%CM diets. No difference was observed in the dry matter digestibility in pigs receiving the 30 and 60%CM diets. Energy digestibility was highest in pigs receiving the 60% CM diet while pigs on the 0,15 and 45% CM diets had similar energy digestability. The efficiency of energy utilization was highest in pigs on the 15% CM diet and lowest in those on the 60% CM diet. The control and 45% CM diets produced efficiency of energy utilization that were similar. The cost of feed/kg decreased as the level of cassava meal in the diet increased. The cost/kg liveweight gain was slightly lower for pigs fed the cassava based diets than the complete cereal based diet.

The study was carried out between August 1990 and May 1993 an follow-up to a preliminary disease survey which in 1988 showed that Schistosoma haematobium was widespread in both communities.A comprehensive census of the communities and a questionnaire assessment of peoples perception of schistosomiasis were undertaken. Individuals were parasitologically examined in April/May 1991 and 1992 using sedimentation and dip strip techniques. Infected persons were treated in 1992 with standard dose praziquantel and school children were re-examined 1 month later for treatment efficacy and 3, 6 and 12 months post treatment for reinfection. Seven water contact sites were surveyed monthly for snails by a scoop and search method. Snails collected were identified to species and examined for Schistosoma infection using the shedding method. Six of the sites were observed quarterly for water contact patterns. Prevalence of infection rose from 30.2% among 650 persons examined in 1991 to 61.6,, among 591 persons examined in 1992. Geometric mean intensity of infection increased from 308 to 355 eggs/10ml urine in 1991 and 1992 respectively. Intensity was highly dispersed as only 20%, of the population excreted 95% and 80% of total egg output in 1991 and 1992 respectively. Infection patterns in 1991 and 1992 were comparable in all sex, village and tribal groups, but prevalence, incidence and intensity of infection in both years were significantly higher in children than in adults, with peaks in the age group 10 - 14 years. Compared with the 1988 situation, pattern of infection had progressed from its initial epidemic state to an endemic  state. Treatment efficacy among children 1 month post treatment 89% parasitology cure and 99.2% reduction in the overall  pretreatment intensity. Reinfection was 9.1%, 19.8% and 41.00% at 3, 6 and 12months post treatment with a tendency to decrease with increasing age. Economic contact activities accounted for 4Q% of most indices of water contact suggesting that alternative water supply might be relevant in stemming G Donal- contact activities.The snail species identified in the reservoir are Bulinus globosus,   B. forskalii, B. truncatus, Lymnaea natalensis, Indoplanorbis exutus and Potadoma spp., but B. globosus was identified as the local intermediate host. Transmission occurred mainly between August/September and December/ January.Factors identified as affecting seasonal and focal distribution of snails are rainfall, temperature, water level and water discharge patterns in the reservoir. In particular, the escalation of transmission between 1991 and 1992 was attributed to a prolonged water conservation during the hot dry season of 1991.|Theses collection.|Endemicity/transmission/schistosomiasis/chemotherapy/praziquantel/population/infection/parasitology *||||||Odejobi, Odetunji Ajadi |M|Simulation modelling of an intelligent linguistic processor for continuous speech recognition||||||M.

Simulation modelling of a continuous speech recognizer is presented in this work.The proposed model consists of linguistically structured components which represent, as much as possible, various aspects of "natural" speech recognition processes. Acoustic phonetics and prosodic characteristics of speech were represented and processed using knowledge-based structures and rule-driven algorithms. Tools and algorithms, such as fuzzy logic, neural-network, Markov algorithm, reinforcement learning algorithm and automata theory were used to produce powerful mechanism for the successful simulation of the system's components. Some of the components of the system namely; the acoustic to phoneme mapping, speech template constructor, learning, and speech recognition modules were simulated using Intel 80X86 Assembler and Borland c++ running on an 80386 based microcomputer system.The test and evaluation mechanism as well as an environment proposed for the system could not be used to generate the performance level of the entire system, since only some of the system's components were simulated.

This centrality took root in the Colonial legislations, which made oil a point of domination in Anglo-Nigerian relations.  However, it moved from a point of domination to a point of hostility, when Britain evolved from a major consumer of Nigerian oil to a major producer of the same variety of crude. This movement of oil from a high point of domination, to a point of hostility, was a result of British displeasure over the Nigerian nationalization of the Barclays Bank and all the assets of the BP in Nigeria. The nature of the hostility and/or competition, was such that the BNOC was underselling the Nigerian oil by the price undercutting of the British Brent.The international and domestic climates in which Nigeria was able to embark on the nationalization of the BP have changed. These changed circumstances paved way for the return of the BP-Statoil into the Nigerian oil industry and an influx of multi-national oil companies of American and French origins.An obvious stronger presence of American and French companies the Nigerian oil industry notwithstanding, the return of the BP significant: in Anglo-Nigerian relations. This is made more significant when the 50% percent ownership of Britain in the Shell Group is considered, moreso with Shell producing more than 50% of t Nigerian 0.1.|Theses Collection|Crude-Oil/energy/politics/international relations/Nigerian oil industry/colonial legislations/nationalisation/Shell Group *||||||Abegunrin, Omotola Omolade|F|Petrophysical evaluation of two reservoir sands in five wells in the western part of the Niger Delta||||||M.Sc.

These include Caliper log, Spontaneous Potential (SP), Gamma ray (GR). Lithodensity log (LDL), Compensated Neutron log (CNL) and Dual Laterolog (DLL) Microspherically Focused (MSFL) combination logs obtained from Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited. The evaluated petrophysical characteristics include porosity, permeability, fluid saturation, formation resistivities, resistivity of water, and reservoir thicknesses among others.Identified lithologies in the wells were sand, shaly sands and shales. The sands are the reservoir rocks while the non reservoir rocks are the shales. Two reservoirs designated A.O and B.O sands were studied in each of the five wells. These sands are separated by thick shale bodies over-lying and underlying each of the sand reservoirs. The A.O sand occurs between 6445ft (1954m) and 6635ft (2022m) while B.O sand occurs between 6684ft (2037m) to 6873ft (2095m). Slaty sands occur intermittently within the larger sand bodies.Gross and net sand thicknesses range from 88ft (27m) to 137f1 (42m) and 76ft (23m) to 126ft (38m) respectively for the A.O. sand, while the values are 89ft (27m) to 126ft (38m) and 71ft (22m) to 114ft (35m) respectively for the B.O sand. Net oil sand ranges from 4f3 (1.2m) to 42ff (13m) and 7ft (2m) to 72ft (22m) for A.O and B.O sands respectively. Both reservoir sands exhibit wide range in grain sizes ranging from very fine grained to coarse grained.The A.O sand porosity ranges from 12.04% to 36.61% with an average of 28% while B.O sand porosity ranges from 18.42% to 34.20% with an average of 26%. Low porosity values were obtained for the shaly sand intervals. In general, both A.O and B.O sands have excellent porosities. Permeability ranges from 0.06 x 102md to 498.07 x 102md with an average of 51.86 x 102md for A.0 sand and from 0.01 x102md to 288.80 x102rnd with an average of 46.61 x 102md for B.O sand.Saturating fluids identified from computed values of water saturation, porosity, resistivity and SP logs were oil and fresh water. Oil occurs on top of water. The oil water contact occurs at different depths in the sands ranging from 6481ft to 6516ft (1975 - 1986m) for A.O sand; and from 6739ft to 6762ft (2054 - 2061m) for B.0 sand.Both reservoir sands in the five wells with the exception of B.O sand in well 2 were found to contain hydrocarbons which in most intervals are moveable. Estimated hydrocarbon reserves total 15.10MMm3 (94.98 MMbbl) for the A.O sand and 11.95MMm3 (75.15MMbbl) for the B.O sand. These are viable reserves which have resulted in their economic exploitation by Shell Petroleum Development Company Nigeria Limited.|Theses Collection|Reservoir sands/Petrophysical evaluation/borehole geogphysical (open hole) logs/fluid saturation/Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited/Niger Delta/Slaty sands/porocity values/hydrocarbons  *||||||Abiola, Asimiyu Gbolagade|M|The impact of deficit budgeting on the economic development of Nigeria. 1970-1991||||||M.Sc.

While deficit budget is not new in the economic history of Nigeria, the rather persistence of the deficits during peace time has been the cause of much concern to most observers of the Nigerian economy. Most of the existing studies on deficit budgeting have been qualitative; with few studies demonstrating any empirical relationship between deficit and economic development. The study therefore attempted to fill this gap by providing an empirical relationship between deficit budgeting and economic development of Nigeria. The question of whether deficit has been self-perpetuating in Nigeria was also addressed.Two models of analysis were specified and estimated. In the first model, we regressed Gross Domestic Product k GDP), on deficit financing, changes in price level and rate of interest. We applied Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method to the time series data. for the period 1970-1991. In the second model, we regressed total public spending, on the share of Federal Government spending financed by taxation, per capita income, total population and per capita consumption. Similarly, we applied Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method to the time series data, for the period 1970-1991.The results of our analysis suggest that deficit financing has a negative impact on GDP, with a one percent increase in deficit financing generating a 4.23 percent decrease in GDP. However, changes in price level and rate of interest were found to have positive relationships with GDP.Also, we found that federal deficits increase federal expenditures. Similarly, an increase each in both per capita income and total population produces a more than proportionate increase in the unit cost of public goods. Our results further suggest a lower growth rate for per capita consumption relative to public consumption. Thus, deficit budgeting has been self-perpetuating in Nigeria. The consistent higher growth rate of public consumption relative to per capita consumption confirms the dominance of public sector in Less Developed Countries.On the whole, deficit budgeting is not undesirable. What is rather undesirable in the Nigerian case, has been deficit, on unproductive activities. Thus, we recommended among other things, that in future, deficits should be expended on productive activities. The rationale behind this position, is that productive activities will be able to generate returns to liquidate both the principal and the interest payable.|Theses Collection|Deficit budgeting/federal expenditures/economic development/Gross Domestic Product/taxation/per capita income/total population/per capita consumption/Less Developed Countries/Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)*||||||Adedeji, Adetayo Victor|M|Preparation and characterization of (Co -V - O and Cr v O) pyrolytically deposited thin films||||||M.Sc.

The films deposited on sodalime glass substrate were characterized using a combination of Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) and Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS) for the identification of the elements present, surface composition study and thickness determination. The deposited thin film with atomic composition CO0..31V1..37 O5 and Cr0.5V2O5 were respectively found to be 166nm and 127nm thick.For the optical characterization, absorption spectra in the ultraviolet/visible region were analysed to obtain the band gap energies of the materials. Direct allowed optical band gap energy of 2.23 eV was obtained for Co-V-O while Cr-V-O showed a phonon assisted transition with an indirect optical band gap energy of 2.05 eV.The electrical characterization using Van der Pauw method of resistivity measurement indicated that the materials: are semiconducting. Contribution to the over-all thermal conductivity resulted from electronic conduction and hopping conduction mechanisms. The activation energies were calculated from suitable plots of natural logarithm against the reciprocal of temperature. The activation energies for Co-V-O and Cr-V-O were obtained to be 0.274eV and 0.403eV respectively for electronic conduction, 0.297eV and 0.431eV respectively for hopping conduction.Thermoelectric effect on the materials showed that both materials are p-type semiconductors.|Theses Collection|Organic metal/Chemical Vapour deposition/metal acetylacetonates/sodalime/Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (EDXRF)/Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS)/atomic composition/ultraviolet/visible region/optical band gap/Van der Pauw method of resistivity/Thermoelectric effect *||||||Oyewale, Adesina Ayobami|M|Evaluation of the problems and prospects of cow milk industry in osun state||||||M.Sc,Technology Policy and planning|Ogbimi, F.E.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Agric Econs|1996|||OAU|||||xi,108p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Milk is rich in protein, but its production and consumption in Nigeria is very low. This study is aimed at assessing the problems facing the dairy industry in Osun State. The study was carried out using the instruments of questionnaires surveys and interviews. The respondents were dairy farms, government officials, herdsmen and residents in Osun State. Their responses were analysed using frequency and percentage estimates.The respondents identified capital, land, pasture, high yielding animals, equipment and trained personnel as necessities for the development of the dairy industry in Osun State. Herding is done in the state in the savanna area only. The herdsmen keep cattle, sheep and goat but milk only cattle. Our survey showed that foreign cows were imported for milk production in some diary farms. These have almost been wiped out by diseases. This has led to the closure of the dairy farms and their associated processing plants. Eighty two percent of the herdsmen surveyed mentioned animal diseases as problems confronting cattle rearers. None of the herdsmen gave concentrates to the animals. Thirty six percent of them reported they did not give grains to the animals because grains are expensive, 34% believed that supplementary feeding is not necessary, while 40% saw supplementary feeding as something contrary to their culture. It was estimated that 10,368 tonnes of milk were produced from cattle while about 540 and 1,000 tonnes could have been obtained from goats and sheep respectively in Osun State in 1994.Among the respondents who said they like taking milk, the largest number preferred evaporated milk, followed by powdered milk and lastly fresh milk. This preference of preserved milk suggests that there is need to popularise fresh milk Consumption. A dairy development model that involves the use of the existing herds of cattle, sheep and goat was developed for Osun State. This model is premised on improving animal health and feeding, upgrading the local herds through artificial insemination and cross breeding, the use of co-operatives as the nuclei of dairy development and the establishment of a coordinating body for milk and dairy production. |Theses Collection|Protein/diets/milk/dairy industry/herdsmen/cattle rearers *||||||Okotoni, Matthew Olu|M|Personnel development in the Nigerian Federal Civil Service with reference to Oyo and Kwara States||||||Ph.D, Public Administration|Ayo, Samuel Bamidele ||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Public Aministration|1996|||OAU|||||xii,226p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The thrust of the thesis is that effective distribution and utilization of personnel is a sine-quanon for the success of any organization.Both primary and secondary sources of data collection were employed for the study. The primary data include questionnaire, interview, analysis of records and documents and participant observations. Other data sources include Library documents (i.e. bibliographical studies, and comparative studies in published and un-published works) statistical package programme was used for the analysis to determine percentages, means and standard deviation.The study discovered that competent personnel required to carry out social and economic services at the state and local government levels are either not available or are grossly inadequate. This is because, they tend to concentrate at the headquarters in Lagos up to 1990 and Abuja since 1992. As a result of this, the Federal Government has not succeeded in making significant impact on the lives of the common people either in terms of service delivery or mobilization for productive activities. The retention of civil servants in the headquarters has been influenced by factors like access to more authority and power by the civil servants and availability of more facilities and privileges for them. This position validates our first hypothesis which stated that, the concentration of senior federal civil servants in the headquarters is strongly connected with the lack of power, authority, privileges and incentives for officers in the field.The study also discovered that it is those states that harbour more of federal projects that attract larger federal personnel. In this perspective, Oyo State is an empirical example. Our second working hypothesis is therefore validated.It was observed as well that the activities of the field offices are hampered by problems related to finance; poor communication; lack of incentives; lack of vehicles and equipment; social effect of transfer; inadequate office and residential accommodation; language and cultural barrier; poor staffing; lack of free hand to operate, etc. In concluding, a number of recommendations were proffered. These include - adequate, regular and timely funding; improved communication; adequate delegation; the need for more effective deconcentration of personnel; effective coordination of field services among the various federal ministries and the various tiers of government in Nigeria; better remunerations and incentives; more equipment and vehicles; greater autonomy; a more decent office and residential accommodation for field officers; regular feedback from the headquarters; etc.|Theses collection.|Administration/Nigerian Federal Civil Service/service delivery/mobilization/authority/power/incentives *||||||Onipede, Anthony Oladehinde|M|A comparative study of the bacteria isolates from clinical specimens obtained from patients in four university teaching hospital in south-western Nigeria.||||||M.Sc, Microbiology|Ako-nai, K.A.//Lamikanra, A.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Microbiology|1996|||OAU|||||x,114p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The primary isolation media used were blood agar, eosin-methylene blue agar, mannitol salt agar and sabouraud dextrose agar. The isolates were identified based on cultural, morphological and biochemical characteristics. Final identification was based on the API 10s kit. Antibiotic susceptibility pattern of bacteria was determined by the disc diffusion method.The general pattern of consecutive specimens received from the teaching hospitals showed a similar trend. Mid stream urine was the most common specimen received, accounting for 40.5% of the entire specimens.Pathogenic organisms isolated from the respective hospital were relatively similar but the frequency of recovery of each species varied from one hospital to another. Fifteen different genera of micro-organisms were cultured in all. These include Escherichia, Citrobacter, Klebsiella,	Enterobacter,  Proteus, Pseudomonas, Aeromonas. Others are Salmonella,  Shigella,  Arizona,  Serratia,  Yersinia,   Vibrio,  Edwards Ella and Staphylococcus.The result of this study showed that the most prevalent group of micro-organism were the Gram - negative bacilli which accounted for 78.23% of the total isolates; in contrast, Gram - positive organisms contributed only 21.87%. Aeromonas (11.70%) in this study is of interest and it highlights the emerging role of this organism in urinary tract infection in the hospital setting. A variety of micro-organisms were recovered from wound swabs; however, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common single isolate (28.9%).The antibiotic resistance patterns of the bacterial isolates cultured in this study were compared. The majority of the organisms had multiple resistance to the antibiotics commonly prescribed in the hospital under study. A total of 81.3% bacterial isolates tested were resistant to ampici l l in, 81.1% to trimethoprim, 85.9% to tetracycline, 90.3% to sulphasomudine, while 73.10% of isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol and 43.2% to gentamicin.In conclusion, the study shows the similarity of pathogenic organisms isolated from clinical specimens from the teaching hospitals studied. It also highlightedthe emerging role of Aeromonas as a nosocomial pathogen. The in-vitro sensitivity testing of isolates also revealed the prevalence of multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria to commonly employed antibiotics in the South Western region of Nigeria. Therefore a continuous surveillance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents with a view to containing their spread is recommended.|Theses Collection|Micro-organisms/hospitals/mannitol salt agar/sabouraud dextrose agar/pathogenic/urine/Staphylococcus aureus/Aeromonas/gentamicin/antimicrobial agents*||||||Adesola, Emmanuel Funsho|M|An analysis of Nigeria's external relations with international financial institutions||||||M.Sc, International Relations|Soremekun, Kayode||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, International Relations|1996|||OAU|||||xi,133p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The two international financial institutions were established on July 22, 1944. at independence in 1960, Nigeria formally joined both the IMF and World Bank. Since then, the countrys experience within the two institutions has been a mixture of understanding and confrontation.The study, critically evaluates the origins, structures and modes of operation of the two Bretton Woods institutions as well as their activities and involvement in Nigeria. Furthermore, it dwells on how the two institutions are controlled. The politics of Structural Adjustment Programme (ASP) are evaluated and a prognosis of dimensions which Nigeria  IMF/World Bank relations may likely take offered. The study reveals that due to the circumstances that led to the establishment of these Bretton Woods institutions, the major characters that were instrumental to their formation of those members with highest quota in the two institutions utilize them in order to promote their respective core or selfish interests. This is done to the detriment of Nigeria and other Third World countries within the periphery of the international system.As a result of the foregoing, the interaction between Nigeria and the Bretton Woods twins (the IMF and the World Bank) will continue to be characterized by co-operation at a time, disagreement at another.

In addition, the thesis attempted to ascertain how the forms of arguments identified in these treatises could have influenced the pupils of the Sophists to become sceptics.The methodology employed was textual critical analysis and philosophical argumentation. Protagoras' "The Myth of Protagoras", the Homo Mensura dictum as expressed in Plato's Theaetetus and Gorgias' "Encomium on Helen" and the treatise "On Nature or The Non-Existent" were studied. The interpretations of these works in books and journals were also critically examined.The thesis found that Protagoras used a series of arguments in such a way that no member of the arguments in the series turned out to be absolutely valid: Each of them needed correction or support in one form or another. It was discovered that Gorgias used arguments to eliminate all possible grounds for holding that a knowledge claim can be true without qualification. The thesis concluded that diligent pupils who studied these arguments either by rote or by rigorous analysis, in order to emulate the way they are adduced could plausibly have developed a strong disposition to adopt the Sophistic Scepticism which informed the arguments they studied.|Theses Collection|Persuasive arguments/Protagoras/Gorgias/models/treatise/sophists/sceptics/Philosophy*||||||Adeyefa, Zachariah Debo |M|Spectral investgations of solar irradiance under Arctic and Tropical weather situations||||||Ph.D. Physics|J.A.

The main objective was to gain a good insight into solar radiation and atmospheric turbidity characteristics from the measurements of the direct, global and diffuse spectral and broad-band irradiances under the two weather regimes.The experiments were carried out at Abisko (68 21' N, 18 49' E, about 200 km north of the Arctic Circle in northern Sweden) between 1990 and 1994 and at Ile-Ife (7 30'N, 4 31'E, south western Nigeria) between December 1991 and February 1992. The Angstrom atmospheric turbidity coefficients p, 0.5 (referring to atmospheric turbidity at 1um and 0.5m respectively) and a (wavelength exponent closely associated to the size of the scattering particles and the frequency of their distribution) for the wavelength interval, 350-1038 nm were derived from series of spectroradiometric measurements both at Abisko and at Ile-Ife.The Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption of June 1991 in the Philippines, led to a significant increase in the average values of B (from 0.03 in 1990 to 0.14 in 1992) and P05 (from 0.07 to 0.17) at Abisko. The mean value of the coefficient, a, decreased from 1.18 (before the eruption) to 0.21 (after the eruption). Consequently, there was a considerable decrease in the direct irradiance especially in the visible region, varying between 18% and 30% at solar elevations of 40 and 15 respectively. The change in the total radiation was less than for the direct irradiance (about 1.4% and 8% at solar elevation angles of 40 and 15 respectively). It is shown, that the largest decrease in atmospheric turbidity occurred within March/April 1992 and September/October 1993. Results obtained up to July 1994, indicate that the turbidity values are almost back to their pre-Pinatubo magnitudes.The values of the turbidity parameters , and 0.5 for Ile-Ife between December, 1991 and February 1992 are high with averages of 1.09 and 1.41 respectively while the average value of a was about 0.5. The mean background harmattan conditions had values ranging from 1.02 (at 350 nm) to 0.54 (at 862 nm) while the spell conditions had higher turbidities varying between 1.87 at 350 nm and 1.44 at 862 nm. There was a severe reduction in the direct solar irradiance at Ile-Ife during this period while a significant increase in the diffuse radiation was observed. The global irradiance though reduced, was less sensitive to changing harmattan conditions. The parameters  and 0.5 have been shown to decrease when the Inter-Tropical Discontinuity (ITD) moves north of a station during the harmattan period and to increase when it migrates south of it. Deviations from the Angstrom law were observed (at Abisko and at Ile-Ife) when a decreased to about 0.2.This study shows that flat-plate solar energy devices that use radiation from sun and sky should be used under changing harmattan conditions rather than concentrators which use only the direct component. The deviations from the Angstrom law indicate that the Angstrom law is not valid for all characteristics of atmospheric aerosols and also emphasize the importance of using multi-spectral regression methods for the determination of a and B in preference to the Volz technique. The spectral and broad-band database resulting from this work could be used as a source of "ground truth" for satellite remote sensing applications as well as inputs for solar radiation modelling studies.|Theses Collection|Solar radiation/Arctic and Tropical weather conditions/atmospheric turbidity/wavelenght/Angstrom atmospheric turbidity coefficients/spectroradiometric/Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption/ Inter-Tropical Discontinuity (ITD)/Volz technique *||||||Momodu, Justin Ibhafidon |M|Studies of the use of hammer mill for size reduction of cassava in gari production||||||M.Sc, Agricultural Engineering|Ige, M.T.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Agricultural Engineering|1996|||OAU|||||xii, 113p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Reported output from the hammer mills are usually based on grains of below 16% moisture content wet basis. Cassava tuber has moisture of about 60-70% wet basis. The use of the hammer mill in the size reduction of cassava tuber in gari production will contribute immensely to the knowledge of wet milling operation. It is also an added advantage to the various uses of the hammer mill and give to the cassava processors an industrial machine.A hammer mill was constructed for the grinding of cassava tubers and pulverization of dewatered cassava mash in gari production. Effect of parameters such as number of hammers, rotor speed and screen opening on throughput capacity and mash density, moisture content and the particle size of cassava mash and pulverized product were investigated, and compared with that from conventional methods (grating of cassava tubers using graters and pulverization using sieves). A 4x3x4 factorial experiment was designed to permit the screening of the effect of three variables on the mill grinding performance.Statistical test of significance shows no significant effect of treatments on mash density. The effect of increase in number of hammers on cassava cake moisture content was significant at 95 % confidence level (P < 0.05). Increasing the rotor speed and screen sizes seems not to affect the moisture content of pressed cassava mash. Analysis of the effect of the factors on the fineness modulus (F M.). shows that the effect of number of hammers and increasing rotor speed were highly significant at 99% confidence level (P < 0.01), while screen opening was only significant at P < 0.05. The effects reveals that, increasing number of hammers and rotor speed resulted in decrease in F.M., while increase in screen diameter resulted in increase in F.M.Using the hammer mill as a pulverizer, the results of the effects of screen opening on the moisture content (M.C) and fineness modulus (F.M) of pulverized cassava cake shows a decrease over the initial cassava cake M.C. of 51.55% and F.M. of 4.68 as the screen opening decreases (from 12, 10, 8 and 6 mm 4.).  Percent decreases of M.C. over the initial were 0.1, 2.6, 3.5 and 7.1 respectively for 12, 10, 8 and 6 mm diameter screen. While percent decrease of F.M. over the initial were 14, 50, 54 and 108 for 12, 10, 8 and 6 mm diameter screen respectively.The hammer mill throughput values are significantly greater than the conventional methods values in grinding and pulverization. The difference is highly signficant at 95% confidence level. The screening of the effect of the two pulverization methods on the moisture content and the fineness modulus of the products shows some level of difference in moisture content of the pressed cassava mash granulated by the hammer mill as compared with the sample manually sifted. The treatment do not appear to have any effect on fineness modulus and uniformity index of the pulverized sample.|Theses Collection|Cassava/hammer mill/wet milling/gari/cassava mash *||||||Fejamilehin, Adenike Olubunmi|F|The relationship between psychological stress and sports injuries among athletes in Obafemi Awolowo University||||||M.A.Ed.

A total of 154 subjects, made up of 77 male and 77 female athletes took part in the study. A modified form of the Social and Athletic Re-adjustment Rating Scale (SARRS) questionnaire by Bramwell et. al (1975), with 7 items was used to gather date for the Study. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics, and Pearson product correlational analysis.The results showed that the most frequently perceived stressful events are sport injury, examination stress, good result of team, first selection into team; change in eating and sleeping habits, changes in familiar residence, separation from former friends, separation from boy/girl friend and financial independence. The study also showed a positive and low but  non-significant relationship between the stress scores and  frequency of injuries. The relationship was however associated with the sex of subjects and type of sports. Female subjects sustained more injuries while under stress than male subjects did, Also athletes in non-contact sports had more injuries when under stress than athletes in contact sports.|These Collection|Sports/injuries/stress/eating/sleeping habits/financial independence*||||||Fatoba, Paul Ojo|M|Reproductive biology of selected tropical mosses in South-Western Nigeria||||||Ph.D, Botany|Odu, E.A.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Botany|1996|||OAU|||||xi,116p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The study was carried out to investigate the reproductive strategies of mosses in the prevailing non-uniform, unstable habitats.The mosses: Thuidium gratum (P. Beauv.) Jaeg; Hyophila involuta Hook Jaeg; Stereophylhun radiculosum Hook Mitt; Racopilum africanum Mitt; Bryum coronatum Schwaegr; Barbula lambarenensis (Hook) Spreng.; Calymperes ufzelii Octoblepharum albidum Hedw and Bryum cruegeri Hampe., were sampled fortnightly from their various substrates and scored for the presence or absence and the stage of development of sex organs and sporophytes. Viability test of the spores of these selected mosses were carried out by determining their percentage spore germination. Spores. gemmae and regenerants or vegetative parts of these mosses were dispersed onto their respective natural substrates to determine their effectiveness in shoot establishment. Spore output and spore sizes of these mosses were determined by using haemacytometer counting chamber and Ocular micrometer respectively. The effect of photoperiods on gamete formation were also investigated by subjecting B. coronatum and H. involuta, the two commonest mosses producing sporophytes, freely to different light periods.Results showed that all the selected mosses except B. cruegeri are fertile. In addition, B. lambarenensis, H. involuta and C. afzelii are superfertiles (reproduce asexually and sexually). All these mosses are also perennial except H. involuta that is an annual. Phenological studies showed that the fertile mosses follow a defined sequential reproductive cycle that  lasted for a maximum months except B. lambarenensis that reproduces sexually at alternative years, Production of gemmae was found to be more, correlated with dioecism than inability to fruit, No momoeciuos species was found to produce gemmae. Gemmae were found to be more effective than spores in the establishment of new moss population. However, coronatum can successfully be propagated through spores on natural substrates. Estimates from the spore output and spore sizes showed an inverse relationship between these two variables. All the selected mosses are homsporous except C. afzelii that was anisosporous. Photoperiods and water availability (rainfall) are important factors in the sexual reproductive cycle of B. coronatum and H. involuta. The problem of fluctuating environmental factors coupled with the welldefined Contrasting dry and rainy seasons would certainly make the mosses  develop adequate reproductive strategies to ensure their survival in these study areas.|Theses Collection|Habitat/mosses/sex organs/sporophytes/haemacytometercounting chamber/Ocular micrometer/Gemmae/Photoperiods  *||||||Mohammed, Mairo Balaraba|M|The role of seaports in the economic and political integration of the West African sub-region||||||M.Sc.

The criteria for regionalism could be geographical, economic or ideological, or a combination of all these factors, In the light of this, this study examines the role of seaports in the integration of the West African Sub-region: using the "sectoral integration approach" in its analysis. It traces the historical background of seaports in West Africa, with particular attention on Nigerian and Senegalese Seaports.This is to enable us understand the differences and similarities in their patterns of development, and assert the importance of seaports in the development of nations.Selected regional and international organisations connected with seaport activities were also examined. They are, the Port Management Association of West and Central Africa, the International Cargo-Handling Co-ordination Association, the International Association of Ports and Harbours, the international Maritime Organisation and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,The data used were obtained from official reports and interview method, particularly from personnel connected with seaport activities. Secondary data were obtained from published and unpublished works and seminar papers on the subject.The findings in this study confirm that, integration of the West African sub-region can he achieved if the strategic and economic importance of seaports are explored to the fullest; especially when all the seaports offer series of integrated and complementary services and their development is made a question of national priority, Finally, the study offers some suggestions to policy makers in government as well as ports administrators on how seaports could further enhance the integration of the West African sub-region, for instance, introduction of uniform tariffs, rules and regulation.|Theses Collection|International system/regional integration/transportation/seaports/habours/international Maritime Organisation/United Nations Conference on Trade and Development*||||||Oba, Adeyemi Oladele|M|Foraminiferal biostratigraphy and palaeoecology of strata penetrated by ete-1 and bonny-5 wells, Niger Delta||||||M.Sc, Applied Geology|Salami M.B||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Geology|1996|||OAU|||||xii,107p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

A total of 105 ditch cutting samples from the two wells were analysed for their foraminiferal content using the conventional method of hand rubbing under tap.Based on the planktonic foraminiferal fauna a Late Miocene age was assigned to the two wells. Two informal biostratigraphic zones were erected for each well based on planktonic foraminifers.In Ete-1 well, the informal planktonic foraminiferal zones are Orbulina universa - Globigerinoides praebulloides whilst	in	Bonny-5	well, Orbulina  suturalis Globigerinoides immaturus and Globigerina nepenthes Globigerinoides ruber zones were established.Three informal benthonic foraminiferal zones each were established for the two wells. In Ete-1 well, the zones are Florilus costiferus - Clavelloides tenuistriata zone, Textularia sp. - Lenticulina rotulata zone and Lagena sulcata - Eggerella bradyi zone. In Bonny-5 well, the zones are Heterolepa - pseudoungeriana - Ouinqueloculina rhodiensis zone, Lenticulina rotulata - Heterolepa crebbsi zone and Lenticulina inornata - Nodosaria raphanistrum zone. Analysis of the benthonic foraminifera for bathymetry and the Planktonic - Benthonic (P/B) ratio for the two wells revealed a gradual decrease in bathymetry between the basal and upper sections of the wells, with a distinct tendency towards sequential shallowing in water depth. This was attributed to a probable higher rate of sediment fill relative to subsidence rate. Further palaeoecological analysis revealed that the sea which deposited the sediments in the two wells was warm and for most part of the time was of normal marine salinity. The inferred environment of deposition based on the ecology of some dominant foraminiferal faunas in the lower sections of the wells was a continental shelf marine environment. The upper sections with paucity of foraminiferal fauna and P/B ratio of less than 0.1 indicate a nearshore transitional environment of deposition.|These Collection|Biostratigraphy/palaeoecology/planktonic foraminifers/marine environment/bathymetry/deposition *||||||Fatoke, Louwaseyi Adedamola|M|Depositional environments and provenance of sediments penetrated by wells in the niger delta||||||M.Sc, Applied Geology|Adediran, S.A// Rahaman M.A.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Geology|1996|||OAU|||||xii, 155p|||||||||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

They have largely ignored the question of whether couples have access to family planning services or not. And experience has shown that an essential pre-requisite for effective family planning programmes is person-to-person education.The study examined the contribution of attendance at prenatal care classes to family planning use. Two hypotheses were tested. The first is that that the higher the number of prenatal care visits, the more the use of modern contraceptive; and the second is that there is a positive relationship between demographic, socioeconomic and motivational variables and modern contraceptive use.A random sampling of 500 women with at least two live births attending prenatal health care clinic in Ilesa were interviewed. Data collection took place between the months of April and May, 1995. Data analysis was done using SPSS PC + Version 4.0 and various statistical techniques such as frequency distribution and cross-tabulations were used to explain the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the respondents.The study revealed that the use of any method was greatest among women in the 20 - 29 age range.

Forestry resources in Nigeria have been depleted to the point of exhaustion and high forest is in great danger of becoming extinct due to various human activities. This study was therefore designed to examine the forest policy in South western Nigeria, evaluate the implementation of the policy, and investigate the effect of forest policy on supply of wood and wood products and the ecosystem.Data were collected from foresters, farmers/hunters and saw-millers/timber contractors in South western States of Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, Osun, Ondo Edo and Delta States. Both Structured and unstructured questionnaires and personal indepth interviews were used to collect information from the respondents. The sample for the study comprises 297 foresters, 70 farmers hunters and 35 saw millers/timber contractors. The data were thereafter analysed with percentage, liken scale and correlation co-efficient.The result showed that the implementation of the policy was hindered by frequent changes in government, political opposition during implementation, inadequate financing and lack of incentives for foresters. Out of 24 roles which the Federal government was expected to perform in respect of forestrysub-sector, only 33.7% of the respondents agreed that the Federal government promoted wildlife species multiplication schemes while 35.4% also agreed thatnational wildlife development activities were adequately co-ordinated. In the case of State governments, only 33.7% of the respondents agreed that the enactment and enforcement of wildlife legislation was adequately performed, while 16.8/a agreed that the establishment of green-belts in urban area were adequately performed. With the compliance of forest policy by farmers, timber contractors/saw-millers and hunters, there were lots of malpractices. These were encroachment on reserved forests by farmers, illegal felling of trees and bush burning. The malpractices contributed to deforestation.Emphases should be placed on reversing the trend of deforestation in the South because the major problems which impede the implementation of forestry programmes in South Western Nigeria are deforestation and wood energy problems. There should be an intensive public enlightenment campaign to ensure that the major cause of ecological problems-man-is sufficiently made aware of his responsibility to nature, his fellow human being and his environment.

The objective of this work was to degrade crude oil in mineral salts medium of equal concentration of nitrogen from different sources namely; Urea, Potassium nitrate and Ammonium sulphate and to calculate the extent of degradation with time for each medium. The organism of choice was Pseudomonas aeruginosa because of its substrate versatility.Three mineral salts media of equal concentration of nitrogen from different sources (Urea, Potassium nitrate and Ammonium sulphate) were prepared and sterilised. Each medium was then inoculated with a pure culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa after the addition of filtered and sterilised crude oil. Fermentation in shake flasks was done for each medium for two weeks at 150rpm and 30C. Samples were withdrawn every 48 hours and analysed on gas chromatograph to show the extent of degradation.At the end of the experiment, Pseudomonas aeruginosa had degraded the crude oil and 87.6% of the original crude oil introduced into Urea medium disappeared. In Potassium nitrate and Ammonium sulphate media, 87 and 86.5% of the initial crude oil introduced disappeared respectively Also, it was found that the initial rates of degradation were 1.8, 1.6 and 1.5 hr -1 for Urea, Ammonium sulphate and Potassium nitrate respectively.|Theses collection| microbial growth/substrate versatility/Fermentation / gas chromatograph/*||||||Idowu, Thomas Oyebode|M|Bioactivity-guided fractionation of acalypha hispida burm||||||M.Sc, Pharmaceutical Chemistry|Ogundaini, A.O.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Phamaceutical Chemistry|1996|||OAU|||||ix, 78p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

It is also used as a laxative and in the treatment of asthma. Preliminary antimicrobial screening in our laboratory on 50% aqueous ethanolic extracts of six Acalypha plants showed that A. hispida and A. wilkensiana possess a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity. The literature evidence butressed by our own initial screening encouraged detailed investigation into the bioactive compounds of A. hispida leaves.A 50% aqueous ethanol extract of A. hispida leaves was partitioned between water and the following organic solvents viz:- chloroform, ethylacetate, and n-butanol. Acetone precipitation of the aqueous crude extract was also effected. The aqueous and organic fractions of each solvent were subjected to antimicrobial screening using E. coli, Ps. aeruginosa, S. aureus and B. subtilis to situate activity. n-Butanolic fraction was found to be the most active of all the fractions tested.

Among the various reform efforts which have been undertaken in this direction, the 1988 civil service reforms has been the most elaborate and far-reaching. The linchpin of the reform package was the professionalization policy which sought to, among other things, train and develop civil servants to acquire relevant professional knowledge, skill, attitudes and ethical norms of behaviour in order to enhance their job performance.Accordingly, training and manpower development is now a primary focus of attention in the civil service of all the states in the federation, that of the Delta State inclusive, and at the federal level. However, the adequacy of the current approach in the Delta State civil service has emerged as an issue of concern among civil servants in the system. The study therefore sought to critically assess the approach with a view to identifying the inherent problems as well as advance suggestions to assist the process to achieve the goals of the professionalization policy in the state civil service and indeed, the Nigerian civil service in general.Essentially, the methodology adopted for assessing the current approach to training and manpower development in the state civil service was historical, theoretical, descriptive and statistical. Primary data were sourced through the use of questionnaire, interviews/discussions with relevant civil servants and participant observation. On the other hand, secondary data were obtained from official documents in Ministries/Extra-Ministerial Departments in the state civil service as well as other published and unpublished works.The findings of the study confirmed that the current approach to training and manpower development in the state civil service is inadequately planned. The position, among other findings, was revealed by the fact that the selection of training and development programme was usually not informed by the identification of the needs of staff. Staffs were usually sponsored to undertake programmes in which they had earlier indicated interest. Another significant finding was that the attitudes of a preponderance of staff were not supportive of the training and manpower development process. Indeed, most civil servants have no confidence in the process as being capable of assisting them to acquire relevant professional competence, attitudes and ethical behaviours requisite to enhance their job performance.Obviously, the continuation of the approach to training and manpower development in the state civil service portends grave dangers for the achievement of the goals of the professionalization policy. Accordingly, possible solutions to the problems inherent in the approach are suggested.|Theses Collection|Nigerian civil service/military administrations/professionalization policy/job performance/manpower development *||||||Ikwuka, Nneka Angelique|F|A study of enhanced oil recovery potential of nigerian reservoirs||||||M.Sc.

The potential of these processes for improved recovery from Nigerian oil reservoirs has been evaluated. Specific cases studied are the virgin, light oil reservoirs (C-2 and C-3 sands) in Ewan field, heavier oil reservoirs (D3.000E, D5.000A and E 1.000E sands) in Ekulama field and water flooded light oil reservoirs (D-4 and D-7 sands) in Agbada field.Process screening criteria were first applied to available reservoir data and this resulted in the assignment of steam, CO2 and polymer processes to the Ewan, but only CO2 process to Agbada and Ekulama subject reservoirs. Incremental oil recoverable from each reservoir - process combination was then estimated using appropriate analytical predictive models. Sensitivity studies were also carried out to assess the effects associated with changes in the operating pressure, fluid injection rate, pattern area and other important reservoir and process parameters.Peak recoveries were found to exhibit remarkable sensitivity to operating parameters. At the basecase conditions, with 124.2 acres pattern spacing, it was established that oil recoveries up to 15%, 20% and 45% original oil in place (OOIP) corresponding respectively to more than 0.20 STB of oil/MCF of CO2, 0.75 BBL of oil/bbl of steam and 15STB of oil/lb of polymer are attainable by CO2, steam and polymer injection processes in Ewan C-2 and C-3 reservoirs, with the C-3 exhibiting greater potential. In the Ekulama cases, oil recovery by miscible CO2 process was highest in E 1.000E sand reaching 24% OOIP as compared to less than 2% and 6% in D3.000E and D5.000A sands respectively.

However, apartheid by its nature generates violence. The violence goes beyond the borders of the apartheid enclave. With the collapse of other racist and colonial regimes in Southern states of Zimbabwe, Angola and other Frontline states, the South African government extended its repression beyond its borders_ The Frontline states have therefore, been forced into defensive counter - measures, in efforts to stem the tide of aggression through military, economic and diplomatic strategies_ The work thus examines the wind of change currently blowing across the south African enclave and how the dismantling of apartheid would give room for new policies to be formulated within and outside South Africa.The finding however reveals that the international system is dynamic. The change in South Africa has been brought about by changes that are happening allover the world. For instance, the demise of the Soviet Union and worldwide movement for democratization have made the continuation of apartheid virtually impossible.The work then speculates that the end of apartheid will withdraw the common enemy which has been part of the glue that binds the Frontline states together. It concludes with suggestions for a peaceful and accommodative Southern Africa in a' post apartheid era.|Theses Collection|violence/democritization*||||||Latinwo, Ismaila|M|Source-receptor characterization of the particulate emissions in delta steel complex, ovwian-aladja, warri and its environs||||||M.Sc.

Outside the Complex, within the neighborhood, the average wet and dry seasonal TSPM loadings measured are 52.9g/m3 and 280.5g/m3 respectively. The mean TSPM concentration decreased exponentially with increasing distance from the shopfloor to farther locations.The following elements were present in most of the samples: Al, Si, P, CI, K, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn and Na while these ones, which were also highly enriched outside and within the Complex at the two seasons, are distinctly shown as DSC dust marker elements: Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Fe Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, Co and As.Concentrations of toxic trace elements such as Cu, Mn, Co, As, V, Pb and possibly Ni, Cr and Zn were observed to have values 1 to 10 times their maximum allowable levels at bothseasons within the Complex and at outside locations less than 10km. Toxicity potentials (TP) values of unity and above were observed at locations within the workarea while values less than unity occurred at other locations during the wet seasons. In the dry season, TP values above unity were reported at all locations.The predictions produced contributions from the following sources, within the Complex, at dry season: fugitive solidified-iron-cutting, hot flame (42.5%), iron and steel-making process dust (27.2%), marine sprays (22.3%), Ovwian-Aladja soil (6.5%), lime-making process dust (1.4%) and the vehicular exhaust (0.1%). During the wet season, the source-contributors are iron and steel-making process dust (67.5%), the iron-cutting hot flame (30.2%), lime-making process dust (1.1%), marine sprays (0.7%) and vehicular exhaust (0.5%). Outside the Complex, during the dry season, the contributors are marine sprays (93.7%), Ovwian-Aladja soil (3.5%), DSC dust (1.2%), paint dust (0.6%), oil/fuel combustion (0.5%) and vehicular exhaust (0.4%). During the wet season, the sources are DSC dust (54.1%), oil/fuel combustion (24.3%), marine sprays (18.7%), vehicular exhaust (11.1%) and paint (1.8%).The findings of this study imply that fugitive and process emissions have pronounced impact on the air quality of the steel complex while the complex itself contributes appreciably to the air particulate of its neighbourhood (up to 3km) at full operation.|Theses collection.|total suspended particulate matter (TSPM)/Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA)/Toxicity potentials (TP)*||||||Babalola, Chinedum Peace |M|Pharmacokinetic studies of quinine in man||||||Ph.D, Phamaceutical Chemistry|Ogunbona, F.A.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Phamaceutical Chemistry|1996|||OAU|||||xiii, 240p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

There were no available pharmacokinetic data of quinine in African subjects prior to the commencement of this study. With the renewed interest in quinine such data are essential for the rational clinical use of the drug. Thus, the pharmacokinetics of quinine was investigated in Nigerian subjects in order to provide a pharmacokinetic data bank towards effective use of this antimalaria drug in the sub-continent.A simple, sensitive and specific reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed for the analysis of quinine in biological fluids. The method, which was used to study the pharmacokinetics of quinine in healthy volunteers and patients, resolved quinine from its major metabolite, 3-hydroxyquinine, and its isomer, quinidine.After single doses of 500 mg quinine were administered to three groups of twenty volunteers in a parallel design study as the intravenous infusion, capsule and tablet preparations, quinine was well absorbed from the capsule preparations with a bioavailability of almost 80% and above while a bioavailability of about 40% was observed for the tablet. The various pharmacokinetic parameters computed following intravenous and oral administration of the drug were not significantly different (p > 0.05) thus suggesting that the route of administration may not affect the disposition of quinine in man. Higher blood quinine levels were observed in the subjects when compared with reports of similar studies from Southeast Asia thus suggesting the possibility of inter-ethnic variation in the disposition of quinine.An oral dose of 10 mg/kg of quinine gave parasite and fever clearance times of 36.0  6.92 h and 18.0  2.68 h respectively, indicating therapeutic efficiency in acute uncomplicated malaria. A comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters during malaria and after recovery revealed consistently higher plasma quinine levels in malaria with more than a two-fold increase in plasma AUC and more than a two-fold reduction in oral clearance (Clp/F) and apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F).After a single oral administration of 500 mg quinine to four volunteers, the tmax and t112 of quinine in saliva and plasma were similar (p > 0.1). A good correlation (r = 0.93) was also observed between saliva and simultaneous plasma levels of quinine. The results indicate that quinine is transferred into saliva by a passive process and that saliva may prove useful for therapeutic drug monitoring of quinine in man.After single oral doses of 250, 500, 750 and 1000 mg quinine to seven volunteers in a randomized cross-over design, increases in Cma and AUC were linear and proportional to the doses (r2 > 0.9). The tmax, t12, Vd/F and Clp/F values were all similar, regardless of the dose (p > 0.05). The occurrence of side effects of the drug was dose dependent. These findings suggest that quinine disposition is linear and not capacity-limited over the dose range studied.|Theses collection.|falciparum malaria,WHO, d-phase, antimalari, metabolite, 3-hydroxyquinine, plasma AUC *||||||Omotosho, Mashood O.|M|A study of the current peace initiative in the middle east||||||M.Sc, International Relations|Ojo, Olusola||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, International Relations|1996|||OAU|||||ix, 117p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

It, in particular, focuses on the Madrid Conference of October 1991 which not only blazed the trail for subsequent peace negotiations in Washington and various part of Europe and the Middle East but more specifically laid down provisions for resolving the conflicts of the past.Using information gathered from primary sources such as official statements and white paper reports on the Middle East crisis, (From the major actors involved in the peace process) as well as extensive library research, the study sheds important light on the instrumental roles played by major international powers, especially the United States of America. Furthermore, the changes in the contemporary World Order (i.e. the end of the cold war, Gulf Crisis) considerably expand the space for dialogue in the Middle East.As the study reveals, peace in the Middle East may, in the short and long terms be a tortuous and elusive quest in view of the discordant interests and activities of Israeli right wing hardliners.

This study became expedient by reason of the fact that, while the need for an organised and systematic approach to training and development in the Public Sector has been stressed in the literature of management and administration, there exist no attempt at linking ineffectiveness in training and development to staff attitudes. This was considered a gap in the body of knowledge, which this study sought to fill.The methodology	employed	for this study was theoretical, descriptive and statistical. Both primary and secondary sources of data were used for this study. Primary data were collected through questionnaire and interview methods, while secondary data were collected from relevant library and documentary sources.In our discussion of the management training and development system and practice of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, this study identified and highlighted the indices of ineffectiveness in the system (management training and development) as inadequate and unsystematic planning,un- organised implementation and apparent negligence of evaluation. Our observation and available objective data also revealed that the absence of adequate and systematic planning, organised implementation and appropriate evaluation, is a product of lack of true support and commitment to management training and development by both top management and trainees.Also, in our assessment of the level of top management commitment, our study found out that there exists a generally low level of commitment by top management to management training and development in the Corporation. In like manner, the findings of our study showed that trainees are not favourably pre-disposed towards management training and development in the Corporation. Thus the findings of the study indicated that there exists a relationship between staff attitudes and the level of ineffectiveness in the management training and development system of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.Essentially, the study made some useful recommendations that could bring about an effective management training and development system in the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. In this direction, it was recommended that management training and development should be systematically planned, properly organised. and appropriately evaluated in the Corporation. It was further recommended that top management and trainees should be truly committed to the management training and development system of the Corporation. Finally, it was recommended that the Federal Government should, considering the strategic role of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation in the management of the nation's economy, approve adequate financial resources for the training and development programmes of the Corporation.|Theses Collection|Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation/management training/development/level of commitment/Oil sector*||||||Obi, Olutayo Olumide|M|The effect of nutrition and health interventions in rural poultry production in Osun State||||||M.Sc.

The first was a survey to obtain information on profitability of rural chicken production in Osun state. Average flock size was 17 birds. Ninety-eight percent of the respondents offered grain supplements and average feed supplementation cost per bird per month was N 7.70. Basket coops were the common type of overnight housing provided and the depreciated cost was about N 0.103 per bird per month. The average price of a mature cock was N 79, while hens and growers cost N 58 and N 29, respectively. The farmers were willing to pay N 4.30 per bird for vaccination against Newcastle disease and N 6.70 per Kilogram of compounded feed. Gross margin estimation shows that the farmers realize a positive margin of N 4.50 from the sale of growers at 3 months of age and N9.00 and N 30.00 on hens and cocks, respectively, when sold at 6 months of age.The second study was conducted on-farm to study the effect of offering supplements (commercial growers mash) and vaccination against Newcastle disease on the productivity of scavenging village chickens. The treatments were villages in. which supplementation, vaccination, a combination of supplementation and vaccination were offered. The control was the village in which no experimental supplement or vaccination was offered to the scavenging birds. Data were collected on body weight changes, apparent average supplemental feed intake, flock size, number of eggs laid, number of chicks hatched, and number of chicks surviving at 2 , 4 , 6 and 8 weeks. The data collected was analyzed for means, standard deviations and percentages. The means were compared and separated using one-way analysis of variance and Duncans New multiple range test.The results indicate a drop in average apparent daily intake (g/bird) of the experimental supplements after the first period for the different groups except the cocks whose consumption fluctuated down the periods. The average daily weight gain (g/bird/day) fluctuated over time for birds in all treatments. The vaccination treatment had the highest average daily gain of 2.78 g/bird/day but this was not significantly different from other treatments. The average clutch sizes of hens in both supplementation and supplementation + vaccination treatments (9.26 and 8.78 eggs) were significantly higher than those in the vaccination and control treatments (6.70 and 6.33 eggs). The overall average clutch size was 8.36 eggs while the average number of chicks hatched was 6.08 a hatchability of 72.7%. Mortality was highest in the control treatment (65.0%).Supplementing 50% of the calculated requirements of scavenging chickens with commercial growers mash and timely vaccination against Newcastle disease improved the productivity and the gross margins obtainable from rural chicken production system.|These Collection|Feed supplementation/vaccination/nitrition/flock size/mortality/hatchability/rural chicken production*||||||Oladimeji, Hakeem Olawale|M|Bioactivity- guided fractionation of Acalypha  Wilkesiana||||||M.Sc.

Members of this genus are used extensively in traditional medicine in various cultures (African, Oriental, Indian, European and Oceanian) to treat a number of infections including skin fungal infections, respiratory disorders and gastrointestinal infections.In this work, six Acalypha species namely A.,ciliata, A. indica, A. hhispida and A,. wilkesiana varieties (Red, Golden-yellow and Lace varieties) were screened for antimicrobial properties and brine shrimp toxicity. Only A. ciliata, a weed, demonstrated LD50 200ppm in the brine shrimp assay. The ornamental plants, A. hispida and the three varieties of A. wilkesiana demonstrated significant antibacterial activities against E. coli, S. aurens, B. subtilis and Ps. aeruginosa. Only A. hispida and the red Acalypha showed significant anticandidal (C. pseudotropicalis) activity as well. Hence, one of these two, the red Acalypha was selected for detailed studies. The red Acalypha has been specifically reported to he used extensively in the treatment of bacterial and skin fungal infections like Pityriasis versicolor, Impetigo contagiosa and Tinea versicolor in traditional herbal medicine in Nigeria.Studies involving solvent-partitioning of the aqueous ethanolic extract located antimicrobial activity in the butanol fraction.Subsequent bioactivity directed this fraction successively on sephadex LH-20 and polyamide 6S column revealed the antibacterial principles as a mixture of two polyphenols. Minimum effort liquid chromatography of' the mixture on silica resolved the mixture into two compounds which were identified using spectroscopic methods, one as cofilagin and the other tentatively identified as geraniin. Both compounds isolated demonstrated antimicrobial activities against the five test organisms. While corilagin and geraniin have been previously reported from other sources, the antimicrobial properties of these ellagitannins have not been hitherto reported. Although corilagin is well known to be an artefact resulting from in-process hydrolysis of geraniin, the natural occurrence of this tannin in red Acalypha was confirmed, in the present study, by its thin-layer chromatographic detection in fresh leaves.|Theses collection.|Ornamental shrubs/gastrointestinal infections/antibacterial/skin fungal infections *
