The questionnaire was designated (CEQ) while the interview Guide was designated (SIG). The questionnaire was administered to two hundred and fifty academic and administrative staff members of Obafemi Awolowo University. Out of the two hundred and fifty subjects, one hundred and twenty-two submitted their completed questionnaires. In addition, twenty Committee members were selected for interview from the various Committees in the University. The responses of the subjects to the questionnaire and the interview guides were quantified and analysed using frequency counts and percentages.The major findings are that the Committees had not been too effective because the Committees were too many. Also membership of these Committees were not broadbased resulting in some of them being dormant. Furthermore, a consensus of opinions showed that the Committee-system of administration at Obafemi Awolowo University was fairly effective in decisionmaking and also an appropriate device for decentralization of higher educational administration|Theses Collection|Committee system/decision making/Obafemi Awolowo University/Higher educational administration/Nigeria*||||||Adedayo, Christianah Olubunmi|F|Studies on the Amylolytic enzymes associated with the black mould deterioration of Eko, a Nigerian fermented food||||||M.Sc Microbiology|P.O.

Eko is rich in carbohydrate and starch which is its principal storage carbohydrate is susceptible to degradation by amylolytic fungi. The growth of these fungi in eko leads to its spoilage and renders it unfit for human consumption. One of such organisms is  Aspergillus niger. Thus for A.niger to grow in eko, it must be able to produce enzymes capable of breaking down the starch constituent of eko.The objectives of this work are to determine the ability of A. niger to produce amylolytic enzymes during the deterioration of eko, and purification and characterization of the enzymes. Deterioration was initiated by inoculating eko slices with spores of A. niger and incubated at room temperature.  Within 11 days of	inoculation, eko Slices were covered by spores and mycelia of A. niger.  Extracts from infected eko were partially purified by a combination of gel filtratIon and ion-exchange chromatography.  The partially purified enzyme was separated by molecular exclusion chromatography into 2 components. Other parameters used in characterizing the enzymes include the effects of pH, temperature, monovalent and divalent cations and substrate -concentratien on amylase activity.The molecular weights were approximately 125,000 (peak F) and 70,000 (peak G). Components of peak F lacked amylase activity while those of peak G exhibited amylase activity. The optimum pH for the activity of the partially purified enzyme was 6.0 and optimum temperature was 35oC. Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ were stimulatory to the activity of the enzyme while EDTA and Hg2+ were inhibitors to amylase activity. The activity of the enzyme was greatly influenced by heat. Heating the enzyme at 70oC for 30 mins. led to complete loss of enzyme activity. The activity of the enzyme decreased as the concentration of starch increased. From the Lineweaver-Burk plot, the apparent Km for the hydrolysis of starch was approximately 0.4mg/ml.This study shows preponderance of amylolytic enzyme in deteriorated eko and that this enzyme was responsible for the spoilage of eko since it was broken down into simple sugars. The study also shows the conditions at which the enzyme is active and thus provide information which will help in designing  physiological control measures the storage of eko|Theses Collection|Eko/ fermented food/weaning food/fungi/maize/infants/Aspergilus niger/Amylolytic enzymes/Ile-Ife/Nigeria*||||||Akinloye, Oluseyi Adeboye |M|Structure and mechanism of action of â-Glucosidase from Haemolymph of the giant  African snail, Archachatina marginata||||||M.Sc.

This study of the catalytic parameters of the giant African snail Archachatina marginata â-glucosidase was undertaken in order to obtain some information about the kinetic properties, nature of ionizable groups at the active centre and their role in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme.The â-glucosidase was purified by gel filtration methods on Bio gel P-300 and Sephadex G-200 followed by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE Sephadex A-50 to apparent homogeneity. Two molecular forms or charged isomers were obtained. The apparent molecular weights were estimated on a calibrated Sephadex G-200 column to be 241, 667 ± 25,200 daltons and 193, 000± 10,250 daltons forI â-glucosidase I and â-glucosidase 11 respectively. The subunit molecular weight were found to be 98,000 daltons and 90,000 daltons for 3-glucosidase I and â-glucosidase II respectively. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constants, Km, of the crude haemolymph â-glucosidase, â-glucosidase I and â-glucosidase II for the substrate p-nitrophenyl â-D-glucopyranoside were 0.38mM, 0.10rnM and 0.03mM respectively.

Also, the most profitable levels of N for the production of open -pollinated and hybrid maize were determined.Two open-pollinated and two hybrid maize varieties were grown in the 1991 early and late seasons.  The field plot was laid out in a Randomized Complete Block Design [RCBD] with Split-plot arrangement. N was the main plot while varieties constituted the sub-plot.  Agronomic traits and yield components were measured and grain yields were calculated.  The prices of production resources (inputs) and the output were collected. Statistical analyses were carried out to determine if there were any significant differences in agronomic traits and grain yield among the N-fertilizer levels. The technical efficiencies (physical input-output relationships) in terms of maize output per hectare (ha) and maize output per kg of N-fertilizer used were computed.  Revenue, total production costs, returns-to-management and returns per Naira investment were computed and marginal analysis was used to determine the most profitable level of N. Open-pollinated maize varieties showed no significant difference among the levels of N for these agronomic traits: days-to-silking, stem lodging, plant stand at harvest, number of ears harvested, cob diameter and kernel depth while significant differences were observed among the N for all other traits namely, plant and ear heights, ear length, no of kernels per row and ear diameter.  Hybrids showed no significant difference among the levels of N for all the agronomic traits measured.  Generally, grain yield of hybrids increased from 2.29t at 0kgN/ha to 3.62t at 250kgN/ha, however, no significant difference was observed among the N levels.  Also no significant difference was observed in the grain yield of open-pollinated maize among the levels and the yield varied from 2.14t at 0 kgN/ha to 4.13t at 200kgN/ha.When the highest absolute profit is the farmer's main objective, open-pollinated maize is most profitable at 200kgN/ha and fertilizer rate should not be less than 50kgN/ha because productivity (yield-output per unit of fertilizer) could be further increased by increasing the level of input used.   At any input level above 200kgN/ha, the additional use of input resulted in a decrease in output and, therefore, a negative marginal physical product (MPP) was obtained.  Considering technical efficiency, when there is a limited supply of resources (capital) 50kgN/ha should be used while 200kgN/ha should be used if resources are abundant.In hybrid maize production, the most profitable level of N-fertilizer is 200kgN/ha.  The farmer should not produce at any level below 50kgN/ha because productivity could be further increased by increasing the input used.  However, the point at which the farmer should stop using additional input could not be obtained from this study because with the use of additional input, the output produced kept increasing, hence a negative MPP could not be obtained.  When resources are abundant, 200kgN/ha should be used while under limited supply of resources 50kgN/ha will be adequate.|Theses Collection|Nitrogen/Maize/Agronomic traits/Grain yield performance/Grain yield profitability/Ile-Ife/Nigeria*||||||Adejola, Abiodun Richards|M|Superpower involvement in the Arab-Israeli conflict||||||M.Sc|Dokun Oyesola||Ile-lfe, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, International Relations|1993|||OAU|||||xii, 143p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

One prominent feature of Middle East politics is the crucial role it played during the Cold War, and how the region was transformed into one of the most sensitive testing grounds of that War.  The work thus examines the effect of the emerging World Order, the demise of the Soviet Union, and how a renewed quest for peace in the region may affect the Arab-Israeli relations.The methodology adopted involved a review of existing literature covering official documents textbooks and other bulletins.  Interviews were also conducted with scholars and diplomats to shed more light on the intricacies surrounding the Arab-Israeli conflict.The findings reveal that the end of Superpower rivalry in the Middle East has robbed the principal regional actors of their most valued assets, that is, the ability to secure patronage by playing one Superpower against the other.  It also becomes noticeable that the emerging World Order dictates that the days of Superpower confrontation over a regional conflict were over. In the light of the above, the work then recommends a framework for future deliberations on the Arab-Israeli conflict.

It has often been asserted that the greatest single factor that has persistently inhibited the effectiveness of Local government administration in Nigeria is its inability to attract and retain adequate numbers of competent technical, professional or administrative staff. Thus the role that motivation can play in getting employees to give their best can hardly be over emphasised. This is based on the recognition that people are the pivot around which any organisation performance revolves.This study was conducted with the objectives of identifying the factors that can motivate local government employees and ascertain the relationship between the need satisfaction and perceived frustration among such employees. It is also aimed at identifying the categories of staff that are least satisfied with the work they perform. Based on the above, this study has attempted to answer the basic question of local government employees  motivation.   Is it the money or job fulfilment drive which motivates  local government employees? In  order to pursue this question,  some hypotheses were formulated to include the goals and  satisfactions of local government employees.  Thereafter, structured questionnaires were administered on a randomly sampled 304 staff from seven selected local governments of the defunct Bendel State.  The sample consisted of staff from the twenty-five regular cadres in the Unified Local Government Service.This study identified the main motivational factor of local government employees as money which enhances the expectancy theory approach and the instrumental satisfaction of money.  Thus intrinsic attachment to work is therefore relatively low. Although low, certain core characteristics of the job were however found to be favoured by the local government employees and are therefore critical to job satisfaction and performance. A significant relationship between need satisfaction and perceived frustration among the local government employees was also discovered.  Five cadres of local government employees which are least satisfied with the work they do were identified.  These cadres were: personnel officer, personnel/Accounting Assistants, Secretarial Assistants, Rural Development Workers and Ward Orderlies|Theses Collection|Motivation/Local government administration/Local government employees/Job satisfaction/Money/Bendel State/Nigeria*||||||Ogungbenro, Akanmu Ogunbunmi|M|An examination of self-serving bias in attribution for sports performance||||||Ph.D. Physical Education|J.

Apart from studying the prevalence of the disease, microbial organisms which may bepotential agents of the secondary infections characteristically known for complicating cases of the disease were investigated.For the microbiological aspects, swabs were taken of guinea worm ulcers, other exposed body parts of guinea worm patients (i.e. excluding the ulcer sites), similar body parts of non-guinea worm patients residing in the same guinea worm endemic areas and of non-guinea worm infected urban dwellers. The microorganisms which were recovered from these sources were identified. The bacterial isolates were tested for their susceptibility to fourteen different antibiotics while the effects of Savlon, Trichlorophenol (T. C. P.) and Izal on both the bacterial and fungal isolates were studied.Among the L. G. A. s, prevalence of dracunculiasis varied between. 1.6% in Ife-Central and 6.7% in Atakumosa. The overall prevalence of the disease in the study area was 3,8%.Using the Student's t-test of comparison, it was found that the differences in infection rates between the males and females and between the two groups of children (1-20 yrs.) and adults (>20 yrs.) were not significant (P> 0.05), Approximately 91% of the guinea worm ulcers were located on the feet and legs while the rest were sited on the mammary gland, scrotum, abdomen, pubis and the thigh. Both bacterial and fungal organisms were isolated from each of the four sources of specimens.	The bacterial isolates from the ulcers were Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium xeroses, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, an Enterococcus sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli,  Pseudomonas stutzeri, an Acinetobacter sp. and Shigella dysentariae while the fungal isolates from the ulcers were Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, a Candida sp. A Mucor sp., a Nigrospora sp., a Penicillium sp. and Trichophyton mentagrophytes.  Bacterial isolates from guinea worm ulcers (13) were more in number than those reported by any of the previous researchers of the same aspect of this study while such previous studies were silent on the involvement of fungal organisms. B. subtilis and M. luteus were found peculiar to the ulcers. Nevertheless this is not to implicate these organisms as being solely responsible for the cellulitis which usually accompanies guinea worm induced lesion. Each of the bacterial isolates was susceptible to at least one antibiotic. While all the gram positive isolates were susceptible to erythromycin, most gram negative isolates were susceptible to streptomycin and tetracycline. A combination of erythromycin and either streptomycin or tetracycline is therefore recommended in cases of ulcerating dracunculiasis instead of penicillin G which is habitually used.Savlon was observed to be most effective in inhibiting the growth of the bacterial isolates and is recommended for cleansing guinea worm wounds in the endemic areas.

It also assessed the problems of increased final cost of construction. Two methods of data collection were employed. The first involved the use of multiple-choice questionnaires administered to practising firms of Quantity Surveyors, Architects and Engineers as well as Clients and Contractors. Secondly, tender reports were collected for 20 of the 50 selected projects so as to be able to ascertain the relative effectiveness of Quantity Surveyor's (tender) estimate as a cost control tool for appraising tenders.The data analysis was carried out using percentiles, averages and correlation analyses while statistical tests of hypotheses were employed for the quantifiable cost data. The results showed that the prominent preliminary estimating methods in use were superficial, elemental cost analysis and approximate quantities. The study also revealed that the preliminary estimates prepared by Quantity Surveyors were not significantly different from the contract sums, hence their effectiveness.It further revealed that the critical factors causing differences between contract sum and the final construction cost were price fluctuation, government policies, variations, political instability and contractual claims among others. For selective tendering, the Quantity Surveyor's (tender) estimate, the average of contractors' tender sums and the lowest tender were found to be effective tools for appraising tenders. However, the average of contractors' tender sums was found to be the best. These affirmed the effectiveness of the Quantity Surveyor's estimate at the design stage.	The study recommended the early appointment of Quantity Surveyors and improved co-operation among construction professionals. These were to improve the effectiveness of preliminary estimates and provide opportunities for using the right estimating technique at the appropriate time. It further suggested a reduction in inflation rate by government and minimize variation by giving sufficient time for designers in order to arrest the critical factors influencing the final construction cost.

One hundred and twenty-two participants of the programme were randomly selected across the State. Primary data collected with the aid of structured questionnaire were analysed using descriptive statistics, production function technique, budgetary analysis and Markov chain process. The ratio of the Marginal value productivity (MVP) to the Marginal factor cost (MFC) was used to determine the efficiency of resource-use.  The results revealed that labour (hired and family) and fertilizer were inefficiently utilised, while farm land, pesticides and planting materials were efficiently utilised in arable crop production.  While labour and medicants were over-utilised, feed was under-utilised in poultry production.  In both enterprises, resources were not optimally allocated.Budgetary analysis results showed that the participants' enterprises were profitable.  The returns to management were N 2804.54/farmer and N2157.34/hectare for the secondary school leavers, and N4836.10/farmer and N2198.23/hectare for the university graduates in arable crop enterprise.

Markov chain analysis results indicated a declining trend in the number of IFP that would be adopted by the arable crop farmers until 1998 and stabilising on an average of 5 IFP/farmer thereafter provided the factors and conditions currently affecting adoption remain unchanged.  A greater proportion (0.52) would adopt less than 51 FP at equilibrium.  Similarly, a declining trend was indicated for farm size until the year 2002 and stabilising on an average farm size of 1.3ha/farmer.  At equilibrium, about 53 percent of the farmers would cultivate very small farm size (between 0.1 and 1.0 ha) if the current conditions prevail.  Flock size among the poultry farmers indicated an upward trend until the year 2020 and stabilising on a mean flock size of 1791 birds/farmer thereafter.  Majority (99 percent) of the poultry farmers would keep over one thousand birds flock size at equilibrium. The participant turnover of the programme from inception (1987) to 1994 (Survey year) was high (0.82).  The poultry enterprise could generate employment for two additional regular labour, while the arable enterprise could not even generate employment for an additional regular labour beside the operator which was lower than the target of five set by the NDE. The participants were saddled with problems of inadequate finance, infrastructure, labour and land. The state directorate of NDE was confronted with problems of poor funding, logistic support and loan repayment|Theses Collection|Resource-use efficiency/budgetary analysis/Markov chain process/participants' enterprises*||||||Olaiya, Thomas Adeleke|M|Diet and sports performance of secondary school athletes in seleceted States of Nigeria||||||Ph.D Education|J.

The sample comprised 115, 105 and 110 athletes from Anambra, Bauchi and Oyo States of Nigeria respectively. A dietary questionnaire was used to collect relevant data for the study. The data collected were analysed using proportion and percentage scores.The findings of the study showed that the diets of the subjects were predominantly carbohydrate foods across the three states. Forty three percent of the athletes considered carbohydrates as the food type that best aided their sports performance. The rating was followed by protein, vitamins and minerals, and fats and oil in that order. It was revealed that given specific numbers of percentages, 67% of the athletes wanted to see protein foods increased in their meals. The athletes in the study took different multivitamin tablets most of the time before competitions because they believed it would increase their energy or strength for performance. The results further showed that 70% of the subjects (231 out of 330) believed that regular consumption of water with glucose or other beverages would improve their performance. In general, the pattern of diet of the athletes in the study stemmed from the unfavourable financial position of their parents, loss of appetite and 'fasting'.Results from the data showed that the States where the athletes reside did not make substantial difference in the perception of the athletes about the type of food that best aided their performance. In addition it was found that geographical locations (in terms of the States of residence) do not make any appreciable difference in the dietary habits and practices of athletes in Secondary Schools in Nigeria|Theses Collection|Carbohydrate foods/multivitamin tablets/performance/practices of athletes  *||||||Adewolu, Adegbemile Oyewumi |F|Morphometric classification of 3rd order basins in parts of the Shasha river basin on the basement complex  rocks in south western Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The main objectives of the study are to determine whether drainage basins are significantly similar based on the underlying geology and lithology, and to identify the most significant morphometric parameters that can be used in characterizing similar drainage basins on the basement complex rocks.The stream network in the study area was mapped from 1:50,000 topographical sheets while information from 1:40,000 aerial photographs were used to supplement the topographical sheet. Map correction was done before the selection of fifty 3rd order basins using random sampling technique based on the table of random number. The ordering of the basins was carried out following Strahler's ordering scheme.Twenty one morphometric parameters were determined from each of the drainage basins. The data were normalized using logarithmic transformation after which they were subjected to principal component analysis. The five major components identified include number of first order stream (nl), Length of first order stream (L1), total stream length (EL)3, bifurcation ratio (Rb) and total number of streams (EN). The first two components i.e. number of first order streams (nl) and length of first order streams which account for about 50% of the variance and 63.7% of the strength of the five components were used for basin ordination.The study revealed that geology can significantly affect the grouping of similar basins in an area and that the specific morphometric parameters and length of first order stream can be used in ordination and grouping of similar drainage basins. The ANOVA test validates the hypothesis that there is no significant difference among drainage basins on each rock suite. The test equally revealed that pedological influence has no significant effect on the grouping of similar drainage basins and that other factors such as land use pattern, urban sprawl and vegetation type can affect the morphometric attributes of drainage basins in an area|Theses Collection|Local geology/ drainage basins/ aerial photographs/topographical sheet/ Strahler's ordering scheme*||||||Ojemba, Olufunmilola Comfort |F|Development of salad dressings from corn oil and soybean oil using egg-yolk and skim-milk powder as the emusifiers||||||M.Sc.

The use of other protein additives in emulsion formulations has been investigated. These protein substitutes are very expensive and their production is complex. Therefore, the use of skim milk powder as an emulsifier in salad dressings was investigated with a view to comparing it with egg yolk based dressings.Salad dressings were produced (with or without gum) from corn oil and Soya oil with the use of either egg yolk or skim milk as emulsifier. The products were evaluated for proximate composition ,rheological behaviour, emulsifying properties and microbial contamination. The dressings were subjected to sensory evaluation and variables such as texture, spreadability, taste, flavour, handfeel, smoothness and overall acceptability were assessed and the results were analysed statistically.The emulsification capacities of the emulsifiers were 50.0% and 57.14% for skim milk- and egg yolk- containing products, respectively. However addition of 0.2% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose increased the emulsification capacity to 86.21% and 89.89% respectively. Moisture, protein, fat, sugar, and starch of the samples were found in the range of 17.24 - 47.74%, 0.42 - 1.97%, 11.0 - 70.0%, 1.0 - 13.0% and 0.4 - 6.1% respectively. While corresponding values for Remia (commercial product as control) were 13.79%, 0.90%, 57.0%, 1.8% and 0.4%, respectively. The samples containing egg yolk as the emulsifier had higher viscosities (216.0 - 315.0 Nsm-2) than those containing skim milk powder (90.0 - 216.0 Nsm-2), although all the products were found to be pseudoplastic.The pH values of the fresh products decreased from the range of 4.09 - 5.14 to 3.89 -4.52 after six months storage while the free fatty acid values increased from 2.17 - 3.2 to 2.33 - 6.50. In addition, the peroxide value was determined after the six months storage in the range 32.56 - 59.67 meq/ kg. The sensory evaluation results showed that the panelists preferred egg yolk based dressings relative to skim milk based dressings for such quality attributes as smoothness, texture, spreadability and mouthfeel; although they preferred egg yolk based dressings, there was no significant difference at P<0.05 between skim milk based dressings and egg yolk based dressings in terms of saltiness, colour and flavour|Theses Collection|Sensory evaluation and variables/protein additives/emulsifying properties/microbial contamination*||||||Oladede, Adeniyi Bamidele|M|An evaluation of the performance of Community Bank in Osun State of Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The objectives of the study include determination of community bank market structure and policy variables influences on economic performance of community banking system; examination of socio-economic factors influencing community bank users; and an assessment of the effectiveness of the community banks in reaching the would-be users of the community banks.The data used for this study were derived from primary and secondary sources. The primary data were obtained with the aid of structured questionnaire administered on 120 community bank customers selected from 10 towns and villages in Osun State.  These are: Garage Olode, Modakeke, Gbongan, Ipetumodu, Okuku, Oyan, lragbiji, Ada, Inisha, and Ikirun. The respondents were chosen through random sampling technique.  The secondary data were obtained from National Board for Community Banks (NBCB). Analytical techniques employed include descriptive statistics and ordinary least square regression method. In the determination of economic performance of community banks in Osun State, the concentration ratio and loans to deposit ratio had negative influence on the community banks net profit to capital employed ratio and average yield rate, while number of community bank offices and time and savings deposit to total deposit ratio had positive influence on the community banks net profit to capital employed ratio and average yield rate and they are all statistically significant at 5% level.  This implies that net Profit to capital employed ratio and average yield rate of community banks in Osun State are jointly determined by all the independent variables mentioned above. For the Loan to Asset Ratio of community banks in Osun, all the independent variables-concentration ratio, number of community banks offices, loans to deposit ratio, and time & savings deposit to total deposit ratio were the major determinants of loans to asset ratio of the Community Banks in Osun State.The empirical results of economic performance of community banks in Osun State showed that community banks in Osun state have performed well. For the net capital to capital employed ratio, it was revealed that 75% and 87% of the variations of net profit to capital employed ratio equations were explained by concentration ratio, number of community banks offices, Loans to deposit ratio, and time and savings deposits to total deposit ratio. For the average yield rate (i.e. net profit to total asset ratio) 62% and 67% of variations observed in average yield rate equations are explained by concentration ratio, number of community banks offices, loans to deposit ratio, and time and savings deposits to total deposit ratio.

TOS 15223 is an obligate annual plant having green coloured leaf blade and outer leaf sheath but no pigmented organs (apiculus, stigma, sterile lemma, auricle, collar, ligule, nodal ring, inner leaf sheath and awn).  It is an early maturing cultivar with a maturity age of 71 days. TOS PURPLE is moderately tall with strong culms and purple leaves. All the organs (apiculus, stigma, ligule, auricle, collar, nodal ring, sterile lemma and outer leaf sheath) are coloured but the inner leaf sheath is white. It is early maturing with a maturity age of 90 days. It is weakly perennial.	Inheritance studies show that purple leaf blade is conditioned by two loci in such a way that the inhibitor locus must be homozygous recessive for the purple leaf blade gene, P1 to be expressed (ii PL-). The collar colour is also under the inhibitor gene as for the leaf blade. The coloured state of the apiculus, awn, stigma and outer leaf sheath are conditioned by a single dominant gene. The situation is different for the auricle and ligule which are conditioned by recessive genes at their respective loci. The inner sheath colouration is under the control of two independent genes in complementary gene interaction. The Pl gene exhibited manifold pleiotropic effect en all the organs except the inner leaf sheath colour which it inhibits. The colour of the sterile lemma is due to the pleiotropic action of the P1 gene. The gene for apiculus colour (Pa) is a major one which acts as a basic gene for colour expression in the inner leaf sheath and the organs of the junctura complex- ligule and auricle - which can express colour only when the genes that condition colour in them are present in addition with the gene Pa for purple apiculus colour.  Gene Pa, in the homozygous recessive condition, is said to be epistatic to the colour genes for the auricle and ligule. Gene Pa also expresses manifold pleiotropic effect on the stigma, awn, nodal ring and outer leaf sheath. This is precisely why this gene is considered the most reliable marker gene in the entire genic system considered.The perennial habit described in TOS PURPLE is monogenic recessive in inheritance. The obligate annual habit in TOS 15223 is a dominant condition. The inheritance of awns does not fit any classical ratio. The expression of awns in TOS 15223 is largely environmentally induced. This work has elucidated the genetics of purple pigmentation in TOS PURPLE. The marker value of apiculus colour which exercises pleiotropic control on the colour of the outer sheath, stigma and nodal ring have been determined. The genetics of perennial habit in TOS 15223 has also been elucidated.

The general thrust of the study involves the identification and characterisation of land cover types at three different time intervals for which remotely sensed data were available. The objective of the study was to show the changes in land use in the 14.85 km2 using multi-date imageries. The combination of SPOT satellite imageries and aerial photographs was used to generate the required land use information.The satellite imageries were composed using MULTISCOPE software package on Micro-processor (Bull Micral 60). The imageries were then visually analysed using grids to limit range of land cover recognition.The land cover types selected include: farmlands, derived savanna/fallow, built-up area/beautification plant/small farms, secondary forest, gallery forest, lawn and aquatic vegetation/water bodies. The extent of each cover was estimated and changes evaluated. The Analysis of Variance was used to test whether the changes were significantThe results indicate that over the period of interest, land area used for farming increased from 21.54% in 1977, (i.e. 3200.39 hectares) to 24.91% in 1989, (i.e., some 3700.33 hectares). At the same time forested land declined from 20.19% of the total campus, this means 3000.01 hectares in 1977 to 11.84% in 1989 which represents 1758.56 hectares. etc.If forest is accepted as a major element influencing the quality of the environment, then one implication of the findings in this study is that the quality of the environment must suffering depreciation with the bulk of the forested land virtually gone, soil loss due to run-off must be in the increase, and the biodiversity which is typical of the tropical rainforest environment badly damaged.The general conclusion is that the land cover/land use is rapidly changing on the campus. There is genuinely a need to stem the tide of change in order to minimise the problems associated particularly with the expansion of farming activities|Theses Collection|Identification and characterisation of land cover types/SPOT satellite imageries/aerial photographs/ Analysis of Variance *||||||Yusuff, Kamorudeen Adebayo|M|The impact of food and beverage multinational companies on industrialisation in south-western Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

Empirical studies have shown that transfer of technology via multinational companies can accelerate industrialisation process. This study, therefore evaluated the impact of Food and Beverage Multinational Companies on Industrialisation in South-Western Nigeria.Five food and beverage multinational companies were sampled. The raw materials and industrial equipment used for their products were examined. List of their products, the geographical spread and involvement of skilled Nigerians in the management of the companies, capabilities of Nigerians in research design and industrial equipment manufacturing were investigated. Six research institutes/capital goods manufacturing companies were also purposively selected for the study. Questionnaire was used to collect data. The data were analysed by using quantitative techniques such as mean, standard deviation, Spearman Rank Order Correlation, t-test and Chi square.One hundred and twenty agricultural/industrial raw materials used by food and beverage multinational companies were identified in the study. Out of this number, only seventeen of them (14.2%) have local substitutes. Also, ninety-nine industrial equipment were declared by these companies. 74.7% of the equipment had local alternatives that required modifications, aesthectic finishing and modern techniques to measure up with the international standard. From the two-tailed t-test of difference between the means of local sourcing and dependence on imported raw materials and technology, the calculated t-value was 1.11 while the critical value was 2.074. The results of the responses suggested that the difference between importation and local sourcing of raw materials/local fabrication of machines and equipment was not statistically significant. Other pertinent factors must be considered to boost industrialisation level.Technological capabilities/business acumen and broad scientific knowledge had significant effect on industrial proliferation. The calculated t-value was 3.20 while the critical value was 2.064. Three out of five companies selected for the study had high industrial impact as their computed mean response was 2.52. Based on the above findings, it was recommended among other things, that transfer and adaptation of foreign technology should be encouraged so as to build up domestic industries whose products will substitute those manufactured by multinational companies|Theses Collection|Economic growth/raw materials and industrial equipment/quantitative techniques/ foreign technology*||||||Shobola, Adeola Ayodeji|M|Correlates of occupational stress among hospital workers in Obafemi Awolowo University

The objectives among others were to determine the appropriateness of investment valuation in Nigeria as proxies for market prices and to examine reasons that could be empirically adduced for variations.An adaptation of the structure-conduct performance technique was employed to achieve these objectives. Statistical tools employed were the range, interquartile range, mean deviation from market price and regression/correlation analysis.Based on these tests, it was found that valuation estimates were not a good proxy for market prices in Lagos. The two most prominent reasons identified for this are firstly that valuers do not have a standardized approach to the determination of valuation inputs, and secondly, there is the lack of a. property data base to guide practitioners.Following from this, the study recommended among other things, a regularly updated data base department in the Valuers institution and a review of guidelines of valuation in Nigeria to ensure a greater uniformity of approach|Theses Collection|Investment valuation/structure-conduct performance/valuation inputs/property data base *||||||Oluyemi, Emmanuel Ayodele|M|Elemental characterization and source apportionment of Air particulates in Lagos metropolis||||||Ph.D. Chemistry|O.I.

The receptor models (Factor Analysis, Cluster Analysis and Chemical Mass Balance) were applied to the observed elemental concentrations in order to obtain the type and number of contributing sources and their relative contribution to the receptor.Air particulate samples were collected on Whatman-41 cellulose acetate filter paper mounted on cascade impactor attached to the Sierra-Anderson high-volume air sampler. Samples were collected into two fractions (coarse and fine fractions). However, six-stage samplings were done to investigate the particle-size distribution at each site.All the samples were analyzed for eighteen elements viz: Mg, Al, Si, CI, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Br and Pb by wavelength dispersive X-ray Fluorescence spectrometry while Na was determined by Atomic absorption spectrometry method. Samples were collected at Ile-Ife as a control and were analyzed with Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence technique for all elements.The results show that the range of the total suspended particulate (TSP) for Ikea, Yaba and Ikoyi were 66-379µg/m, 44-288µg/m and 31-129µg/m respectively while the range of TSP for Ile-Ife was 27-128µg/m. The results revealed that only about 17% of the observed concentration for Ikeja and 15% of the observed concentration for Yaba lie above the Federal Environmental Protection's (FEPA) recommended ambient air quality standard of 250µg/m . None of the observed values at Ikoyi and Ile--Ife was above the FEPA limit.Investigation of the Enrichment Factors (EF) of the elements shows that Na, S, CI, V, Cr, Co, Zn, Br and Pb were grossly enriched from anthropogenic sources while Al. Si, Ca, Ti, K, Mn and Fe in air particulates were mostly crustal origin.Application of Factor Analysis (FA) and Cluster Analysis (CA) to the elemental concentration reveals four prominent sources within Lagos metropolis viz: soil marine, automotive traffic and refuse Incineration. Ife samples were understandably devoid of a marine source.Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) model was applied to the observed elemental concentration of the samples. The result reveals that the entrained soil was the highest contributor to the particulates at all sites, contributing as much as 50%  of the total observed concentrations. This was usually followed by marine source and vehicular emissions. Industrial contribution to Lagos air particulates was minimal, in most cases it was found to be below 10% of the total suspended ed particulates|Theses Collection|Receptor models/atomic absorption spectrometry method/chemical mass balance (CMB) model/anthropogenic sources *||||||Jayeola-Omoyeni, M.S|M|Evaluation of people's perception of adult education programmes in Ondo state, Nigeria||||||Ph.D Adult Education|J.A.

The study thus assessed the relationship that existed between adult education and the formal system of educating people who were desirous to learn.Four hypotheses were raised and tested for the study. A research instrument known as "Evaluation of People's Perception of Adult Education" (EPPAE) was designed to collect information from selected participants and non-participants of adult education programmes in some Local Government Council areas of Ondo State. Some vital information to the study were also collected through oral interview. The following statistical methods - t-test, chi-square and percentiles were used to analyse the data collected.The result revealed that 73.3% of the respondents perceived adult education as a "sub-standard" educational system and the participants as "second-rate" academic citizens, and that the selected adult education programmes could not provide academic excellence in the society. To this effect, many participants disassociated themselves from adult education programme as a means through which they acquired their qualifications.The result further revealed that people in the study area showed ignorance of the scope, significance and the position of adult education in the life of the adults in the various communities. The result also showed that 77.7%system as if it was the only medium of education which could solve socio-economic problems and through which academic excellence could be attained. However, it was discovered from the study that formal education was no  only more education, but a new kind of learning attraction which could complement the formal education system. The result further stressed the need for improvement of adult education programmes specially designed for the teeming populations of workers to enable them acquire the desired basic literacy and higher educational qualifications at any age without quitting one's economic activities in the communities|Theses Collection|Evaluation of People's Perception of Adult Education (EPPAE)/statistical methods/formal education system/ literacy and higher educational qualifications *||||||Campbell ,Omolara Ayotunde|F|Export promotion and diversification under structural adjustment conditions in Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

It tried to ascertain the export concentration hypothesis of the pre-SAP era as justification for the export diversification hypothesis of the Sap era. Adequate consideration was given to the number of commodities on the export list pre-SAP, their volume and contribution to foreign exchange earnings compared to the situation during the SAP period. Also due consideration was given to the banking and shipping services as foreign exchange earner in Nigeria during the SAP period.Secondary data were utilized for our analysis from sources published by the Central Bank of Nigeria, Nigerian Export-Import Bank, and the Nigerian's Business Exports Channel for World Trade Information. We made use of data on Export of' commodities by economic sectors (1970-1994) in terms of' value and volume, production of major export commodities in metric tonnes, loans under NEXIM'S Rediscounting and Refinancing facility (RRF) between 1991-1993, loans under NEXIMs Foreign Input Facility (FIF) between 1991-1993, and progress reports on the other Incentive scheme, put in place under SAP. The analytical technique used in this study is the descriptive method with tabular illustrations and bar graphs to buttress the points of arguments.                             Based on the scrutiny of the available data, we reached the conclusion that on the aggregate, the export promotion incentive schemes put in place under SAP recorded measure of success. Export volumes and earnings of agricultural products increased and some degree of diversification into other minor agricultural products such pineapples, fish and shrimps, cashew, spices, cotton and yarn, sheanuts. cowhorn, sesame seeds and wood products/furniture, has taken place. Also, some Measure of success was recorded in the manufacturing sector. However, we found out that, although the potential for mineral exploitation is tremendous in some regions in Nigeria, this opportunity has not been fully explored except for crude oil which has received more than enough attention. As regards the export of services, available data indicated that banking and shipping services earned the country foreign exchange during the SAP era|Theses Collection|Government policy/foreign exchange earnings/NEXIM'S Rediscounting and Refinancing facility (RRF)/mineral exploitation/banking and shipping services  *||||||Owoaje,Tolulope Olusola |M|Classification and analysis of Okechukwu Ndubuisi's choral works||||||M.A. Music|C.O.

It examined how Ndubuisi resolved and utilized both western and indigenous African music elements in his choral works.The field aspect of this research was done through interviews with Ndubuisi and other Secondary respondents. In addition, scores of his choral music were collected, collated and classified according to the sources of the thematic materials utilized. The analysis is presented on two levels. First, the descriptive (structural) analysis of selected representative works and second, the analytical discussion of stylistic elements of form, tonality/harmony, rhythm and texture.Research findings showed two broad areas of Ndubuisi's choral works namely, general choral works and operatic choral works. Further classification revealed four specific categories On the other hand, the analysis portrayed Ndubuisi as an art music composer who preponderantly utilized African music elements in his choral works to project Nigerian folk music heritage.This thesis concluded that Okechukwu Ndubuisi's most outstanding contribution to art music composition in Nigeria is his use of both polyrhythmic and melorhythmic devices.

Three sites, namely a half hectare farmland with cases of varying degrees of erosion severity, 20 m x 10 m plots incrementally scalped to depths of 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 cm to simulate different degrees of erosion, and a set of standard 25 m x 4 m runoff plots were used. The farmland was divided into 3 erosion severity classes. Maize was planted on the plots and the yield determined at harvest. Additionally, cowpea was planted on one of the runoff plots, while a plot was maintained under bare fallow. The soil loss from the three plots was compared. Soil samples from the fields were analysed for various physical and chemical properties.The variation in the soil properties and the maize yield on the farm plot were found to be spatially dependent. The direction and the intensity of this variation suggest the influence of erosion and other geomorphological processes. The soil organic matter, pH and exchangeable bases decreased with increased erosion severity, while the soil bulk density, %gravel and %clay contents increased with increased degree of erosion severity. The soil hue, decreased from a mean value of 7.5YR on the un-eroded plots to 5YR on the slightly to moderately eroded plots, and may serve as an early visual indicator of incipient erosion. Soil loss on the runoff plots which ranged from 0.5 t/ha per annum under maize to 7.5 t/ha per annum under bare fallow plots corresponds to annual loss of 0.04 to 0.5 mm of topsoil.Erosion resulted in loss of yield on the fields studied. The mean maize grain yield on the slightly eroded and the moderately eroded plots were 88% and 83% of the yield on the un-eroded plots. The maize yield on the farm plot however decreased towards the upper slope positions of the landscape, suggesting the observed yield differences under the different erosion severity classes to be influenced by the landscape position. When compared to the control plot, the yield reduced to 47%, 22%, 9% and 4% on the plots with topsoil removed to 5, 10, 15 and 20 cm depths respectively. The maize yield was found to be positively correlated to soil pH, % organic carbon, field capacity and soil exchangeable bases content, while it was negatively correlated to soil bulk density, exchangeable acidity and gravel content. Factor analysis identified 5 factors on the topsoil and 4 on the subsoil that explained most of the variations in grain yield. These include: CEC, exchangeable acidity, texture, organic carbon and %gravel content for the topsoil; and exchangeable bases, organic carbon, %clay and the % of sand + silt for subsoil. These factor components when regressed against maize yield explained about 60% and 75% of the variations in maize yield for the topsoil and subsoil respectively.Based on the results of the study, a computer based model was developed for the evaluation of the productivity of eroded soils. This model named 'The modified Productivity Index (MPI), computes a sufficiency factor which ranges from 0 to 1 for all the soil variables considered in each incremental 20 cm soil layer, to a maximum of 100 cm. That is:MPI =å	ri=1  (Ai * Bi * Ci * Di * Ei * Ki )F'   (1) where A, B, C, D and E represent the sufficiency of water holding capacity, pH,	bulk density, gravel and organic carbon respectively.

Specifically, the Treasury bill rate was barely significant while the deposit rate is significant and indicates a negative effect on the acquisition of Cash and bills receivable by insurance companies. Against our expectation, government regulation and inflationary expectation had little or no significant impact on investment decisions of insurance companies. Based on the strengths of explanatory variables, funds availability and interest rates are the most important determinants of life insurance companies investment decisions while interest rates and the need for forward commitment are the most important determinants of non-life companies investment decisions.

Bagasse, the fibrous material remaining after extraction of sugar from sugarcane is among the renewable and cheap (low-cost) sources of carbon and energy readily available in large quantity in this country. This work therefore employs bagasse as a substrate for the production of cellulase enzyme using Aspergillus flatus, a phytogenic, eukaryotic organism associated with internal mouldiness in cocoa beans.The optimal medium for the growth of the A. flavus and its cellulase production ability was obtained by varying the concentration of the cellulosic material - bagasse, organic nitrogen, inorganic nitrogen and surfactants using Graeco-Latin square design. The effects of pretreatment of bagasse on the cellulase enzyme production such as ball milling-a physical pretreatment method, caustic (NaOH) swelling, potassium hydroxide, sodium sulphite and combination of sodium sulphite and caustic soda (ratio1: 1) were evaluated. The effects of aeration and shear sensitivity (agitation) were observed on the cellulase enzyme production in the Microferm Twin Fermentor. The best method of preserving the cellulase enzyme produced was also investigated by storing at room temperature (30±2°C), keeping inside fridge (0°C) and freezing (-4°C). The cellulase activity was determined from the reducing sugar production data.Statistical analysis of the results shows that 30g of bagasse, 0.3g/l urea (organic nitrogen), 1.4g/l ammonium sulphate (inorganic nitrogen) and 0.2% tween 40 in addition to other chemicals formed the optimal medium for the enzyme production using A.flavus Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and descriptive statistics carried out on the results generated from the effect of aeration and agitation rates on A.flavus show that agitation rate of 200rpm with aeration rate 1.0vvm led to better production of cellulase enzyme when a filter paper activity 0.0061U/ml  was obtained. The findings also show that higher agitation rates have a negative effect on cellulase enzyme activity. The best method observed for preserving the cellulase enzyme was by freezing (storing at	-4 as it led to retention of 87% of initial activity. The results also show that A. flavus cellulase is effective and that caustic swelling is the best pretreatment method for cellulase enzyme production|Theses Collection|Hydrolysis of cellulose/Bagasse/Graeco-Latin square design/Microferm Twin Fermentor/aeration and agitation rates/eukaryotic organism*||||||Oyewole, Kehinde Oyegunola|F|Measures employed by nurses in preventing pressure sores among hospitalized non-ambulatory patients in selected hospitals in Osun state||||||M.Sc.

Three hospitals were purposively selected and Norton Scale (1962) was employed to select 60 non-ambulatory patients. Watson (1992) criteria for assessing patients skin was employed to observe patient's skin for development of pressure sore. An observational checklist of selected pressure sore preventing measures (care of pressure areas, bed making, changing patient's position and offering of bedpans/urinals) was applied to a convenient sample of sixty nurses to assess their skills in carrying out the procedures during all duty shifts and spanning over eight weeks. Data collected were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics.The findings revealed that while majority of the sampled nurses were proficient in care of pressure areas and bed making (83.3% and 71.7% respectively) they were not proficient in carrying out changing of patient's position (76.7%) and offering of bedpans/urinals (73.3%). The frequency of performing all the four procedures was however inadequate and this could have contributed to development of pressure sore in thirty four (56.6%) of the sixty patients studied. Age of the patients revealed no significant relationship with development of pressure sore with an F-value of 0.9590 (95% level). Similarly sex of patient had no significant relationship with development of pressure sore with an F-value of 0.8180 (81 % level). However, duration of hospitalization revealed a significantly positive relationship with pressure sore development with an F-value of 0.148 (15% level).

Most of the breeds and strains of rabbits currently being used were developed under controlled conditions in the temperate region and are not well adapted to the tropics. However, wide genetic variability in reproductive traits between these breeds have been reported under tropical conditions. Thus, this experiment evaluated fertility and reproductive performance of three breeds of rabbits and their reciprocal crosses in South-Western Nigeria, with a view to determine the best genotype for the environment.Data were collected during three consecutive years (1992 to 1995) on purebred and crossbred litters produced at the Rabbit Unit of the Teaching and Research Farm, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife.  Forty-four purebred does comprising of 22 New Zealand White (NZW), 15 Chinchilla (CHS) and 7 Californian (CAL) does and 4 bucks from each breed were used at the beginning of the experiment. A total of 552 litters representing 6 genetic groups (NZW, CAL, CHS, NZWxCAL, NZWxCHS and CHSxCAL) were compared for fertility and litter traits at kindling and at weaning. Traits evaluated include number of matings to conception (NMC), litter traits at birth and at weaning, kindling interval (KI), and annual productivity of weaners. Least-squares procedures were used to determine effects of genetic group, season of kindling and genetic group x season interactions on litter traits and doe productivity. Genetic parameters were estimated from component of variance of sib analysis. For all the traits evaluated, the crossbred groups were superior to the pure breeds (P<0.05), except NMC and KI, where the performance of NZW purebred group was not significantly different from that of CHSxCAL crossbred (P>0.05). Season of kindling significantly affected NMC and KI (P<0.05). Poorer performance was observed during the dry season for both traits, but the crossbred groups were less affected by environmental extremes than the other genetic groups. Heritability estimates were low in magnitude for all the traits studied except litter weaning weight among the crossbred groups, which had a moderate value. Repeatability estimates were of moderate magnitude and showed in general, higher values at kindling than at weaning. These values showed that selection of does for litter traits would be more efficient when done at kindling than at later ages. Genetic correlations between litter size traits and litter weaning traits were positive, medium-to-high in magnitude and significant or highly significant for all genetic groups. Heterosis was observed for a number of litter traits, providing evidence of the superiority of crossbred groups. Using litter size at weaning, kindling interval, post-weaning survival and mature slaughter weight as evaluation criteria, a productivity index was drawn up to appraise the performances of the genetic groups per annum. Among all the groups, the offspring of NZWxCAL and NZWxCHS matings were superior in performance (P<0.05)|Theses Collection|Genetic variability/environmental extremes/weaning/controlled conditions/number of matings to conception/fertility and reproductive performance *||||||Omobuwajo,T.O.|M|Modelling of screw press operation for the expression of oil from palmkernel||||||Ph.D. Agric.

Hitherto, design and improvements of oil expellers have been based on experimentation and intuition, a sort of trial-and error approach.  The need for a more rigorous theoretical analysis of the fundamental principles of screw pressing is now acknowledged, and is the basis of this work.Transport of the oilseed material was modelled as axi-symmetric flow of a semi-solid material in the annular space between two finite horizontal co-axial cylinders to obtain simplified versions of the equations of motion. The stream function T, was introduced as the main dependent variable in place of the pressure and velocity terms in the combined momentum equation for ease of solution by numerical computation. The finite difference form of the partial differential equation was linearized by the Newton-Raphson method to generate a tridiagonal matrix of Jacobean elements for the system of linear equations. The equations were solved by a combination of Thomas algorithm and Gauss-Seidel (Liebmann) iteration on an IBM 486 system to generate the radial and axial pressure gradients. The values of predicted axial pressure were recovered from the values of predicted axial pressure gradients by numerical integration using the trapezoidal rule. Approximate values of the predicted radial pressure at selected locations on the press barrel were obtained from values of the predicted axial pressure and validated experimentally.The mean relative percentage deviation modulus between the predicted and experimental values was 30.7% and 23.7% at the operational speeds of 65 rpm and 85 rpm respectively. The predicted radial pressure gradients were used to predict the oil mass flow rates out of the press in the radial direction based on Darcy's equation for fluid flow in the cylindrical polar coordinate system, The predicted oil mass flow rate at 65 rpm was 16% less than the experimentally determined flow rate, while at 85 rpm, the predicted flow rate was 15% less than the experimental value. The observed deviation between the predicted and experimental values indicated that the model equations need to be improved further. The foregoing notwithstanding, the predictive property of the theory enunciated in this work, provides an alternative feasible approach to obtaining information about the performance of a conceptual press as opposed to costly and time consuming empirical studies. It will therefore be of invaluable assistance to engineers working on screw press designs|Theses Collection|Oil expellers/Newton-Raphson method/tridiagonal matrix of Jacobean/Thomas algorithm and Gauss-Seidel (Liebmann)/Darcy's equation for fluid flow*||||||Oyeweso Siyan|M|The political thought of Mokwugo Okoye since 1950||||||Ph.D. History|Olaniyan Richard||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, History|1997|||OAU|||||vi,380p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The catchment is underlain by weathered materials derived from coarse- grained, granite- gneiss rock type of the old suite, pre- Cambrian origin. The study was concerned with determining, temporal variations in stream solute concentrations with discharge, and ascertaining the hydrological factors or processes responsible for the observed variations.Stream water samples collected in the form of a time-intensive sampling during six storm-runoff events were analysed in the laboratory for certain chemical derterminands [namely pH, specific conductance, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+ Fe2+, NH4++, NO3_-N, PO43--P]. Rainwater samples were also collected using a bulk rainfall collection during each storm-runoff event and analysed chemically for the same array of chemical derterminands.Chemographs, hyetographs and hydrographs were used with hysteretic loops to depict the patterns of stream solute concentration variation with discharge during storm-runoff events. The results identified four major types of patterns namely: Inverse stream solute concentration variation with discharge, Positive stream solute concentration variation with discharge, Abrupt stream solute concentration rise and fall before peak discharge, Random or mixed stream solute concentration variation with discharge.Catchment hydrological characteristics, rainfall intensity, biological nutrient cycling, and rock-mineral weathering processes were identified as causal factors for these response types. These were, in turn, explained through the dilution effect, flush-out or wash-out of accumulated solutes in soil debris layers, and timing of storm-runoff into the river during storm runoff-events.Supporting hydrological and chemical data also show a strong evidence of subsurface movement of water in the catchment during storm-runoff events. This  flush out or wash off of solute materials are believed to be more important in Agbogbo catchment whose underlying geology is considerably weathered.The operations of these hydrological and chemical processes in the catchment's geoecosystem were thus revealed and comprehended better through the observed solute concentration variation with discharge of the study river during storm-runoff events|Theses Collection|Granite- gneiss rock/temporal variations/hydrological factors/weathered materials/storm-runoff event/chemical derterminands*||||||Taiwo, Kehinde Adekunbi|F|A study of some of the factors affecting the processing and canning of cowpea||||||Ph.D. Agric.

Production of commercially sterile whole cowpea seeds in tomato sauce will provide a substitute to the ready-to-eat HBB. In addition to processing the mature (dry) cowpea, the possibility of canning cowpea at physiological maturity (PM) will save the time otherwise needed for drying on the field, and allow for a second planting. This work was, therefore, aimed at studying the factors affecting the processing and canning of two cowpea varieties, Ife-BPC and IITA-2246.A water bath was used to maintain the temperature of the soaking medium for 15 min. to 6h for the cowpea varieties. Cooking was at atmospheric pressure for a period of 30 - 120 min. and a precision penetrometer was used to measure bean hardness. Thermal properties of rehydrated ground cowpea were studied under varying conditions (30°C - 90°C, 11.0% - 40.0% w.b. moisture content). The line probe method and the method of mixtures were respectively used for thermal conductivity and specific heat. Bacillus stearothermophilus was used in obtaining D- and z-values, and other process parameters at 114.5°C and 120.6°C. Optimal processing conditions for producing cowpea in tomato sauce were identified by sensory evaluation.The results indicate that the amount of water absorbed by whole seeds was influenced by temperature, time and their interaction. The seeds approached water saturation within 1h of soaking at between 45-75°C whereas it took 4h at room temperature. Penetration depth of soaked seeds was dependent on variety, soaking temperature and seed coat, the highest value being at 60°C.  Significantly, soaking for 1h prior to cooking reduced bean hardness as well as cooking time by as much as 40-50% and 12-14% respectively for IITA-2246 and Ife-BPC varieties (P < 0.05). Specific heat of cowpea flour increased with temperature in the range 60-70°C or moisture in the range 28.6-33.3% (w.b.). The bulk density decreased with initial moisture increase (up to 23.1%) but later increased with further increase in moisture content. Whilst thermal conductivity increased with moisture content and bulk density, it was independent of temperature in the range studied. From the results, mathematical relationships between soaking and cooking variables were best described by linear or logarithmic models, while quadratic equations represented the variation of specific heat and bulk density. Processing at 120.6°C resulted in a lower D-value, higher sterilising value (F°) and higher safety ratio (a/b) than at 114.5°C. It was established that soaking Ife-BPC seeds in water at 45°C for 1h prior to canning and sterilising for 75 min. at 120.6°C will yield sterile unfragmented cowpea seeds in tomato sauce of acceptable quality. Cowpea seeds (Ife-BPC) canned at PM using this established procedure had high consumer acceptance. Economic analysis revealed that the two-can filling lines had the highest return on investment and lower production cost per unit over the other packaging lines considered, i.e., 3-can filling lines or the pouch packaging lines|Theses Collection|Imported Heinz Baked Beans (HBB)/thermal properties/Bacillus stearothermophilus/physiological maturity/two cowpea varieties, Ife-BPC and IITA-2246*||||||Omogbenigun, Ibiyemi Olukemi|F|Oxidation polymorphism of proguanil in a Nigerian population||||||M.Sc.

The major enzyme responsible for this metabolism has been identified as mephenytoin hydroxylase (CYP2C19) which is responsible for the genetic polymorphism observed in metabolism of mephenytoin and a number of other drugs.The CYP2C19 phenotype was investigated in a native Nigerian population using the 8hr urinary metabolic ratio of proguanil to cycloguanil, in 130 volunteers, after an oral dose of 200mg proguanil, to each volunteer, as a probe drug. A simple and sensitive reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatographic method was developed for the analysis of proguanil and its metabolites in urine. Good precision and accuracy of the method were demonstrated by the low coefficient of variation which was between 1.2 and 6.1% for both the within-run and day -to -day run of proguanil and its metabolites. The analytical recoveries were between 84.65-95.27%.This population study has confirmed extensive inter-subject variability in the urinary proguanil/cycloguanil ratio. The prevalence of poor metabolizers of proguanil was found to be 7.7% (10 out of 130) in the Nigerian population.The method is of practical value for phenotyping the population since a knowledge of a patient's phenotype for drug metabolism can be of vital importance in drug therapy|Theses Collection|Antimalarial agent/metabolism/mephenytoin hydroxylase (CYP2C19)/metabolites in urine/drug therapy*||||||Olapade,  Ayotunde Olabowale|M|Assessment of the efficiency of the conventional water treatment methods on the bacteriological status of a crude oil-polluted public water supply||||||M.Sc.

However potable water can be polluted with crude petroleum or petroleum products during transportation and these have to be removed before the water is supplied for public consumption.  Since oil floats in water, it is not known whether the polluting oil can be removed during flocculation or filtration in the conventional water treatment process.  The efficiency of the conventional water treatment methods in the removal of polluting crude oil in water was assessed in this study.  The purpose was to determine whether the conventional water treatment was adequate for oil polluted water as a source of drinking water for municipal supplies.Water samples were collected from the Obafemi Awolowo University reservoir and various concentrations of crude oil added in the laboratory to simulate pollution.  The physico-chemical properties of the oil-polluted water samples were determined by standard methods and compared to those of the raw unpolluted water samples.  The effects of the polluting oil on the population of coliform, petroleum degrading bacteria and total bacteria were also appraised using standard bacteriological methods.The physico-chemical properties were observed to be altered with increase in oil concentration. The dissolved oxygen values obtained ranged between 7.5 mg/L for the raw unpolluted water samples and 0.b mg/L for the sample with highest oil pollution.  The temperature values ranged between 27°0 and 3000 for the control and the sample with highest pollution respectively, while the pH values ranged between 7.1 for control and 5.8 for the sample with the highest oil pollution.  The coliform count was observed to decrease with increase in oil concentration, the MPN values ranged between 53/100 cm3 to 144/100 cm3.  The total bacterial count was observed to initially increase with a moderate increase in oil concentration but later reduced drastically as the concentration increased.  The highest and lowest counts obtained were 256 c.f.u./cm3 and 15 c.f.u./cm3 respectively.The oil polluted water samples were subjected to conventional water treatment methods viz aeration, coagulation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection.  It was observed that the conventional methods though efficiently disinfected the oil-polluted water samples, were unable to restore the standard physico-chemical properties of the water. Traces of the polluting oil were still observed to be contained in the treated water samples. The oil traces when extracted and estimated were observed to increase with increase in oil concentration, that is,0.049g, 0.11g and 0.18g were extracted from samples polluted with 0.5%(v/v), 1.0%(v/v) and 1.5%(v/v) of oil respectively.The gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of the water soluble oil fractions revealed that they of low carbon atoms. Five peaks were identified, and these are decane (C10), undecane (C11), tridecane (C13), pentadecane (C15) and hexadecane (C16) based on their relative retention times that tallied when compared with reference compounds.Four genera of bacteria were identified from both the raw and oil-polluted water samples.

The main cocoa quality attributes are the flavour and the residual acidity of nibs which are both the result of chemical changes caused by microorganisms.Since the main quality attributes (flavour, acidity) of fermented cocoa result from chemical changes due to the activities of microorganisms during fermentation, investigation was carried out to study the effect of pre-curing treatment and fermentation types in regards to the occurrence and succession of yeasts and acetic acid bacteria.The pre-curing treatments used (pod storage and bean spreading) were compared in heap, bag and tray fermentation and the types of microorganisms and their role at the different stages of fermentation were evaluated.The results obtained from the various experiments indicated that pod storage and bean spreading (avow ably influenced the course of fermentation based on the parameters (pH, temperature. acidity and pulp sugar conversion) measured. However, the best result was obtained when the combined effect of pod storage and bean spreading was used. The highest temperatures obtained during the course of fermentation of untreated, stored, spread and stored/spread beans were 44°C on the 4th (lay, 45.5°C on the 3rd day, 43.5°C on the 3rd day and 45.5°C on the 2nd day respectively. Following the same order, the percentage sugar conversion and the final acetic acid content of the nibs at the end of fermentation were correspondingly 50.5% and 0.021 mM/ml; 50.9% and 0.1 I mM/ml; 44% ;and 0.009 mM/ml and 42.3% and 0.007 mM/ml respectively. The frequency of occurrence and the types of yeasts showed positive correlation with fermentation pattern changes as well as the relatedness between the yeast genera indicated similar functions.The main yeast genera identified (based on computer aided analyses of physiological tests and current taxonomical acceptability) were Saccharomyces,` Torulasaspora, Candida, Dekkera, Debaryomyces, Pichia, Kloeckera, Lodderomyces, Schizosaccharomyces, Rhodotorula, Saccharomycodes, Octosporomyces, Zygoascus, Arxiozyma, Treme//a and Kkluyveromyces. The acetic acid bacteria identified are members of the genus Acetobacter and the closely related genus Gluconobacter.Apart from the yeasts mentioned above, the computer aided identification indicated the possible presence of other genera (Schwanniomyces, Saccharomycopsis, Leucosporidium, Clavispora, Zygosaccharomyces, Sporoholomyces and Hypopichia) represented by mostly one specie occurring with low probabilities.

This study was carried out in two locations, a sandy loam and a sandy clay loam soil. Information was obtained on the weed control effectiveness and phytotoxicity of the herbicides to soybean. At both locations, the herbicides evaluated were applied pre-emergence at two rates.Results of the study indicated that the efficacy of all the herbicides differed with respect to the soil type. Weed control at the sandy loam soil location was very good and better than what was observed at the sandy clay loam soil location irrespective of herbicide treatment and rate of application. At the sandy loam soil location, adequate weed control was achieved by all the herbicide treatments evaluated except imazaquin whose activity at 0.25 kg a.i/ha declined from 6 weeks after planting (WAP). However, at the sandy clay loam soil location, imazaquin at 0.25 kg a. i and 0.50 kg a. i/ha and imazaquin plus pendimethalin at 1.07 kg a.i/ha (lid not adequately control weeds; imazethapyr at 0. 1 kg a.i and 0.2 kg a.i/ha and its mixture with pendimethalin at 1.02 kg a.i and 1.75 kg a.i/ha controlled weeds adequately at the sandy clay loam soil location up till 6 WAP before a decline set in.The control of some identified noxious weeds varied with each of the herbicide treatments. Panicum maximum Jacq and Rottboellia cochinchinensis (Lour.) .Clayton showed some level of tolerance to imazaquin but were suppressed by imazethapyr, imazaquin plus pendimethalin and imazethapyr plus pendimethalin at the rates used. Phytotoxicity of the herbicides to soybean was more glaring at the sandy loam soil location than at the sandy clay loam soil location. Amongst the herbicides used in this study, imazaquin was the least injurious to soybean at the two rates evaluated irrespective of location. The injury caused by imazaquin plus pendimethalin irrespective of rate was more severe than any other herbicide treatments especially at the sandy loam soil location; the symptoms persisted up till 9 WAP. A mixture of imazethapyr and pendimethalin was also phytotoxic up till 9 WAP. The highest yield of soybean was obtained from hand weeded plots; the unweeded control plots gave the poorest yield.

As a way of solving these problems, this study was carried out to evaluate the effects of rain water when compared with pipe-borne water, as well as studies the effects of ascorbic acid (AA) supplementation, on poultry performance.One hundred and eighty pullets at 23 weeks of age were randomly divided into six treatments. Each treatment had 30 birds in three replicates of ten birds per replicate. They were assigned to three vitamin levels (0, 125 and 250 ppm) in either rain or pipe-borne water in a 3 * 2 factorial design. Data were collected for 12 weeks on ambient temperature and humidity, egg production, feed intake, water intake, body weight, mortality, and egg quality parameters such as egg weight, maximal length, maximal equatorial diameter, egg shape index, surface area and shell weight. Other parameters include percent shell, shell thickness, shell weight/surface area, albumen weight, percent albumen and albumen index. Also considered were haugh unit, yolk weight, percent yolk, yolk index, yolk colour, and albumen: yolk ratio. Feed/kilogram eggs and feed per dozen eggs were other parameters considered. Analysis of variance was carried out on the data.The mean temperature observed (April to July) ranged from 25 °C (July) to 28 °C (April). Humidity ranged from 76 % (April) to 84 % (July). Water analysis showed that pipe-borne water had more dissolved Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Iron and Zinc than rain water, and a slightly higher pH (7.0 vs. 6.6). Also higher in pipe-borne water than rain were chlorides, sulphates and the carbonates. Rain water had a higher content of nitrate than pipe-borne water. Birds on pipe-borne water with 125ppm and 250 ppm AA had higher egg weights than the control (P <0.05). For birds served rain water ascorbic acid led to an improved hen day egg production (P < 0.05) but not egg weight (P> 0.05). Overall, AA supplementation, led to a significant improvement in egg weight, egg production and egg mass (P< 0.05). Pipe-borne water supported a higher (P <0.05) egg weight (49.95g) than rain water (49.47g). However, the other parameters considered were not significantly affected by water source.(P>0.05). Birds on the same vitamin level, irrespective of water source, had similar levels of performance. The only exception was obtained in birds on pipe-borne water with 250 ppm AA which had higher egg weight (50.28g) than their counterparts on rain water (49.25g). Generally, higher performance was obtained under AA supplementation than the control. I Higher albumen index of 0.09 was obtained in eggs of birds on rain water than their counterparts on pipe-borne water which had albumen index of 0.08 (P <0.05).

One hundred and thirty two (132) farming households selected at random supplied the primary data while records of Lagos State Agricultural Development Project (ADP) provided the secondary data. The distribution of income, expenditure, investment and other socio-economic details were determined.Farming as a major occupation of the rural households was followed by trading and paid employment. About 81% of the respondents had contact with extension agents. Improved planting materials were the most widely adopted innovation and improved storage the least. About 70% of the respondents patronized the LSADP input supply centres. Personal and family savings were the most important sources of financing farm operations. The most important crops were cassava (Manihot spp), maize (Zeamays), vegetables and melon (Citrullus lanatus) (mostly in mixtures). Mean net income of the household were N15,221 in 1991, N18,355 in 1992, N23,592 in 1993 and averaged N19,056 over the three year period. Equivalent real values of these incomes were N4, 592 in 1991, N3,734 in 1992 and N3,141 in 1993 indicating declining purchasing power over the period. Chi-square analysis showed significant relationship between adoption of technologies and farmers income as well as value of improved farm inputs used. The most important factors which affected income were cash at the beginning of the season, value of improved inputs used, number of farm plots available for cultivation, actual hectarage cultivated and savings in the previous year. The significant variables of investment were net income, hectarage cultivated in each year, age of the household head, years of household education and savings. Markov chain analysis showed that if the present state of the farmers' environment is maintained, long run equilibrium level of income would be attained by the year 2016 but with intervention it could be attained earlier. None of the respondents would earn less than N15, 000 while more than 78% would earn more than N45, 000. Investment analysis also showed that long run equilibrium farm investment configuration would be attained by the year 2047. In that year, practically none of the respondents would invest less than N12, 500 while those that would invest more than N15, 000 were about 43%.

The study was carried out to develop ways of predicting seed infection in soybean. Ten soybean cultivars were grown in five locations in two agro-ecological zones in the 1994 and 1995 growing seasons.Seedborne pathogens were recovered from soybean seeds obtained from all the agro-ecologies. The occurrence of fungal pathogens in 1995 was higher than the occurrence in 1994 whereas the incidence of bacteria was higher in 1994 than in 1995. Soybean seed quality varied among cultivars and maturity groups and was closely associated with fungal infection. In general, the results indicate that the incidence of seedborne pathogens was dependent on the field conditions especially the weather conditions and the plant genotype.Cercospora kikuchii (T.Matsu and Tomoyasu) Gardner, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (lib.) de Bary, Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp. and Macrophomina phaseolina (Tass.)Goid. occurred in all the locations. Phomopsi.s spp and Penicillium spp. were isolated from the rain forest zone. Cercospora sojina Hara, C. kikuchii and Penicillium spp, were isolated in 1995 but not in 1994. Similarly, Curvularia lunata (Wakk.) Boedijn and Phomopsis spp were isolated from soybean seeds in 1994 but not in 1995. The occurrence of most of the fungi isolated were negatively correlated with seed germination in culture, Fusarium spp, S. sclerotiorum, M. phaseolina and Aspergillus spp. were found to significantly reduce seed germination in culture. The incidence of Fusarium spp. was positively correlated with the incidence of M. phaseolina, C. kikuchii and S. sclerotiorum.Seed infection was lowest in Ile-Ife in both years and had the highest mean percent seed germination in culture. Makurdi had the highest percent seed infection and the highest incidence of M. phaseolina, S. sclerotiorum and Fusarium spp. Although the percent seed germination in culture in the rain forest zone was not significantly different from that of the southern Guinea savanna zone, the mean percent seed infection in the rain forest zone was significantly lower than that of the southern Guinea savanna zone. There were differences in the extent of seed infection among the cultivars used in the study. The genotype and environment interaction effect affected the pathogens recovered from the cultivars.

The physiography of the area is gently undulating with occasional rock outcrop at the middle slope positions and ironpan at break of slope preceding flat valley bottom positions. The trees have been observed to show substantial variations in growth and this was previously attributed to effect of rainfall regime and soil properties at the young stage of growth. The objectives of this study were to characterize and classify the soil in a 30 year old teak plantation and to evaluate the effect of soil characteristics derived from basement complex rocks on teak growth, establishment, and teak plantation management in these intensely weathered soils of the humid tropics.Eleven pedons were established, described and sampled from selected toposequences. In field replicated plots (0.0025 ha) tree measurement was carried out and computed to obtain tree growth statistics. Soil samples from each pedon were analysed for physical and chemical properties. Pedons situated on the upper and middle slope positions are well drained while pedons located at the footslope and valley bottom positions are imperfectly drained and poorly drained respectively. The lower slope positions are characterized by ironpan soils.The total exchangeable bases, exchange acidity and ECEC values ranged between 0.43  5.40, 0.56- 3.12 and 1.4- 7.06 cmol(+1)kg-1 soil respectively. The base saturation, total nitrogen, organic carbon (OC) and free iron, Fe(d), ranged between 64-83%, 0.02-0.10%, 0.16-2.18% and 0.04-3.50% respectively while available phosphorus varied between 1.31-3.31 ppm.Soils with clayey texture (> 35%) support better teak growth (using diameter and timber volume as indicators) than soils with sandy texture (> 65%). Total height of teak showed positive correlation with % OC (r = 0.52, P = 0.01) exchangeable K ( r =0.49, P = 0.050, Exchangeable Mg ( r = 0.61. P < 0.01) while it showed negative correlation with pH (water) (r =-0.48, P < 0.05) and free iron, Fe, (r = -0.62, P < 0.01).Timber height and timber volume showed negative correlation with exchangeable aluminum and pH (water) while basal diameter and timber volume showed positive correlation with available phosphorus, total exchangeable bases, and with individual values of exchangeable potassium, magnesium, calcium and sodium. Teak growth varied with the soil types but only the timber height and volume ha -1 were statiscally significant (P < 0.05).Total height of teak was influenced by exchangeable K, Mg, pH and free iron while timber height and volume were influenced by soil texture, available P, total exchangeable bases, exchangeable Al and pH. The well drained soils of upper and middle slope positions supported tall and robust teak while thin tall trees occupied the footslope positions. The valley bottom position was characterized by tree failure, slow growth, dead and dying trees. Soils with gravel not exceeding 60%, loam or clay loam but with no hydromorphic mottles; pH range of 4.7 to 7.4 and free iron concentration (1- 7%) supported teak growth in the area of study. Soil depth of 60 to 90 cm above the ironpan was found to be good enough for teak establishment.|Theses Collection|Gambari Forest Reserve in Nigeria/Tectona grandis L.F/ironpan/pedons/toposequences/soil texture/exchangeable bases/exchange acidity/hydromorphic mottles/pH value*||||||Alade, Lawson Babafemi|M|A socio-musical discourse of Ogbele music ensemble in Iju, Ondo State||||||M.A. Music|A.

The effect of this mode of training on the cardiovascular system was also of interest. Obesity was first confirmed by skin fold fat measurements. Twenty two subjects (11 males and 11 females) were taken through 40 minutes of exercise which included 20 minutes of stair-stepping using modified Canadia aerobic fitness step-testing protocol with 10 minutes warm up and 10 minutes cool-off periods before and after STT 3 times per week for 12 weeks. Their anthropometric (height, weight, skin fold fat level, body density and body mass index) and cardiovascular (blood pressure, heart rate and pulse pressure) parameters were monitored and the mean values at the start, at 6 weeks and at 12 weeks into training were compared. The sex variations and differences between the experimental and control group (11 females and 6 males who were not trained) in the 3 time-frames were also compared.Body weight, body fatness, body mass index systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and pulse pressure all decreased significantly (P<0.01). However, diastolic blood pressure decreased/ significantly at P<0.05 confidence level while body density increased significantly (P <O.05) after 12 weeks of STT. Changes in the above parameters were more significant (P <0.05) in males.  Significant changes were noticed at a training duration of 8-12 weeks while most side effects (muscle soreness, joint injury/pain, menstrual dysfunction, abdominal pain, headache/dizziness) were experienced within the first 4 weeks of training. The amount of weight/subcutaneous fat loss were significantly (P<0.01) dependent on the degree of fat/body density at the start of training. Rise in post training systolic blood pressure and heart rate was significantly (P<0.05) affected by baseline body fat level at the start of training.It was concluded from this study that: mild to moderately obese patients without orhopaedic, neurologic, cardio-circulatory or respiratory dysfunctions will benefit from 8-12 weeks STT after physically preparing the patients for about 2-3 weeks to improve joint flexibility and cardiovascular/muscular endurance. Step-test-training is therefore recommended as a therapeutic strategy in the physical management of obesity.

It is extensively cultivated in many parts of the tropics. Infection by pathogens during post harvest activities has been a major cause of substantial global loss and a source of constraint to fruit production.Extensive deterioration of tomato fruits infected with Fusarium oxysporum occurred within ten days. Extracts from the infected fruits exhibited protease activity while uninfected fruits lacked protease activity.The protease enzyme was partially purified by a combination of gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. The effects of pH, temperature, substrate concentration, and certain chemicals, monovalent and divalent cations on the activity of the enzyme were studied.Fractionation by molecular exclusion and ion-exchange chromatography gave two peaks of absorption (280nm) designated F and G. Their respective molecular weight estimates were 112,000 and 63100. Only the components of peak F exhibited protease activity.The partially purified enzyme exhibited optimum activity at pH 6.0, 35°C and at 12mg/ml concentration of casein. The activity of the enzyme was stimulated by Na+, Ca++, K+, Mg++ but inhibited by ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid and mercuric chloride.  From the lineweaver Burk plot, the apparent Km for the hydrolysis of casein was approximately 4.3mg/ml.Fusariumoxysporumis an important soft rot pathogen of tomato fruits especially in the tropics.

However, the hydrolysis of this polysaccharide to assimilable sugar presents a major technological and economic problem. It can be achieved by acid or alkali treatment both of which, are expensive, cumbersome and can generate effluent that is costly to treat. By using genetically engineered S. cerevisiae (ADH2p-XYN2-ADH2t) that synthesizes and secretes xylanases, this will facilitate a cheaper direct, one-step bioconversion of surplus hemicellulose and wastes to single-cell protein (SCP) or chemicals.In this study, the growth of the microorganism was carried out in order to obtain the kinetic and bioenergetic parameters in optimal medium which are required for operational design of bioreactors. The optimal substrate concentration for the growth of the genetically engineered S. cerevisiae (ADH2p-XYN2-ADH2t) under batch culture was determined by varying the initial glucose concentration. Each fermentation lasted 22 hours. Samples were withdrawn every hour. The samples were centrifuged and the supernatants were used to determine the reducing sugar concentrations by Miller's DNS method while the residue was used to determine the biomass concentration by carrying out cell dry weight analysis. The growth kinetic parameters were determined by using biomass and reducing sugar concentrations. The energetic parameters were estimated by using the reparameterized Pirt's model.Results obtained showed that the optimal substrate concentration was 20g/L based on the average biomass yield. "Crabtree effect" was experienced in all fermentations carried out and this appears to increase as the substrate concentration increases.  This phenomenon was also found to repress the growth of the microorganism.  The maximum specific growth rate. [tn.,. and doubling time, td, in optimal medium were 0.251 hr-` and 3.98 hr respectively.

It analysed the patterns of Community Banks sectoral loans and advances in financing local industrial projects, the effects of such loans utilization on income, savings and employment generating capacity of local entrepreneurs.  Also, it investigated factors militating against community banks loans allocation and utilization in the study area.The data for the study were obtained from primary and secondary sources. The former were obtained from industrialists and credit officers in the study area comprising of nine local government areas.  Two types of questionnaires were administered - One on the industrialists and the other on the credit officers.  The latter were from the credit records of each community bank's records and Federal Government publications notably CBN Publications and National Board for Community Banks among others. Descriptive statistics, such as frequency tables and percentages were used to analyse the data.   Also student t-test was used to test for significant differences in the mean values of entrepreneurs income, savings and employment generating level before and after loan utilization.The result showed that on the average 80.4% of the industrialists utilized the bank loans for income generating purposes such as business initiation, business expansion, purchase of raw materials, machines etc. As a result, the community banks' credit had a positive impact on entrepreneurs income, with an average of 88.2% of the entrepreneurs recording a significant increase in their income. Also, employment generating level increased significantly on the average by 97% largely due to business expansion. Nevertheless, only an average of  21.5% of the entrepreneurs increased their savings.The study further reflected the disposition of community banks lending for business expansion 64.7% arther than initiation 15.7% with priority to the commerce sector which accounted for 51% of total loans and advances.  The major factors militating against loan allocation and  utilization were inadequate fund mobilisation by  banks and insufficiency of loans granted the industrialist respectively.

This work is expected to provide useful data for the organic inhibitors capable of protecting corrosion of agro-allied equipment and machinery which had not been possible with inorganic inhibitor because or their poisonous nature.The investigations are in two parts; one, 'the effect of some amino acid inhibitors on mild steel' and the other, the effect of cold-work and various inhibitors on the corrosion behaviour of this mild steel in cassava fluid' using weight-loss technique.  Amiostructural examination of the corroded specimens was undertaken to ascertain the effect of some inhibitors on corrosion of mild steel.The result obtained indicates that alanine was observed to be more efficient than leucine and methonine by providing corrosion inhibition at molar concentrations of 0.20M, 0.30M and 0.30M respectively. However, glutamic acid did not show a reliable inhibition.   Low inhibitor concentration was found to accelerate corrosion substantially in the presence of cyanide and citric ions.   Cold working increased adsorption of inhibitors. Smaller quantities of inhibitors were therefore needed to inhibit corrosion of cold-worked of mild steel than in unworked samples. The findings were interpreted in term of competitive adsorption between the inhibitor and aggressive ions on the base metallic parts at the initial stages of inhibition and on the film growth and stability of film at later stages of inhibition. From the results, it appears adsorption of some amino acid inhibitors occur readily on mild steel and hence film growth appears to play the dominant role during inhibition.

Unfortunately, pioneer investments in mushroom cultivation in Nigeria have largely failed. This study evaluated the technology and market potential for cultivated mushroom in South-Western Nigeria.Data were collected from consumers, farmers and researchers using questionnaire, interview and participatory techniques.   The various options and scales of operation of the project were appraised by engineering economy methods.The study identified the main reasons for failure of pioneer investors in mushroom cultivation as managerial incapability accounted for by defective operational logistics.  This is reflected in the choice of cultivated varieties, inadequate process technology, scales of operation and market approach.   The study also identified market potential for cultivated mushroom. Process technology was proposed for two edible tropical mushrooms (Volvariella volvacea and Pleurotus ostreatus).   Majority of the common people are not willing to offer more than N20/kg for fresh mushroom while the elite restaurants and hotels indicated N400.00/kg. The engineering economy studies revealed that the venture could only be profitable now with a selling price not less than N174 and N115.00/kg for Volvarrella volvacea and Pleurotus ostreatus respectively.The net present value (NPV) measure of merit was positive for the project producing 3750 kg and 5000 kg (75 and 100% capacity utilizations respectively) per annum.

The studies were undertaken for a period of 24 months to ascertain the seasonal changes in the testes and epididymis of adult males. Simultaneously, the females' ovaries were examined over the same period to ascertain the overall reproductive cycles in both species.The occurrence and behaviour of polyploidy meiotic chromosomes in diakinesis were studied in relation to the diploid cells from the testes of males of both species. Histological studies were also carried out on paraffin sections of the left testis and epididymis stained in Ehrlich's hematoxylin and counter stained in Eosin. The seminiferous and epididymal tubule diameters and epithelial heights were measured directly from the sections using a calibrated eyepiece graticule. Photomicrographs of representative cells and sections were made as appropriate.Females were examined for the presence of eggs, enlarged ovarian follicles and evidence of multiple clutches. The snout-vent lengths, testes weights, incidence of diploid and polyploid cells in diakinesis, seminiferous and epididymal tubule diameters and epithelial heights were analysed using the T-tests, correlation and regression tests, analysis of variance and Duncan new multiple range tests as appropriate.Testes weights in both species showed no seasonality in their abundance, although in  the testes weights were generally low from August to January.The level of polyploid observed in the diakinesis stage in both Agama and Hemidactylus  was 29.1% and 17.0% respectively.  No multivalent associations were observed at any meiotic stage in both  species. There was also, no significant difference (P > 0.05) in the seasonal mode of' occurrence of the polyploid cells in the two species.Whereas the seminiferous tubule diameter and epithelia heights in the tow species showed no seasonal variations (P > 0.05), the epididymal tubule diameter and epithelial heights varied seasonally P>001). The snout-vent lengths in Hemidactylus correlated positively with the tetstes weigths    and seminiferopus tubule diameter, while such was absent in Agama. In both  species however, the testes weights correlated positively with the seminiferous tubule diameters. Females with eggs or enlarged ovarian follicles were caught throughout the study in both species. Females with multiple clutches were abundant inAgama - July. However, there was ,August to in female Agama, averaged 6 eggs ranging from 3-9  While in Hemidactylus it was normally 2 eggs. There was no correlation between the snout-vent lengths and clutch size in both species.The occurrence of polyploid spermatocytes which was established in both species appeared to be a device to produce more gametes for reproduction. Spermatogenesis and vitellogenesis in both species was also continuous but in-the diurnal Agama species cessation in reproductive activities occurred more prevalently from August to March. Similarl environmental factors appeared not to influence reproduction in hemidactylus, while reproduction in Agama seemed to depend on resource availability and the microclimatic, conditions at the sites of oviposition|Theses Collection|Polyploidy meiotic chromosomes/ Ehrlich's hematoxylin/Duncan new multiple range tests/reproductive cycles/testes weights/microclimatic/sites of oviposition*||||||Ibewuike, Joseph chukwuemeka|M|Bioactivity-guided isolation of the constituents of the leaves of Piliostigma Thonningii (Schum)||||||Ph.D. Pharmaceutical Chemistry|A.O.

In a screening of eighteen plant species from an inventory of Nigerian medicinal plants for anti-inflammatory activity, Piliostigma thonningii leaf extract was found to possess moderate but specific prostaglandin synthesis inhibitory activity.  The extract was also found to exhibit antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 6571, Escherichia coli NCTC 10418, Bacillus subtilis NCTC 8236 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145. This study is an attempt to relate specific constituents present in P. thonningii leaves with its widespread ethnomedicinal uses.The test for inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and the agar diffusion hole-in-plate method were therefore used as anti-inflammatory and antibacterial bioassays respectively to monitor the fractionation of the crude P. thonningii extract.  The fractionation was carried out using standard chromatographic techniques.A total of eleven compounds were isolated and their structures were unambiguously established by spectroscopic methods including infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopy, high resolution mass spectrometry and one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance experiments.  Five of the isolated compounds were novel, including the first ever C-methyl-2-phenoxychromone, Piliostigmin, 2-O-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-hydroxy-6-C-methyl-7-methoxychromone, the diterpene 16a-hydroxy-(-)-kauran-18-oic acid, and three C-methylflavonols: 6-C-methylquercetin 3,7-dimethyl ether, 6,8-di-C-methylquercetin 3,7-dimethyl ether and 6,8-di-C-methylquercetin 3-methyl ether. Four known C-methylflavonols were also isolated from P. thonningii for the first time, and were 6-C-methylquercetin 3,7,3'-trimethyl ether, 6-C-methylquercetin 3-methyl ether, 6,8-di-C-methylkaempferol 3-methyl ether and 6,8-di-C-methylkaempferol 3,7-dimethyl ether.All the isolated compounds were tested for ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and 6-C-methylquercetin 3,7,3'-trimethyl ether was found to be the most active (IC50 = 4.53 µM), being about 200 times as potent as aspirin.  It was also found that 6-C methylquercetin 3,7-dimethyl ether, 6-C-methylquercetin 3-methyl ether and 6,8-di-C-methylquercetin 3-methyl ether were more potent than aspirin as inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis.  The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC's) of the isolated compounds against Staphylococcus caucus NCTC 6571 were also determined. 6-C-Methylquercetin 3-methyl ether (MIC = 0.031 mM) was the most potent, while 6,8-di-C-methylquercetin 3-methyl ether (MIC = 0.125 mM), 6-C-methylquercetin 3,7-dimethyl ether (MIC = 1 mM) and 6,8-di-C-methylkaempferol 3-methyl ether (MIC = 0.125 mM) were also active.The observed antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of the isolated compounds were correlated with their structures, and the structural requirements for activity in both test systems were defined. Finally, the traditional use of P. thoruiingii in infections and inflammatory conditions was rationalized based on its content of the isolated compounds, and it has been proposed that the total crude extract, with its content of so many bioactive flavonoids, could be formulated for use in skin infections and inflammatory conditions|Theses Collection|Anti-inflammatory activity/prostaglandin synthesis/Staphylococcus aureus/Pseudomonas aeruginosa/Escherichia coli/bioactive flavonoids/skin infections/ *||||||Ibikunle, Abiodun Oluropo|M|The locational efficiency of petrol filling stations in Osogbo, Osun State of Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

Specifically the objectives of the study are to analyse the locational pattern of the petrol filling stations, and the demand and supply of petroleum products as well as identify the optimal locational pattern of petrol filling stations for the town.Nearest-neighbour and multiple regression analyses as well as tables and figures were used to analyse the various aspects of the distribution of petrol filling stations in 0sogbo. A location -Allocation model for determining optimal distributions of activities as well as an efficient system of flows of interaction between supply and demand points was used to evaluate the locational efficiency of the petrol filling stations in the study area.	The model, packaged into a Computer software called Location-Allocation Decision Support Systern (LADSS) developed by Paul Pen Sham (1990) was operationalized using data from  22 petrol filling stations and 509 patrons of the filling stations surveyed in Osogbo urban area.The results obtained from the analyses show that there is an increasing clustering of petrol stations in Osogbo urban area; seven petrol filling stations as against the existing twenty-two are enough to serve the Osogbo urban area completely; based on the seven petrol filling stations, every single individual will only be 170 metres away from a petrol filling station on the average and the maximum distance anyone will travel to patronize a petrol filling station in Osogbo will be 400 metres.The implication of the findings is that, for petrol filling stations in Osogbo to attract and maintain a sufficiently large and profitable volume of patronage, they must design good location strategies. The location strategy so designed has to allow for balance among such considerations as the firm's marketing programme, the geographical pattern of demand, consumer patronage behaviour, demographic characteristics of the area of operation and availability and desirability of individual sites.|Theses Collection|Petroleum products/optimal locational pattern/A location-Allocation model/allocation decision support systems/urban area/demographic characteristics*||||||Ibironke, Adewale Oluwafemi|M|Anti-implantation activity of  lagenaria breviflora saponing in rats.||||||M.Sc.

It is not known whether this group of bacteria can survive in the presence of chemical pollutant such as refined petroleum products which find their ways into bodies of water either by accident or during normal industrial operations resulting in chemical pollution. In this study, the ability of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis and Clostridium sp isolated from Opa stream to survive in the presence of polluting automobile liquid wastes was investigated. Various quantities of the polluting automobile liquid wastes in the range of 0.5% (v/v) to 1.5% (v/v) were used to simulate pollution in the laboratory for period of seven hours. The survival and growth rate were monitored by means of a spectrophotometer at 600 nm and viable count technique. The three bacterial indicators survival and growth decreased with increasing quantities of the polluting automobile liquid wastes. The optical density declined continuously from approximately 0.05 at zero hour to 0.00 by the sixth hour when the three bacteria were exposed to 1.5% (v/v) automobile liquid waste.  Whilst the automobile liquid wastes were 0.5% (v/v), the optical density and plate counts for Escherichia coli decreased from 0.05 to 0.01 and log10 6.6/cm3 (4.1 x 106) to log10 6.1/cm3 (1.5 x 106) respectively.  Plate counts for Clostridium sp and. Streptococcus faecalis decreased drastically from approximately log10 6.6/cm3 (4.1 x 106) until no growth was observed the sixth hour.  It was observed that the bacterial indicators response to the polluting automobile liquid wastes followed the same trend, however, Clostridium sp appeared to be more sensitive to the polluting automobile liquid wastes followed  by Streptococcus  faecalis and Escherichia coli in that order.  Gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of the polluting automobile liquid wastes revealed the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons with 14 - 15 carbon atoms and some other unidentified hydrocarbons.|Theses Collection|Escherichia coli/streptococcus faecalis/clostridium sp/faecal pollution/bacteria/chemical pollutant/refined petroleum product/polluting automobile liquid/petroleum hydrocarbons*||||||Isola, Oluwole Olukayode|M|The regulation of alpha-amylase production in Bacillus Stearothermophilus||||||M.Sc.

Mutation was chemically induced using 4.0% (w/v) ethylmethane-sulphonate (EMS).  De-repression of the alpha amylase gene (amyE) at various levels was achieved in these mutants resulting in differential rate of the enzyme biosynthesis. Four classes of mutants were identified.The first group, like the wild-type, was constitutive for alpha-amylase synthesis and strongly sensitive to glucose repression.  Group III mutants were characterized with constant alpha-amylase secretion irrespective of the media composition.  In the group IV mutants designated as "super-repressed" the alpha-amylase gene (amyE) appeared repressed under all conditions of growth.  Isolated catabolite repression insensitive (cri) mutants compared with the wild type exhibited altered growth and alpha-amylase secretion pattern, suggesting a relationship between this mutation and some other metabolic functions in the cell.The activities of the partially purified alpha-amylase isolated from the wild-type and two selected mutants were enhanced by Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and Na+.  The divalent cations were more potent than the monovalent cations.  Alpha-amylase isolated from the selected mutants had optimum activities at 40°C and 45°C compared with 55°C observed for that isolated from the wild-type.  The enzyme activity increased with an increase in substrate concentration until a maximum was achieved at 0.37mg/ml (am1), 0.60mg/ml (am2) and 0.90mg/ml (amW) for alpha-amylase from the mutants and the wild-type respectively.   The apparent Km value of the three partially purified alpha-amylase for starch was found to range between 0.29-0.35mg/ml.Alpha-amylase regulation in this organism is a function of media composition and its metabolic state|Theses Collection|Characterization of mutants/ethylmethane-sulphonate/enzyme biosynthesis/alpha amylase gene/glucose repression/catabolite repression insensitive/*||||||Sonibare, Ademola Jacob|M|Determination of the contribution of Warri refinary to its airshed volatile organic compounds (VOC) concentrations||||||M.Sc.

The ambient air concentrations of these compounds have been measured within the Warri refinery and its immediate and distant environs.Air samples were collected on activated charcoal and extracted with Carbon disulphide, CS2. The extracts were then subjected to Flame Ionization Detector (FID) analysis in a Gas Chromatograph using 1/8'' x 3 m stainless steel packed with 10% TCEP (1,2,3,-Tris 2-cyanoethoxy propane) on 80-100 mesh chromosorb column to determine the concentration of each of the compounds present. Emission modelling was performed on the refinery using its composite source activity descriptors and published emission factors as inputs.The highest measured ambient air concentration in the Warri refinery and its environs were: benzene - 1.39 mg/m3, toluene - 0.43 mg/m3, m-xylene - 0.12 mg/m3, and o-xylene - 0.51 mg/m3. These values were recorded between 1.0 and 2.0 km to the refinery The mean were: benzene - 0.36 mg/m3, toluene - 0.11 mg/m3, m-xylene.- 0.04 mg/m3 and o-xylene - 0.10 mg/m3. On the average, the observed concentrations did not exceed the tolerance ambient air concentration limits for Nigeria. The emission modelling exercise predicted the total estimated volatile organic compounds as 41350 ton/year with 9.63% and 90.37% coming from point and area sources respectively. Blowdown systems without control (with emission rate of 13230 ton/year) were the highest emission source and the least emission source was Catalyst handling in Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (with zero emission).  For FEPA limit of 0.83mg/m3 in respect of benzene not to be breached, the minimum percent control acceptable was calculated as 92.74%.  Based on multivariate Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) analysis, the predicted contributions from the refinery to the volatile organic compounds in its airshed were in the ranges: benzene (0.00- 11.22%) ; toluene (0.00- 16.33%); m-xylene (0.00- 11.58%) with the highest refinery contribution to all the compounds being recorded in the site within the refinery complex itself.

Sprengor (Rutaceae) is cultivated in various tropical and sub-tropical countries including Nigeria. The plant is used topically against eruptions and bites of poisonous animals, and taken orally as a stimulant, febrifuge and to cure dysentery. Numerous carbazole alkaloids, isolated from this plant, have been shown to possess anti-tumour and anti-microbial activities. Differences in the chemical constituents of co-generic species have been attributed to seasonal variation, geographical location and other factors. In the proposed biogenetic pathway to the carbazole alkaloids, many important intermediates are yet to be isolated from nature. Hence, the objective of this study was to attempt the isolation of these intermediates in order to provide evidence, if any, for the proposed biosynthetic pathway, as well as to isolate any other novel compounds of M. koenigii.The morphological parts of M. koenigii were extracted with CHC13 or CH2CI2 followed by MeOH. The extracts thus obtained were fractionated using column and preparative thin layer chromatographic systems. The fractions were further purified by repeated chromatography in several solvent systems. The resulting pure compounds were characterised by their melting points and spectroscopic characteristics (UV, IR, NMR and MS).A new furocoumarin, identified as 2",3"-epoxyindicolactone was isolated from the seeds of M. koenigii growing on a hillside of Marassana, Sri Lanka. Two other novel acyclic carbazole alkaloids named girinimbilol (2-hydroxy-3-methyl-l-(3'-methyl-2'-butenyl)-9H-carbazole) and mahanimbilol (2-hydroxy-3-methyl-l-(3',7'-dimethyl-2',6'-octadienyl)-9H-carbazole) were isolated and characterised from the stem bark of M. koenigii growing in the lowland Marassana and Nikaweratiya villages in Sri Lanka and from the stem of the same species growing in Benin Cityin Nigeria. Chemical cyclisation of mahanimbilol gave bicyclomahanimbiline with a novel bicyclocarbazole skeleton while girinimbilyl and mahanimbilyl acetates were prepared as new chemical products. Several linear furocoumarins, eleven known carbazole alkaloids and (3-sitosterol were also isolated and characterised.The distribution of the compounds in the seeds and stems of M. koenigii obtained from Sri Lanka and Nigeria confirmed the influence of geographical location on elaboration of the constituents of the plant, as earlier observed in two related species. The co-occurrence of girinimbilol and mahanimbilol together with girinimbine and mahanimbine corroborates an important link in the proposed biogenetic pathway of the 3C- carbazoles having the C18- and C23- skeletons|Theses Collection|Stimulant/anti-tumour/anti-microbial activities/biosynthetic/chromatographic systems/acyclic carbazole alkaloids/girinimbilol/girinimbilyl/mahanimbilyl acetates/bicyclomahanimbiline/bicyclocarbazole*||||||Agbara, Mark  Ameh|M|Factors Associated with fish consumption in Adamawa State of Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The specific objectives were to determine key factors which influence fish consumption and to project fish consumption for the period 1995-2010. It is envisaged that the study will provide useful information for effective planning of fish production and as well as provision of cheaper and easier means of increasing animal protein intake in the area.Primary and secondary data were used for the study. Collection of primary data was by using structured questionnaires in a cross-sectional survey between September and November, 1995. A sample of 200 fish consumers was randomly chosen to provide information on socio-economic characteristics such as age, marital status, income sources. expenditure pattern of households, frequency of consumption of fish and meat products ,etc. The secondary data used were those on population of the study area and that of income growth rate.Basic statistical techniques such as percentages, frequency distribution tables, means and modes were used to analyse the data collected from the field. This enabled the determination of socio-economic characteristics of respondents. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) multiple regression technique was employed to estimate the parameters in the fish consumption model. The linear, semilog, double-log and exponential forms of OLS were fitted to the data collected. Furthermore, fish consumption for Adamawa State for the period 1995-2010 was projected using two different equations.Results obtained in the study indicate that fishing is a major occupation in Adamawa State and about 65% 0f fish caught is sold. Fish is readily available to about 82 percent of consumers while meat is readily available to less than 3 percent. Only fresh and cured fish are consumed and the relative preference is in the ratio of 47.15 for fresh and cured fish. The specie of fish most preferred is Clarias gariepinus. The linear form of the OLS multiple regressions provided the best fit and it showed that household size and household income were significant at the 5 percent level in explaining the variation in fish consumption|Theses Collection|Fish production/increasing animal protein intake/information on socio-economic characteristics/of income growth rate/fishing is a major occupation/Clarias gariepinus  *||||||Adegoke, Tagudeen Jinadu|M|Thematic implications of the use of free direct speech and free indirect style in Elechi Amadi's The Concubine and The Great Ponds||||||M.A. English|C.O.

Fresh plant fruits were collected from riverine areas of Delta state in Nigeria. and cultured in saline water at Botany Department of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. Herbarium specimens from forestry herbarium, Ibadan (FHI), Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife (IFE) and University of Ibadan were used for the study. Transverse sections of the leaf blade and petiole as well as the radial longitudinal sections (RLS), tangential longitudinal sections (TLS), transverse sections (TS) of the young stem were made using Reicheit sliding microtome. Stomata frequency, stomata index and guard cell area were determined from the epidermal peels of the abaxial surface of the leaves.Anatomical features which can be used to define the genus are straight anticlinal walls of the cells of abaxial and adaxial epidermis, cyclocytic stomata occurring on the abaxial surface of the leaves, cladodromous venation, and vein endings usually two. Stomata frequency ranges between 12-27, stomata index ranges between 1.46-2.10 and guard cell area ranges between 235.62-957.21µm2 Leaf lamina and petiole outline are more or less boat shape and exhibit ring of bundles. Stem wood diffuse porous, vessel element paratracheal, circular to angular, rays non-storied, predominantly biseriate. Differences observed in the three species are slight and semi qualitative. R. mangle possess osteosclereids in the lamina.

The consistent subjective complaints of patients presenting with patellofemoral joint dysfunction include a gradual onset of pain, pain in the peri-patella region and pain aggravated by activities involving increased patellofemoral compressive stresses. The objective findings on physical examination may include patella alta, patella baja, and increased Q-angle. There is a dearth of information on the effect of Q-angle on the strength of quadriceps femoris muscle. This prospective study was conducted to (1) determine the effect of Q-angle on the quadriceps femoris muscle strength (2) compare the Q-angle measured in the supine and standing upright positions and (3) determine the relationship between Q-angle and physical characteristicsA total of 100 healthy Volunteers (50 males, 50 females) whose age ranged from 18 to 31 years were recruited for the study.  Subjects physical characteristics (age, weight, height, thigh length, thigh girth, body mass index) were measured. Q-angle was measured in both supine and standing upright positions. Subjects were classified into 4 groups. Groups A and B comprised of 25 males each with Q-angle of < 14° and > 14°, respectively. Groups C and D consisted of 25 females each with Q-angle of < 17° and > 17°, respectively. The quadriceps strength of the subjects were measured. Descriptive and inferential statistics were invoked to determine the relationship between quadriceps strength and Q-angle and other physical characteristicsThe results of the study showed that (1) there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) between the groups with low and high Q-angle values in both sexes, (2) Q-angle measured in the standing upright position was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that in the supine position; (3) significant correlations were obtained between  strength of all the physical characteristics measured.The results of this study demonstrated that quadriceps strength is independent of Q-angle and that it is necessary to standardise the position of the subject when measuring Q-angle.

Its main objective was to proffer theological interpretations of the New Testament hymns and to consider their socio-political New testament hymnsimplications for Africans at large. The thesis employed as its methodology a combination of	the historical-critical,Contextual-exegetical, musicological and the comparative approaches.The thesis found that the hymns are of Paramount significance to their contextual cultures as they contain their various belief-systems.	This makes the hymns adaptable to various aspects of contemporary Christian liturgies.	The thesis also found that both the New Testament and traditional Yoruba hymnodies are yet to be fully utilized.	On the basis of these findings, other ways by which the hymnodies could be effectively incorporated intoYoruba/African christian liturgies were recommended.The thesis concluded that the study of Hymnic texts will be useful in music and religious studies scholarships, as a way of laying foundation for future studies in biblical hymnology. Such a foundation will enhance the contextualization of New Testament music among African Christian churches in Yoruba land, and the study of African christian theology.

Evidently, the Universities have not been able to effectively carry out their responsibilities in recent times. Funds for material and equipment for teaching and research activities have not been adequate; administrative and overhead costs have eaten up substantial parts of their annual subventions. The annual growth rate of public investment expenditures is 18.75 per cent, while the GDP per cent respectivelyIn the light of the above, the nature and structure of public investment expenditures on the Universities are investigated in order to identify and appraise what the determinants of these investments might be using the period 1970 through 1996 as the review period.The OLSE technique is fitted to the data on Federal Universities. The public investment expenditure is regressed on the GDP, student enrolment, inflation and lagged public investment expenditures. The logarithmic function is used to allow for the estimation of elasticities for the relationship. The estimated relationship performs wellThe result reveals that the degree of responsiveness of the total public investment expenditures to changes in all the explanatory variables are inelastic. A one percent rise in lagged public investment expenditures, the GDP, the student enrolments and inflationary levels lead to a rise of only 0.56 , 0.81 , 0.33and 0.17 per cent respectively. This shows the severity of financial crises that rocked the universities as at the time of this study. Public investment expenditures on the Universities are less than optimal and as a result, the Universities cannot perform their roles effectively.  We therefore recommend that investment decisions on the universities be based on the identified variables in the model. Furthermore, the federal government should be responsible for the full cost of university education; and where this cannot be done, the students and or their parents should be prepared to some of these costs|Theses Collection|Administrative/overhead costs/public investment/student enrolment/inflation/lagged public investment expenditures/university education  *||||||Adetayo, Erlinda Dionco|F|Enterpreneural performance of micro-scale food processing industries in Osun State, Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Business Administration|P.E.

The study identified the socio-economic characteristics of the entrepreneurs, the industry profile and its profitability. The entrepreneurs' management practices were identified. The factors influencing the entrepreneurial performance were examined and their relationships were determined.Through systematic and purposive sampling techniques, 391 respondents in 12 villages of six selected local government areas of Osun State were sampled. A validated and pretested structured interview schedule was used in the collection of data administered by agricultural extension agents. For clarification of responses, unstructured interview and physical condition and linguistic observation techniques were used to support the interview schedule. Frequency distribution, percentages, mean, standard deviation and weighted average were used to describe the sample, while Pearson correlation, t-test, chi-square, analysis of variance and multiple regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses. Histogram was used to highlight the results.The results showed that 97 percent of the respondents were females and at their mean age of 42. They had average of 4 children and had an average of 6.5 years of formal education. Their business enterprises were not registered in any local, state or federal institutions. Sole proprietorship was the major form (94%) of business ownership. These were financed by personal savings (74%).  Gari (67%) was the major farm produce they processed using semi-mechanized (65 %) and traditional (31%) methods. The respondents relied mostly on own labour (52%) and their children (27%). The mean schedule of the industry production was 3.7 days in a week. The industry had a mean sales turnover of 88 percent. Almost all (96%) of the micro-entrepreneurs were not recording their business transactions and only 21 percent employed workers.The business profitability showed 48.14 percent before consumption of own product (COP) and 35.8 percent after COP. The benefit cost ratios were 2.83 before COP and 2.08 after COP.The results also showed that 7.36 percent of the variation in performance is explained by the independent variables contributing r2=0.04889 (management skills), r2=0.03632 (entrepreneurial traits), r2=0.00031 (motivation), r2=0.01186 (external business environment), r2=0.00001 (perceived obstacles) and r2=0.00217 (extension training). And when personality characteristics (r2=0.48483) and education (r2=0.00552) which were treated as moderators were viewed as dichotomies, they added significantly to the explained variation over and above that which is explained by the other six variables.In view of these results, it is concluded that there are many interacting factors which may influence micro scale entrepreneurial performance.

Group 1 of the 3 adult groups consisted of non -operative controls while groups 2 and 3 consisted of preoperative and postoperative samples of subjects respectively. In the paediatric category, the first group (Group 4) consisted of "preoperative samples which were the controls for the second group (Group 5) which consisted of the corresponding post operative samples of subjects. Each subject in each group was assessed in the key parameters of immune response stated above. These were then compared and statistically analysed within and between groups for correlations, significant differences and analysis of variance using the SAS statistical package for personal computers. They were also assessed for the influence of age.Absolute lymphocyte counts, and total leukocyte counts were carried out using standard methods .T-cell counts were carried out after lysis of erythrocytes and adsorption of B-cell, granulocyte and monocytes on nylon wool columns. B-cell counts were obtained indirectly as a difference between total lymphocyte counts and T-cell counts while lymphocyte cultures for percentage transformation tests were carried out in RPMI 1640 using the whole blood protocol of Pauly et al., (1971). The viability of lymphocytes after culture was done using the trypan blue dye exclusion procedure. Harvested cells were fixed in 3:1 methanol -acetic acid fixative and staining was in Giemsa, Leishmann and Wright's stains.Results showed that surgery decreased T-cell counts and decreased percentage lymphocyte viability. Percentage lymphocyte transformation decreased in the adult preoperative and postoperative groups when compared with non-operative controls. The results in the adult groups were similar to that in the Paediatric groups. The decline in immune performance also showed an age related pattern, indicating that age is an additional risk factor in surgery-induced immunodepresion .Surgical stress, therefore, exerts immunodepressive effects both pre-and post-operatively. Preoperative immunodepression is probably due to psychosocial stressors. These probably combine with the physical intraoperative stress of trauma to produce the marked immunodepression seen in the hours following the termination of surgery|Theses Collection|Lymphocyte viability and lymphocyte transformation in Nigerians/paediatric/preoperative/postoperative/SAS statistical package/Giemsa, Leishmann and Wright's stains/ immunodepression/psychosocial stressors*||||||Akande, Akinmade Timothy|M|The nominal group in the written English of senior secondary school II (SSS 2) pupils in Ede zone of Osun State, Nigeria||||||M.A. English|S.A.

The objectives of the research were addressed by examining the growth and structure of the country's educational industry and its impact on the supply of HLMP. The study also analysed the relative contribution of HLMP to economic growth in Nigeria. The empirical determination of the employment output elasticities of HLMP in Nigeria provided us with an insight into the quality of HLMP produced in the economyData were gathered from the publications of the Central Bank of Nigeria (Statistical Bulletin and Principal Economic Indicators), from where we obtained the data on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Gross Capital Formation.  Data on University and Polytechnic graduates (HLMP senior and intermediate), were obtained from the publications of the National Universities Commission and the National Board for Technical Education respectivelyThe research technique made use of econometric tools such as ordinary least-square technique and the econometric criteria with regard to a prior expected signs and magnitude of parameters. A multiple regression exercise was carried out where data on GDP were regressed on Capital and HLMP (Senior and Intermediate Category). Cobb-Douglas production function and the manpower requirement approach were used as the framework for the analysisThe results from the study indicated that there were imbalances in the structure of higher education in the country, notwithstanding the rapid expansion of higher education during the review period. The result also indicated some significant contribution of HLMP to GDP. However, the coefficients of HLMP were inelastic in relation to GDP. The revelation was that our educational system seems not to be producing the right calibre of graduates for our industries needed to stimulate economic growthIt was therefore recommended that the efficacy of the educational system be improved by adapting the content of education to priorities and strategies of national development.

Twenty seismic sections and a suite of geophysical well logs from three wells have been studied and interpreted with a view to delineating subsurface structures associated with hydrocarbon accumulation in the areaFour faults F1, F2, F3 and F4 were identified and four horizons were picked on the seismic sections at average depths of 1400m, 2400m, 3100m and 4100m respectively. These horizons divide the study area into five layers. The obtained seismic velocities for layers one to four are 1990m/s - 2070m/s, 2400m/s - 2700m/s, 2700m/s - 3400m/s and 2900m/s - 3300m/s respectively.

Merrill) at Ibadan (forest zone) and Ilorin (Savana zone) between 1992 and 1996. Soil analyses were carried out before and after planting to determine soil pH, organic matter content and N content.  In 1992, two cultivars of soybean (Samsoy-2 and TGX923-2E) were planted at four planting dates with three N-rates.  Planting was done at two-week intervals, starting from 7th July to 18th August in Ibadan and from 5th July to 16th August in Ilorin. The N-rates at both locations were OkgN/ha, 30kgN/ha and 60kgN/ha.  The experiments were repeated at the two locations in 1993. Pot experiments were conducted to determine the effect of time, source and N-rates on both Ibadan and Ilorin soils. Weather information was collected at both locations.  Variables measured were plant height, leaf area, plant dry matter, number of flowers/plant, number of pods/plants, number of seeds/pod, 100-seed weight, grain yield/plant and grain yield/ha      The Ibadan soil which belongs to Ibadan series (Typic Kandiudalf) contained higher organic matter and nitrogen than Ilorin soil which belongs to Gbemi series (Psamaquent Kandiustalf). Cultivar differences were obtained in both field and pot experiments.  Samsoy-2 matured earlier than TGX923-2E and produced bigger seeds. TGX923-2E produced larger leaf area, more flowers and pods per plant and more seeds per pod than samsoy-2. Plant height, pod number, 100-seed weight and grain yield per plant decreased with delayed planting. Yield and other agronomic characters varied from year to year and these were dependent on the prevailing weather conditions. Crops performed better in 1993 than 1992Nitrogen rates did not affect soybean grain yield/ha in Ibadan although vegetative development was enhanced. Soybean responded positively to N-application at 30kgN/ha in Ilorin. Total plant dry matter was highest with 30kgN/ha in the two locations. There was interaction effect of planting date and N-rates on grain yield. Nitrogen application was necessary for optimum grain yield when planting was delayed. Days-to-maturity decreased with delayed planting. High grain yields were obtained (4491.1 and 2198.0kg/ha in 1992 and 1993, respectively) when planting was delayed till the second week in August in Ibadan, but should not be delayed beyond the middle of July in IlorinNumber of nodules per plant decreased as N-application increased. Variables such as leaf area and number of nodules per plant were affected by time of N-application. Nitrogen applied at planting gave higher grain yeild at Ibadan while appliciation at Ilorin gave higher grain yield when made at the vegetative or flowering stage. Calcium ammonium nitrate and urea gave generally better results than ammonium sulphate. Leaf area, plant height, number of pods per plant and grain yield per plant also varied from location to location. Generally, plant height, number of pods and grain yield were significantly higher in Ibadan (P<0.05) than in Ilorin.  Thus, soybean should be planted earlier at Ilorin than Ibadan, but planting should not be delayed beyond early August in Ibadan. The organic matter content on the Ibadan soil will negate soybean response to nitrogen fertilization. Calcium ammonium nitrate or urea will be more acceptable as source of N for soybean because of the acidifying effect of ammonium sulphate on the soil|Theses Collection|Weather information/Gbemi series/cultivar differences/Nitrogen application/days-to-maturity/calcium ammonium nitrate/ammonium sulphate/Glycine max (L.)

Some derivatives of 2-naphthols especially short chain 6-alkyl-2-naphthols have been reported to have promising activities as an anti-microbial agent Some 6-alkyl-2-naphthols have been used as intermediates in the synthesis of azo-dye stuffs for synthetic fibres.  The named compounds have also been found useful in the development of multilayer films for solar cell productionIn the various reports on the synthesis of 6-alkyl-2-naphthols, Friedel-Crafts ablation of naphthalene ethers (for example 2-methoxynaphthalene) was the only procedure adopted. The non availability of the needed reagents coupled with a more drastic reaction conditions necessitated the consideration of Grignard reagent method for the synthesis of the desired products. In this work, 6-bromo-2-naphthol was first prepared and this was subsequently converted to the corresponding O-alkyl derivatives using various reagents (methyl iodide and benzyl chloride). The resulting 6-bromo-2-methoxynaphthalene or 6-bromo-2-benzyl-oxynaphthalene was obtained in very good yield The methyl ether and benzyl ether were successfully converted by means of Grignard reagent to the corresponding 6-alkyl-2-methoxynaphthalenes and 6-alkyl-2-benzyloxynaphthalenes In all cases investigated the yield was in the range of' 85-90%. The final products were made by demethylation or debenzylation of the methyl ether or benzyl ether of the corresponding 6-alkylnaphfahalene derivatives.

Beryl with a hexagonal crystal structure is another ring silicate with similar structure with tourmaline but of more importance to the jeweler. Tourmaline in its as an electronic component, i.e., transducers, a micro crack present in it is deleterious. Hence, the need to study the flow and fracture processes in the crystal relative to the crystallographic planes and directions. A similar study is carried out on beryl crystals. One thing that is very important to both materials is cutting. The directions of easy cutting and cleavage have to be identified, and the ease of crack propagation as measured by fracture toughness evaluated. Indentation techniques are established techniques for investigating micro hardness, anisotropy in such hardness, deformation mode and the controlling slip systems, and crack initiation and propagation (i.e., fracture) in brittle solids.The materials were identified and analysed using various x-ray techniques, and were found to contain some impurities as expected of natural crystals. Tourmaline was found to have a Si/Al ratio of 1.4 while the ratio is 3.4 for beryl. The orientations of the crystals were determined by obtaining and indexing the Laue x-ray back-reflection patterns of the crystals samples. Indentation techniques were used to investigate the nature of deformation and fracture in these ceramic materials, i.e., tourmaline single crystals and beryl single crystals. The Knoop indenter was used to study the anisotropy in the hardness of these materials. Fracture in them was treated by using Indentation Fracture Mechanics and adopting the median/radial crack system model. By using Knoop, Vickers and Berkovich indenters over certain load range of not more than IN some deformation and fracture parameters were obtained for the two materials. Experiments were performed on the (0001) and {1010} planes of the crystals of these materials. Analyses were done by using various microscopy methods viz. optical, electron, atomic force microscopy methods, and also computers.Both materials were found to exhibit hardness anisotropy in conformity with their rotary symmetry elements. Flow during indentation was found to be controlled by (0001)(1210)slip system on both the (0001) and (1010) planes of tourmaline crystal. In the case of beryl the operating slip system controlling flow on the (0001) plane was found to be (10T0)(1210) while on the (1010) plane it was (0001)(1210). The two materials show cleavage parallel to the basal plane (0001). Plastic yield stresses of ~G/7 and ~G/5 were obtained for tourmaline and beryl respectively. Also fracture toughness values of 0.5 MPa m1/2 and of 0.6 MPa m1/2 were obtained respectively|Theses Collection|Tourmaline crystals/piezoelectric/light polarizing properties/anisotropy/indenters/beryl/crystallographic*||||||Agboola, Femi Kayode|M|Purification and characterisation of alpha- glycerophospate dehydrogenase from the breast muscle of fruit bat   (Eidolon  helvum )||||||Ph.D. Biochemistry|Adeyinka Afolayan||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Biochemistry|1998|||OAU|||||xiii,169p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The study of the physicochemical and catalytic properties of a-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the pectoral muscle of the fruit bat, Eidolon helvum, was investigated in order to determine its physiological role and adaptation in meeting the energy requirement of the muscle for flight works.Cytoplasm Ü-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was purified to homogeneity by a combination of chromatographic procedures which involved ion-exchange on DEAE Sephacel and affinity chromatography with Reactive Blue 2-Agarose and Procion Red P-Sepharose 4B. The specific activity of the purified enzyme was approximately 120 units/mg of protein representing 850 purification fold and a yield of 13%. The apparent molecular weight of the native enzyme as determined by Sephadex G-100 chromatography was 59, 451 ± 1455 daltons and its subunits molecular weight was estimated to be 35,683 ± 415 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The true Michaelis-Menten constants for all substrates determined in 50mM Tris-HCI buffer (pH 7.5) were 3.624, 0.565, 0.18 and 0.0042 mM for Lglycerol-3-phosphate, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +), dihydroxyacetone phosphate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) respectively. The true Michaelis-Menten constants measured in 80mM glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 10.0) were found to be 2.74 and 0.417mM for L-glycerol-3-phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide respectively. Glycerol-3-phosphate was a non competitive inhibitor with respect to dihydroxyacetone phosphate which suggests the presence of an allosteric site for L-glycerol-3-phosphate. The amino acid composition showed that the enzyme had a relatively higher content of methionine and lysine and a lower content of glutamic-glutamine, glycine and valine than those of the corresponding enzymes isolated from rabbit, rat and chicken muscles. The inhibition of the enzyme by 5, 5 dithiobis-2-nitro benzoic acid (DTNB) showed the presence of two reactive thiol groups on the dimeric enzyme. The total number of sulphydryl groups estimated from its reaction with DTNB in the presence of denaturing agents was approximately 8 moles per mole of enzyme. The enzyme activity was not affected by creatine phosphate but inhibited to some extent by adenosine triphosphate (ATP).The overall results of the catalytic parameters suggest that a-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of the fruit bat catalyzes the unidirectional reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol-3-phosphate with a turnover number of 1.86 x 104s-1. This agrees well with the role of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the generation of glycerol-3-phosphate for phospholipid and triglyceride synthesis or maintenance of the cytosolic NAD+ level during anaerobic glycolysis, and production of reducing equivalents in the form of glycerol-3-phosphate for transport across the mitochondrial membrane as part of the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle.|Theses Collection|Alpha-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/glycolysis to phospholipid/Eidolon helvum,/chromatography/Michaelis-Menten constants/dihydroxyacetone phosphate/mitochondrial membrane  *||||||Afon, Abel Omoniyi|M|Perception of environmental quality of the core of Ogbomoso in Oyo State||||||M.Sc.

Included in the objectives of the study is to find out how the different social classes rate the satisfaction derived from various social services and amenities that are available for residents' use and how eventually such levels of satisfaction affected their overall environmental quality perceptionIn carrying out the study, primary data through questionnaire administration were collected. The respondents supplied information on their socio-economic characteristics as well as that of general environmental condition.The study identified as environmental quality indicators of the core area of Ogbomoso needs that are basic to the survival of residents. Among the ten most important environmental quality indicators are water availability, economic opportunities, good condition of roads, clean and healthy environment among others. It was also found that four of these ten most important variables are among the least satisfactory to core residents due to their inadequate availability.	It was further observed that there is a direct variation between environmental quality satisfaction and environmental quality perception. Perception held of environmental quality was however found to be different even under the same socio-economic and cultural background but with different residential location.The perception held of environmental quality of the core of Ogbomoso is a function of satisfaction derived from social amenities that are basic necessities to human healthy living The study therefore reveals that in order to improve the living condition of core residents, the provision of amenities like water, electricity, public toilet, health facilities among others by authorities concerned is of great importance.

The main objectives of the study were to find out; whether students who did well generally in the JSCE would also do well in the SSS in the state; whether there were particular subject areas in which the JSCE has pronounced predictive value; and also to find out whether the predictive validity of the JSCE in Osun State would be influenced by the school size, staff strength and staff qualifications.The population for the study consisted of 505 students made up of 315 (1993 JSCE) selected secondary schools in the state. Data collected were the 1993 JSCE results of those students and their promotional examination results in SS 1, SS2 and SSCE in related subjects.  The study made use of correlation analysis, t-test and chi-square (X2) statistics. Results of data analyses showed that there was no significant relationship between the performances of students in the JSCE and the SSCE. It was found that JSCE results in Mathematics showed the highest relationship (r = 0.38 p < .05) with SSS performance.  It was found that the school size, staff strength and staff-qualifications had no significant influence on the predictive validity of the JSCE.The results of this study suggested that JSCE in Osun state has a low capacity to predict the performances of students not only in SS I and SS2 promotional examinations but also in the SSCE. In other words, students who did well in the JSCE performed poorly in the SSS examinations.  There is therefore the need to evaluate the psychometric properties of the JSCE items or questions, the procedure administration of the examination, and the process of producing the final results.|Theses Collection|Staff qualifications/staff strength/staff-qualifications/psychometric properties*||||||Ajala Olayinka Akinsumbo|F|Regional impact of International Breweries Plc, Ilesa||||||M.Sc.

Most infections of this oral region are the result of the invasion by endogenous bacteria into the underlying tissues. These pathogenic bacteria are known to elaborate extra cellular enzymes and toxins that enhance their virulence.  The study was undertaken to determine the incidence of bacteria associated with orofacial infections, to categorize these infections based on clinical evaluation and also to evaluate antibiotic sensitivity patterns of the bacterial isolates.Thirty seven subjects from Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (O.A.U.T.H.C.)

Purulent specimens from patients were cultured on blood agar, eosin methylene blue (EMB) agar, mannitol salt agar (MSA), chocolate agar and phenyl ethyl alcohol (PEA) agar and Isolates were identified based on cultural, morphological and biochemical characteristics. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the bacteria were determined by disc diffusion method.Of the 81 isolates recovered, 60.0% were anaerobes, while 40.0% were facultative anaerobes.  The incidence of infection was highest (70.3%) among subjects below 41 years.  The prevalence of this infection was higher in males (62.1%) than females (37.9%). All the 71 isolates tested were, resistant to one or more antibiotics with 85.9% showing multiple antibiotic resistance.The study reveals that streptococci, fusobacteria, clostridia, peptostreptococci, lactobacilli and actinomycetes are the predominant organisms associated with orofacial infections in this environment|Theses Collection|Oral cavity/heterogeneous microbial habitats/endogenous bacteria/underlying tissues/pathogenic bacteria/antibiotic sensitivity patterns/eosin methylene blue/mannitol salt agar/phenyl ethyl alcohol agar/morphological/biochemical characteristics/streptococci/peptostreptococci/actinomycetes *||||||Adegoke, Moses Adekunle|M|N==1 supersymmetry with a tensor boson field||||||M.Sc.

In this thesis, N=1 supersymmetry model with a tensor boson is investigated in the same fashion that N=1 supersymmetry with a scalar boson is investigated. This is a slightly more general Wess-Zumino model comprising a triplet in which the scalar boson A(x) is replaced by a tensor boson Aìí(x). The triplet here is made up of the spinor particle, a pseudoscalar boson  and a tensor boson. The spinor particle is represented by the Majorana spinor ø, obeying ôø=0 and behaving under the guage transformation as äËø =0. The peuedoscalar boson is described by the field B obeying ÄÂ =0 and behaving under the guage transformation as äËÂ =0.

Proper exploitation of the solid minerals creates employment and generates income. It can lead to the provision of infrastructure such a road and electricity.  However it can also have negative impacts in form of degradation of the land, dusty environment and excessive noise.  The aim of this study is therefore to assess the socio-economic impact and environmental pollution at selected mining sites in Nigeria and to examine the measures being taken to address the problem.Questionnaires were used to collect data from twenty selected mines and quarries and from secondary sources such as information bulletins from the Federal Ministry of Solid Minerals Development. Information were gathered from observation of mining practice at some of the selected mines. Extent and intensity indices were used to analyse the data. Other quantitative measures such as percentages and weighted scores were used.The result of the study from respondents indicates that problems associated with mine pollution are dust (79.0%), noise (69.0%) and aesthectic nuisance (57.5%).  Forty five percent of the mines and quarries use water to suppress dust while seventy five percent use a wide range of delays to reduce noise. Sixty percent of the mines and quarries drill shorter blast holes to reduce ground vibration and also all the mining companies have future plan to purchase mine environmental monitoring devices.Continuous release of these mine pollutants into the environment, without monitoring and adequate control measures put in place; pose a serious health risk to the mine community. It is therefore recommended that the mining sites be effectively monitored by relevant agencies and that each mine or quarry in Nigeria must submit an environmental impact assessment of the mining site to the Ministry of Solid Minerals Development|Theses Collection|Solid mineral deposits/employment/pollution/provision of infrastructure/dusty environment/excessive noise/health risk/environmental impact assessment *||||||Adedoyin, Rufus Adesoji|M|The effect of histamine iontophoresis therapy on the heart rate and blood pressure of selected students of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife||||||M.Sc.

The disorders have been attributed to poor post-harvest handling and lack of appropriate storage techniques and facilities. Refrigeration which is widely used to preserve food commodities in Nigeria is injurious to plantain. Low doses of irradiation (0.05-0.5 kGy); mild hot water (400 - 60°C) dip for 5 minutes and film packaging with 25-40 um gauges of polyethylene bags have been found to control these disorders and hence delaying ripening and reducing post-harvest losses in some fruits. Therefore these methods were applied either as single or combined treatments to plantain (Musa AAB) in this study.The tests carried out to evaluate the efficacy of the methods applied included physical, biochemical, physiological and microbiological. These studies were carried out under actual (27-30°C and 70-85% RH) and simulated (27±2°C and 80±2% RH) tropical room condition: with sources of irradiation being cobalt-60 (60Co) gamma cell and van de Graaff Electrostatic Accelerator (Electron beams)Results showed that both the 60Co and electron beam radiation sources have similar ripening delaying effects on the plantain. The 0.1 key dose and 30 m film packaging were found to be the optimal irradiation and film packaging treatments for the fruit respectively. The 30 Am film delayed ripening by 2-17 days compared to the other gauges and the unpackaged control while the 0.1 kGy irradiation compared to the other doses and control, delayed ethylene evolution and yellow colour development in plantain by 1-2 days with attendant retarded starch conversion to sugar and slower chlorophyll degradation. There was also 20-40% reduction in pectin-methyl esterase activity. However, radiation activation of polyphenoloxidase, increased ascorbic acid depletion, skin browning and higher weight loss in the fruit occurred at radiation doses above 0.2 kGyThe combination of the 30 m polyethylene bag and 0.1 kGy elicited the most delayed ripening of up to 25 days. There was no significant delay in ripening of fruits treated with hot water immersion either as a single treatment or in combination with the other treatments; though a better control of fungal growth was observed when the 50°C, 5 rains. hot water immersion was combined with 0.1 kGy irradiation. Fungal growth (Aspergillus niger, Neurospora sitophila and Candida specie) on the fruit was not completely arrested by the different treatments and their combinations, except with 200 ppm benomyl fungicide solution pretreatment.The irradiation process which altered the rate of some biochemical and physiological processes associated with ripening achieved only minimal delay in ripening of plantain. Further delay in ripening and deterioration of the fruit is enhanced by combining irradiation with fungicide and the 30 µm film packaging treatments|Theses Collection|Food crops in Nigeria/pathological disorders/storage techniques and facilities/refrigeration/chlorophyll degradation/pectin-methyl esterase activity/polyphenoloxidase/fungal growth/film packaging treatments*||||||Ajibade, George Olusola|M|Esin ninu Ere-onise igbalode Yoruba||||||M.A. Yoruba|A.

The study further provided insights into the closely related concepts among the three religious groups that are mostly represented in Modern Yoruba Drama, such as: Belief in the Supreme Being, Satan, Destiny and Life after death. This is not to deny the fact that there are differences in the views of the modern Yoruba drama writers on such concepts.The studying also established that the socio-economic problems prevailing in the society have serious impact on the religious groups represented in the selected texts, which make many religious leaders to turn religion into commercial ventures.The study concluded that the writers of Modern Yoruba Drama books were not, biased in their presentation of religions in their books, rather their presentation is based on their experiences of the happenings in the society, especially the religious activity of the people in the society. They used their creative ability to present their works in order to differentiate it from mere history narration, and hence make the reading of such works easier.|vi,84p|||||||Yoruba||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

These authors are grouped into three: the early writers, the middle course writers and the latest writers. A general assessment of the importance of women and their limitations within the socio-cultural and religious set up of the Yoruba society was initially undertaken. The study also analysed the various techniques that were used to depict such feminine images in the works.The research method included oral interview of living authors and critics. Relevant materials were consulted in libraries. All these were undertaken in order to aid our understanding of the theory to be used and issues of women affairs in general. The selected authors' texts, both published and unpublished were then critically examined.The analysis was based mainly on the feminist approach to literature. While the study appreciated western feminist theory of literary criticism, the analysis was based principally on a reconstructed African feminist literary theory. Within this theory, the foremost objective of women is to regain the social and material grounds that are due to them and integrate these gains with contemporary struggles to elevate women within a non-sexist African concept of social cohesion. Also, the binary theory of complementarily postulated by Ilesanmi (1989) assisted us in analysing the texts properly. Each selected text was analysed in order to find out what images of women it depicted, the number of the images that were positive or negative and the sociocultural factors responsible for each set of images. A general assessment of the text within the context of contemporary womanist aspirations was made. Our findings showed that some ideas, namely, monogamy, polygamy, materialism, viciousness and beauty cut across all the groups in all the three Yoruba literary genres, viz, poetry, drama and the novel. Also, for each of these issues, women were always portrayedwanting in one way or the other. As for women beauty, each author acknowledges the natural beauty of women; but they equally make use of these various forms of beauty to the detriment of women.The study also noted that the images of women in many of the male authored Yoruba literary texts were a misrepresentation of the actual roles of women in Yoruba society. Secondly, the creation of these images was induced and sustained by the patriarchal power structure of Yoruba society. Thirdly, the presentation of these images was not meant for literature alone but also a manifestation of male chauvinism. The implication of all these is that there is need for more literary works in Yoruba portraying women positively to be undertaken. Moreso, there is need for Yoruba women also to come out with literary texts that could reveal what womens experiences are.|xv,175p|||||||Yoruba||Obafemi Awolowo University, H. O.

The general characteristics of HeroicHistorical Poetry across culture are considered and the  unique contributions of the Yoruba Heroic Historical Poetry are brought out.Relevant Literatures as well as archival materials were consulted to obtain the information needed for our research. Further investigations were conducted through the reading of books and journals on Heroic Historical Poetry in the Library.Also,  this research made use of systematic, lucid and comprehensive analysis of major stylistic devices of Heroic historical poetry syncronised with the theoretical foundations of narratology suited for our narrative poems. In addition, where we found this theory of Narratology insufficient for all the theoretical analysis of the work, we used literary and oral features suggested by Olatunji ( 1984).Research findings showed that, the presence of Heroic Historical Poetry in Yoruba culture is undisputable. Also, we were able to differentiate between Heroic Historical Poetic texts in Yoruba and group them into three broad categories which previous Yoruba scholars paid no attention to.The research looked into the stylistic features of Yoruba Heroic Historical Poetry and came up with the facts that each author of Yoruba Heroic Historical Poetry made use of literary figures that are best suitable to what they are writing on, in bringing out the beauty of their work.The thesis concluded that, all the features mentioned by Olatunji (1984) are suitable to written  Yoruba Heroic Historical Poetry and that all the feature are found to be of importance and useful in the analysis of Yoruba Heroic Historical Poetry.

Its study is therefore useful in the assessment of the rain water budget for any given area particularly with respect to the percentage that goes to augment soil and ground water storage. This is of general significance in water resources evaluation and management. The knowledge of infiltration rates is particularly important in irrigation schedulingFive major soil series were identified within the undeveloped part of the Obafemi Awolowo University Campus and four sites were selected on the rectilinear mid-slope on each of the soil series. Soil samples were taken at seven different depths (0-15cm; 15-30cm; 30-45cm; 45-60cm; 60-75cm; 75-90cm; and 90-1(15cm) on each site with a hand auger. Each of the soil samples collected was analysed using standard laboratory techniques. The properties measured include soil texture, bulk density and soil moisture content. Infiltration rates were measured on the field with infiltrometersThe main results show that the equilibrium rates of infiltration range between 10.2 to 23.5cm/hr-1 and 4.9 to 15.1 cm/hr-1  in dry and rainy seasons respectively for most of the soil series. The results also show that the rates not only vary among the soil series but also within each soil series. They also vary from season to season. For example, on Ibadan series the average rate was 15.lcm/hr-1 in the rainy season while it was 23.5cm/hr-1 in the dry season. Generally, soils with high percent of sand tend to have low moisture content, expectedly due to high infiltration rates, while soils with moderately clayey content tend to retain high greater volume of moisture. Soils with high content of sand such as Ibadan series are best able to support arable crops such as maize, groundnut, yam, etc. requiring minimum soil water retention. This is due to the fact that the rates of infiltration in such soils will be high and this will make it to dry up quickly during rainless days within the rainy season. On the other hand, clayey soils such as Itagunmodi and Araromi may support perennial crops because of their high moisture retention capacity which can enhance crop growth even during the dry season|Theses Collection|Hydrological cycle/water resources/ evaluation and management/soil moisture/infiltration rates/clayey soils such as Itagunmodi and Araromi/crop growth *||||||Mukoro, Akpomuvire|M|The role of the Delta State Local Government Service Commission in personnel management in the State's local governments||||||M.Sc.

This level of government with a considerable amount of financial, material and human resources has been witnessing stresses and strains in the pursuit of its constitutional responsibilities. These have largely prevented local government from performing their duties efficiently, effectively and responsibly especially with reference to service provision, socio-economic development and political empowerment of the citizens at the local level.The methodology employed for the study was historical, theoretical, descriptive and statistical. Primary data were sourced through the use of questionnaires, discussion with local government officials and participant observation. Secondary data were obtained from official documents and published and unpublished materials.The study established that the institution of the Local Government Service Commission has emasculated the potency of the individual local government councils in Delta State from performing the role of personnel management in all its ramifications. As such, the continuation of the arrangement whereby the local government service commission has the responsibility of managing senior personnel for the local governments, would continue to whittle down the self-confidence and viability of local governments.On the basis of the findings, the study recommended among others that the services of the local government service commission should be done away since with local governments in Delta State is quite capable of managing their personnel.|Theses Collection|Personnel management/human resources/local government service commission/material resources *||||||Mateawo, Adekoya Julius|M|The Economic Community of West African States and human resources development in West Africa||||||M.Sc.

It does this by critically analyzing its legal and institutional frameworks designed to promote their development. It reviewed the present state of human resources development in West Africa; examined the likely implication of these on general socio-economic development in the region; and suggested measures that ECOWAS might take to enhance the development of those resources.The findings revealed that, although human resources in the sub-region are in very poor state, ECOWAS, the sub-regional organisation established for the primary purpose of promoting rapid socio-economic development in the sub-region, has not been paying adequate attention to the development of the resources. This failure, the findings showed, resulted from lack of clearly defined policy objectives and plans coupled with inadequate funding arising from irregular and inadequate contribution by member states.In the light of these findings, the study suggested the establishment of a committee within the Executive Secretariat of ECOWAS to be responsible for the development of human resources in the sub-region. The terms of reference of the committee should include: carrying out a comprehensive study of the human resources situation and needs in the sub-region; planning for meeting such needs; implementing such plans; and controlling the deployment of available human resources in the sub-region. The study also advocated the setting up of a special fund for human resources development within the ECOWAS fund.

The objectives of the study were to obtain baseline levels of these elements and also to infer their bioavailability and toxicity to man and aquatic organisms. Sources of some of these trace elements in the drinking water supplies and the Lagos Lagoon were also identified using the receptor modelling technique - factor analysis.In the drinking and groundwater samples the mean levels of Al, Cr, Mo, Ba, Cu, Zn, Cd, Cs, Pb, Fe, Mn, Sb, Hg, Se, As, V and Ni ranged between 0.35ìg/l for Cs and 87.3ug/l for Zn in drinking water and between 0.54 ìg/l for Co and 420.3 pg/l for Ba in Groundwater. On the average, trace element concentrations in the drinking waters are low and satisfy WHO limits in most cases. However, percentage violations (<1%) of the WHO guidelines were observed for Cd, Cr, Hg, Al and Se in the drinking water samples.The levels of some trace elements in the Lagos Lagoon were relatively high compared to values obtainable in unpolluted surface water systems and Canadian Maximum Allowable Concentrations levels for surface waters used for fisheries. The wastewaters, particularly the industrial effluent, were highly enriched with some of the toxic trace elements and the levels of some of these elements were found to exceed FEPA guidelines. The trend of total concentrations for most of the elements studied in the waterwates was found to be in the order: Metal works >Auto-Battery > Paints > Textiles > Sewage Treatment plant > Central Wastewater Treatment plant.Source identification studies on trace elements in the drinking water supplies showed that elevated levels of elements like Hg, As and Se are probably from the source water itself (through chemical weathering and dumping of industrial effluent) while Cu, Cd and Zn are mainly from galvanised tanks used for storage purposes. In the Lagos Lagoon, the major source of heavy metals was found to be mainly industrial and domestic effluents which are discharged untreated into the Lagoon.Speciation analysis of selected heavy metals in the drinking waters showed that most of the metals in the drinking waters existed mainly in the inert form and therefore may not pose a serious threat to human health. The same observation was also made for the surface water samples in the Lagos Lagoon. Most of the toxic heavy metals investigated were found to be in the inert forms, but bioavailable forms (Chelex-labile fractions) of Cu and Zn were relatively high and this might pose a health hazard to aquatic organisms.In the wastewaters, the distribution of Cu, Fe, Mn, Cd, Pb and Zn between particulate and dissolved fractions of waste waters from two industries and a central industrial waste water treatment plant was also investigated. The range distribution of particulate and dissolved individual metal concentrations were <0.6pg/1-805 mg/l and <0.6ug/1-214 mg/l respectively. In most of the waste waters, Fe and Pb were found mainly (>55%) in the particulate fraction while Cu, Mn, and Zn concentrations were higher (>50%) in the dissolved fraction, which agrees well with previous studies carried out in tropical waters.This study has also revealed that apart from relatively high contributions from metal processing and auto-battery industries, domestic wastewaters are the biggest sources of trace metal input into the Lagos environment.The emission estimates reported in this study shows that domestic wastewaters contribute over 60% of the total trace metal emission budget from wastewaters.|Theses Collection|Plasma mass spectrometry/energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry/bioavailability/world health organisation/federal environmental protection agency/sewage treatment plant/central wastewater treatment plant*||||||Nwokeocha, Chinyere Constance|F|Botanical and cytogenetic studies in the genus Orysa linn||||||Ph.D. Botany|J.O.

Iongistaminata and 0. punctata) and to make collections. Agrobotanical studies, cytological studies, genetic studies, foliar epidermal studies and the pattern of distribution of protein in the rice grains were also carried out on the accessions of the above species collected.The germplasm survey revealed a somewhat clear zonation of the species--the occurrence of tetraploid O. punctata in the forest/derived savanna zone or agricultural mosaics of southwestern Nigeria, diploid O. punctata in the less permissive northern fringe of the savanna ecosystem, O. barthii in the Northern Guinea Savanna, and O. longistaminata in the fadamas and flood plains of the Middle Belt. The disease survey showed that the wild relatives of rice and the land races are generally resistant to blast caused by Pyricularia oryzae Cay. The local germplasms were found to be rich in variability for all the agrobotanical characters studied.The cytological studies of the parental accessions revealed normal meiosis with regular bivalent pairing as 12II in the diploid species (0. sativa, O. barthii, O. glaberrima and O. punctata) and 24II in tetraploid O. punctata. The interspecific crosses among 0. sativa, O. barthii and O. glaberrima are characterized by regular meiosis. The O. sativa X O. glaberrima hybrid is completely sterile but produced fertile hybrids on backcrossing: the cross between O. barthii and O. glaberrima produced fertile F1 plants while the cytological behaviour of the cross between O. barthii and O. sativa is characterized by largely regular bivalent pairing. In the crosses among O. sativa/0. glaberrima and tetraploid O. punctata meiosis is grossly irregular, marked by massive irregular segregation. The genetic studies elucidated the inheritance of characters such as dwarfness, panicle density, awning and ripened hull colouration, but the inheritance of tillering habit, plant type, maturity date and perennial habit were not conclusive. Dwarfness in AWGU DWARF-W is due to a reduction in the length of all internodes with most of the plant height being contributed by the elongated upper internode: dwarfness is conditioned by recessive genes at one locus. The data obtained in the F2 segregation for panicle density fits a 15 normal: 1 dense panicle ratio indicating that dense panicle is a digenic recessive character. The results from the study of awning revealed that the fully-awned state is dominant over the awnless state in the interspecific crosses but the order of dominance reversed in the intraspecific cross involving O. sativa. The genetic and morphological markers show simple Mendelian inheritance. The study on protein distribution pattern showed considerable variability within and among the species of Oryza.

The study adopted an interdisciplinary approach in its investigations of the factor of Ogutas geographical location vis-a-vis other Igbo communities in pre-colonial times.   It combined Archival studies with extensive field-work at Oguta and the neighbouring communities of Eastern Nigeria, in highlighting the mode of indigenous transportation systems which facilitated the growth of 0guta's economy in pre-colonial period.The thesis discovered that the advent of colonial rule shifted the balance of socio-economic developments in Eastern Nigeria in favour of towns such as Orlu, Owerri and Port-Harcourt.  The development of mechanical transport and the attendant net work of roads constructed by the Colonial authorities undermined Oguta's economy.  By the late 1950's the popularity of motor vehicles and bicycles, had the effect of pushing Oguta into the backwater of Eastern Nigerian economy.|Theses Collection|Transportation in the pre-colonial and colonial economies of Oguta/Ogutas geographical location/Archival studies/socio-economic developments in Eastern Nigeria//net work of roads/motor vehicles and bicycles/Eastern Nigerian economy*||||||Oderinwale, Florence Olufunmilayo|F|Assessment of urban solid waste management system in Ile-Ife township||||||M.Sc.

Emphasis was laid on solid waste generation, storage, collection and environmental implications of the disposal methods. Three main waste generating groups or units were identified for field study. These are residential, commercial or business and institutional areas. The study relied on data collected through questionnaire administration, survey of selected dump sites and interview with health officials in the study area. Two types of questionnaire were designed. The first types was administered to 800 households, 200 commercial or business centres and 50 institutions in area based on random sampling, The second type was for the sanitary health workers. A grab of wastes ready for disposal was taken from waste generators at each of ten randomly selected dump sites. Physical sorting of the refuse was carried out and different components were identified and classified into various types. Descriptive and inferential statistical techniques such as frequency counts, percentages, histograms, pie charts and one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA-1) were used to analyse the data. The results show that garbage and wrapping leaves were the dominant solid wastes while abattoir waste had lowest frequency. Although the types of solid wastes generated by the sampled groups were significantly different at both 0.05 and 0.01 levels, there was no significant difference in the disposal methods adopted by the sampled groups. Generally the mode of Storage and disposal of wastes was unhygienic and unsanitary. For instance, only 34% of the respondents disposed their wastes on a daily basis while about 56% dumped their wastes into streets or stream/near-by bush, about 23% resolved to open dump in the compounds; only 19% burn their solid wastes and less than 2% of the respondents dispose their wastes by burial. These methods of disposal have serious health implications on humans, water resources and ecological balance.The findings of this study suggest that solid waste management problem is more severe in medium size urban centres than big towns and cities in Nigeria..  It was found that majority of waste generators were ready to pay an amount ranging from N120.00 to about N300.00 per month for waste disposal. This implies that a shift from the policy thrust which regards waste disposal as a social service is likely to be accepted to the generality of the public in the study area.|Theses Collection|Identification of pattern of solid wastes/environmental implications/dominant solid wastes/health implications/ecological balance/solid waste management problem *||||||Odeseye, Omolara Rashidat|F|Optimazation of the starch degradation ability of a genetically engineered yeast (Sacchharomyces  cerevisiae  Z C89 )||||||M.Sc.

It is a non-toxic, relatively cheap, renewable resource which is universally acceptable for human and animal consumption and can easily be separated in purified form from raw-materials. Yeast ordinarily cannot degrade starch. However a genetically engineered yeast strain ZC89 has been cloned to produce extra cellular enzymes which can degrade starch. It is therefore necessary to optimize the starch degradation ability of this genetically engineered yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae ZC89) for biomass and ethanol production.The organism was grown on starch with varying initial concentrations separately under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Analysis of reducing sugar concentration, residual starch concentration, biomass concentration and amylolytic activity during aerobic and anaerobic conditions was carried out. Ethanol concentration was also determined using Gas Chromatography during anaerobic fermentation. Analysis of the data obtained from the fermentation studies was carried out using mathematical models based on the concept of specific rates.The results obtained showed that S. cerevisiae ZC89 was capable of hydrolyzing gelatinized starch and used the accumulated reducing sugar to produce biomass and ethanol. It was observed that the organism failed to hydrolyze the starch completely even on prolonged cultivation under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The growth rate in anaerobic processes was much lower than in aerobic processes. The biomass concentration and amylolytic activity increased with increased initial starch concentration. The optimal amylolytic activity was obtained at 24hrs for 8% starch concentration for aerobic process.The biomass produced and the measured amylolytic activity during aerobic processes was higher than those produced during anaerobic processes due to the production of ethanol during anaerobic processes. The highest ethanol concentration achieved was 18.63g/1 for 6% initial starch concentration. In the medium containing 4% starch concentration, a maximum ethanol concentration of 14.95g/l was obtained. The specific growth rates, specific substrate uptake and specific rate of product formation were examined, the highest values of true biomass energetic yield, ìmax, of 0.625 and 0.227 and correspondingly low values of maintenance coefficients, me, of 0.0113h-1 and 0.0638h-1 were obtained for 4% starch concentration for aerobic condition and 2% starch concentration for anaerobic condition respectively. The low maintenance values indicated that the organism was in no danger during starch degradation processes and therefore holds a lot of promise as a candidate for direct starch conversion and in the bioremediation of wastes associated with starch processing.|Theses Collection|Starch/yeast/enzymes/Saccharomyces cerevisiae ZC89/aerobic and anaerobic conditions/amylolytic activity/fermentation/gas chromatography/hydrolysis/biomass/ethanol concentration/bioremediation of wastes *||||||Obiyan, Aluegbebhotor Saturday|M|The federal character principle as an instrument of national integration in Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

It seeks to ascertain whether the principle has positive impact on national integration.  Furthermore, it examines how effective the operation of the principle in Nigeria has been in fostering national integration.The study also aims at ascertaining whether or not there is a marked difference in the perception of or attitude to, federal character principle by different ethnic groups in Nigeria. Finally, it seeks to find ways of making the principle achieve the objective of promoting national integration in the country.In order to achieve the purpose of this study several hypotheses were tested.  Relying on effective sample size of four hundred and sixty four, these hypotheses were subjected to scientific test.  The questionnaire method of data collection was used to elicit pertinent information from respondents.  Statistical percentages and descriptive methods were used to analyse the data.  From our analysis of the data, we found that federal character principle, in general, could contribute to the promotion of national integration.  However, the findings show that its ability to achieve this objective is contigent on appropriate articulation and implementation of the principle. The study shows that the manner in which the principle has been implemented in Nigeria has worked more in the direction of disintegration. We found out that the federal character principle will contribute to the promotion of national integration in Nigeria if it is carefully articulated and implemented in a way that does not undermine meritocratic principle.  The findings show that this can be achieved if, in cases where meritocratic criteria of evaluation can be explicitly determined, the principle is applied not as an equalisation mechanism but as a means of ensuring the representation of unrepresented or grossly underrepresented group(s) arising from the application of merit principle.We also found out that the areas where underrepresentation of groups mainly engenders disintegrative tendencies relate to top, visible administrative posts and political positions.  The reasons for this, as the study reveals, are because those areas constitute the glare of the public and are crucial to policy determination.  Thus, the emphasis of the application of the principle should be in such areas.The findings also show that the use of geographical/political unit, in contradistinction to ethnic category, is less disintegrative and clumsy.  However, the study reveals that representativeness will be better achieved if geographical spread is taken into cognizance in choosing people from multi-ethnic states.With respect to attitude of various ethnic groups in Nigeria to the principle, we found out that, in the main, there is no significant difference.  The few areas where there are differences of note relate to whether the manner of implementation of the principle so far in Nigeria has enhanced the development of a nationally integrated community and the appropriate index of representation.|Theses Collection|National integration/federal character principle/meritocratic principle/underrepresentation of groups/policy implementation/geographical/political unit*||||||Odelami Victoria Oluremi|F|Form and Ideology in selected tragedies of Ola Rotimi||||||M.A. Literature in English|B.M.

This thesis argued that our obligation to obey the law is a moral one considering the essence and practice of judicial review. When judges review a particular legislative law on the basis of a written constitution, what they are found to entrench is not only the provision of constitutional reasons for legislative failure of justice, but also, the moral criteria for the validity, authenticity and obligatoriness of laws.The thesis concluded that the doctrine of judicial review provides a sound theoretical basis for examining the obligatoriness of laws especially when such powers are exercised within a democratic frame work.|Theses Collection|Judicial review/Congress V Supreme Court/Supreme Law/Judicial Veto/moral obligation/legislative law/written constitution/democracy/Supreme Court*||||||Ojakorotu, Victor|M|Nigeria-South Africa relations since the end of apartheid, 1990-1997||||||M.Sc.

Nigeria came out of colonial bondage strongly against the apartheid regime in South Africa with many other independent African states following suit in the spirit of the O.A.U.  Nigeria -South Africa Relations was at best a no love lost situation during the apartheid years.The objective of the study is to elucidate the novel role Nigeria played towards the eradication of apartheid in South Africa and to explore the nature and dynamics of the Nigerian-South African nations in the post Apartheid era. This is with a view to making heuristic suggestions on the dimension that Nigeria - South Africa would likely take in the future.The approach in this study is analytical, descriptive and comparative using primary and secondary data which indicated that there is a major difference between Nigeria-South Africa relations before and after the end of apartheid.In the early 1990s, positive changes were unfolding in the apartheid enclave suggesting the imminent collapse of the obnoxious apartheid policy in South Africa. The eventual collapse of apartheid and the installation of a multiracial democracy in the country in 1994 this to large extent normalised the relations between Nigeria and South Africa for the first time.However, the re-emergence of South Africa in the international scene as an apartheid-free state is having some implications for Nigeria's leadership status in Africa. The economic prosperity of South Africa, the enthronement of multiracial democracy in the country, and the decisive roles it has started to play in international politics have all endeared it to the hearts of many nations of the world. A major fall-out from this development is the speculation that South Africa may take over the baton of continental leadership from Nigeria.To this end, there is a possibility of South Africa becoming a new regional hegemony in Africa and this possibility would appear to be re-defining the relations between it and Nigeria.

The study also examined the effects of nurses' years of experience, age and knowledge of pain and it's assessments on their methods of pain assessment.  It was a descriptive and exploratory design.One hundred and forty three nurses purposively selected participated in the study.  Also, forty-eight nurses, systematically selected from the list of nurses on duty roster were observed to corroborate the information given by the respondents.  A 26-item questionnaire was used to elicit responses from the respondents and an observational checklist was used to observe the nurses during the post-operative care of the patients within the first forty-eight hours alter surgery. Data collected were analysed using frequency counts, percentages and chi-square to determine any statistical significant differences in the responses of the subjects at 0.05 level of probability.The findings showed that 81.12% of the nurses reported that they assess their patient's post operative pain, but observation revealed that 70.83% of the nurses did not assess their patients for pain post-operatively.  The methods used in post-operative pain assessment by the nurses were; asking the patient to describe the quality (22.9%) and location (10.4%) of pain, and the use of physiologic indicators like blood pressure (2.1%) and pulse (2.1%).  The study also revealed that the choice of method(s) of post-operative pain assessment was not influenced by the nurses' years of experience (X2c==11.187, p<0.05).  However nurses' knowledge of pain and it's assessment as well as their ages influenced their choice of method(s) of pain assessment (X2c=17.53 and 2.5144 respectively at p<0.05).

The food industry in Nigeria is not an exception.  The focus of this study therefore, is to provide a framework for the sucessful development and management of new products in the food industry in South-western  Nigeria.The data for the study were collected from a sample of 10 food companies in South-Western Nigeria by use of questionnaires backed up with personal interviews, which were subjected to descriptive and Friedman non-parametric statistical and analyses.The results of the analyses showed a high rate (35.4%) of product failure.  The companys investment in R & D ranged between 0% and 2.5% of turnover, with about 40% of the firms investing less than 0.5%.  About 40% of the companies employed all the 7 phases of the new product development process.  Most of the companies (90%) develop new products through multidisciplinary teams of professionals.  The Friedman test showed the defense of market share position, maintenance of position as product innovator, establishing a foothold in a new market and the existence of a large potential market as the most important factors motivating new product development decisions. This indicated that new product decisions were market-driven.  Product superiority/uniqueness was also ranked as the most important contributor to new product success.  The implications of these findings are that food companies need to adequately fund R & D departments.  They also need to be more active in all phases of the product development process in view of the interrelatedness and interdependence in the activities involved.  For the companies to cope with the challenges of the industry, they should continue to monitor trends in the market for the purpose of developing new products to fill identified gaps.

Also, its ability to secrete extra cellular enzymes directly into the medium has made Bacillus subtilis one of the most studied systems with respect to the expression of heterologous genes.The objectives of this work were to induce and isolate mutants of Bacillus subtilis affected in the synthesis of endoglucanase enzyme, to isolate mutants which are catabolite repression insensitive (CRI mutants) and to characterize the endoglucanase enzyme derived from the wild type and selected mutants of Bacillus subtilis in order for them to be compared.Bacillus subtilis was grown and examined for endoglucanase synthesis in the presence of glucose and glycerol as energy sources with cellobiose and carboxymethylcellulose as inducers.  This organism was thereafter subjected to mutagenesis with ethyl methane sulfonate.  Mutants were isolated and tested for the ability to synthesize endoglucanase in the presence of the aforementioned energy sources and inducers.  The mutants were grouped into different classes on the basis of their induction ratios with respect to induction by carboxymethylcellulose.  Effect of growth phase on endoglucanase synthesis by each class of mutants was examined. The endoglucanase synthesized by the wild type and some selected mutants (M4 and M25) was partially purified (Ammonium sulphate fraction) and some properties of the enzyme were examined. The activities of the partially purified endoglucanase isolated from the wild type and two selected mutants were stimulated by Ca2+, Mg2+,K+, Na+ and NH4+ at certain concentrations but inhibition occurred with lodoacetic acid (IAA), Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 2,4-dinitrophenol, except in the case of strain M4, wherein the inhibitors stimulated, rather than inhibit.  The endoglucanase enzyme isolated from the mutant M25 and the wild type had their optimum activities at 35°C compared to the enzyme from mutant M4 which retained activity at 60°C, M4 enzyme was also able to tolerate boiling for 30 minutes.  Optimal enzyme activity was attained at 0.5% (W/V) carboxymethylcellulose for the wild type while the enzyme from mutants M4 and M25 required 0.2% (W/V).  The apparent K. values of the three partially purified endoglucanases for carboxymethylcellulose was found to be 0.40 mg/ml, 0.14 mg/ml and 0.55 mg/ml respectively for WT, and also M4 and M25.  The optimal pH value for the three strains however, was found to be 4.8.  The results of this work offered some information about the regulation of endoglucanase synthesis in Bacillus subtilis.

In audition, a detailed review of critical work on the writers was carried out.The study revealed that classes existed in Africa and that the African masses have always organized themselves to fight the dominant class. It has also shown that with the coming of colonialism, the exploitation of the masses by the dominant class increased fundamentally. The study showed that the two novelists have succeeded in exposing the class contradictions inherent in Africa.The study concluded that African novelists, especially Ngugi and Sembene, have been in the forefront of educating the masses through fictional works. They have been politically engaged. The study, however, observed ,that in spite of the conscientization programmes of the two writers through their novels, the African masses have not been able to do away with exploitation in its entirety.|Theses Collection|Textual and class analysis/Sembene Ousmane's God's Bits of Wood/Ngugi Wa Thiong 'O's  A Grain of Wheat/colonialism/dominant class/conscientization programmes/ exploitation/*||||||Kotchoni, Simeon Oloni|M|Studies on the regulation of cellulase synthesis in  Bacillus pumilus||||||M.Sc.

Cellulase production was carried out in this work in order to assess the regulatory synthesis of the enzyme, to isolate catabolite repression insensitive mutants and to characterize cellulases from the improved mutants and the wild-type.The organism was subjected to Ethyl Methane Sulphonate (EMS) mutagenesis, and grown for cellulase synthesis in presence or absence of glucose and glycerol as carbon sources, carboxymethyl-cellulose and cellobiuose as inducers.Forty mutants were isolated and studied for the regulation of cellulase synthesis. Mutants (Mu9 and Mul7) were discovered to produce cellulase in presence of high concentration of glucose. These were thus referred to as catabolite repression insensitive mutants (MuCRI6, MuCRI17), and were used together with the wild-type to assess the physical and chemical properties of the partially purified cellulase.The enzyme was found to be constitutively produced, most of the mutants and the wild-type enzyme were inducible and catabolite repression sensitive! Potent cellulase production was discovered at the exponential growth phase in the wild-type and mutants. This production system was referred to as total growth phase dependent. The enzyme was considerably denatured in high cultural agitation. Moreover, carboxymethylcellulase had the highest rate of induction when compared with that of cellobiose.The partially purified enzyme using ammonium sulphate was optimally active at pH 6.5, and at temperature of 50°C for the (MuCRI6, MuCRI17). All cations tested Ca2+ Mg2+, NH4, Na+, K+) stimulated the enzyme activity, but, odoacetic acid (IAA), Ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) and 2, 4- dinitrophenol (DNP) inhibited the enzyme activity. These findings provide information on the regulatory system of the cellulase gene in Bacillus pumilus, establish the optimum conditions for the enzyme activity and furnish details on the isolated mutants for cellulase production independent of substrate sources.|Theses Collection|Hydrolysis/mutants/Ethyl Methane Sulphonate (EMS) mutagenesis/cellulase synthesis/carboxymethyl-cellulose/catabolite repression insensitive mutants/high cultural agitation/Bacillus pumilus/glucose and glycerol *||||||Amoo, Emmanuel Olagunju|M|Community attitude towards female genital mutilation among the Yoruba in Odo-Otin local government area of Osun State, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

It measures the coverage and acceptability of the campaign against the practice of female-genital mutilation in the studied area.  The study empirically defined and specified how these variables operate in influencing the attitude of the community towards the practice of female genital mutilation.Collection of the data was by interview schedule. Two-hundred and ninety-seven (297) respondents (both male and female) were randomly interviewed from the three (3) selected wards from the same local government in the southern part of Osun State of Nigeria. The state is predominantly occupied and owned by the Yoruba tribe.The study tested four hypotheses. Frequency tables, cross tabulations and logit regression model were used in the analysis of the data collected from the field.The study revealed that more than two-third of the total respondents had circumcised at least a baby-girl. The prevalent rate of female genital mutilation is estimated as 75.4%.  The practice cuts across various socio-economic status of the respondents in the study area.  Although, respondents in different levels of education have practiced female circumcision, the practice is more pronounced among respondents with primary school education and below.  Furthermore, the study that farmer, artisans and full-time housewives are more likely to continue with the practice of female circumcision. The professionals and those in the clerical jobs showed less likelihood of practicing female circumcision. They also tend to be more against the practice of female genital mutilation than individuals in other occupations.  The Christians tend to stop the practice than the moslems.Awareness about the campaign against FGM is very low in the studied area. 0ver two-third claimed ignorance of the campaign.  Apart from individuals who had never heard about the campaign and were opposing it, the attitude of respondents that had known about the campaign was also unfavourable.The study established that mass literacy would bring a positive change to the success of the campaign against FGM.  A broad enlightenment campaign against this tradition and exposure of people to mass media would, if not totally enhance the eradication of the practice, limits its extension to the coming generation. However, it was discovered that the problem of FGM does not fall easily into the category of health problem for which solutions may be found within the medical  sector.|Theses Collection|Female genital mutilation/female-circumcision/mass literacy/campaign against female genetal mutilation/health problem/exposure of people to mass media/orthodox believe *||||||Bada, Tayo Abass|M|Some effects of visual realism on learners' acquisition of fine art concepts in junior secondary schools in Ife central local government area||||||M.A. Educational Technology|Kunle Akanbi||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Educational Technology|1998|||OAU|||||viii,78p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The study also investigated if the different degrees of visual realism portrayed in some presentation forms will affect significantly the performance of Fine Art learners.Four hundred Junior Secondary Three (J.S. III) students were used for the study. The students were selected through simple random sampling technique from five Secondary Schools in Ife Central Local Government Area of Osun State. The students were also randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The students exposed to Line, Colour and shaded illustrations constituted the experimental groups while students not exposed to any form of illustration constituted the control group. The treatment extended over four weeks of eight lessons. A Fine Art Achievement Test (FAAT) was administered. The Fine Art Achievement Test was administered as Pre-test and Post-test. The scores in the Pre-test and Post-test were analyzed using the two-tailed t-test.The results of the study showed that students taught Fine Art with illustration series performed significantly better than those taught without the use of illustration series (t=11.41, df.= 198. P < 0.05). The result of the study also showed that students taught with simple line drawings performed significantly batter  than those exposed to shaded doings (t=7.78, df.=198, P< 0.05). It was found that students who were taught Fine Art with simple has drawings also performed significantly better than students that were taught Fine Art with colour drawings (t= 3.47, df=198, P<   0.05). The results also revealed that students who were taught Fine Art with colour illustrations had a higher level of performance than students that were taught Fine Art with shaded illustrations (t 4.66, df=198, p< 0.05). From the findings of the study, the following conclusions were made; firstly, that the use of illustrations in instruction can significantly improve the students performance in Fine Art.

This was however more of price increase, because the volume of both exports actually declined during the period. Furthermore, the study confirmed that many new agricultural and manufactured exports have been introduced into the export profile in the adjustment period, even though little or no changes were observed in terms of foreign exchange mobilization.The study revealed that manufactured export growth rate was more impressive than agricultural export growth rate during the 1986 - 1995 period. However, in terms of the share of agricultural and manufactured export to total export, the performance is still very low as oil export has continued to dominate the export profile of the Nigerian economy. The study also showed that agricultural and manufactured exports contributed lesser to economic growth in the 1986 -1995 period when compared with the 1970 - 1985 period.There is therefore the need to initiate policies that will promote development of new export products and the processing of products hitherto exported raw. In addition, export of services should as well be developed, while diversification of exports towards faster growing markets will also be an appropriate measure to pursue.|Theses Collection|Structural changes in export/economic growth/manufactured export growth rate/price increase/foreign exchange mobilization/agricultural export growth rate/oil export/ diversification of exports   *||||||Famutimi, Eric Olusola|M|The reliability of forecasting of global geomagnetic events||||||M.Sc.

The commonest indices are the 3 hour K  index and the daily A index. K and Ak indices are used for characterizing localized geomagnetic field variation while Kp and Ap indices are for characterization of global geomagnetic field variation.The Ile--Ife observatory (a low latitude observatory) is equipped with a British Geological Survey (BGS) µD/µI Proton Vector Magnetometer (PVM) operating under the control of an IBM compatible PC which logs one minute geomagnetic field vectors. These vector measurements were made into daily magnetograms of H, D and Z which were further handscaled to 3 hour plots. The minimum - maximum method was used for calculating the range for each three hour interval and a simple program was written in BASIC to derive the K scale for Ile-Ife observatory. The data from the other observatories; College, Alaska in U.S.A. (upper latitude), Hartland in the United Kingdom, and Furstenfeldbruck in Germany (mid latitude) were extracted from bulletins containing K indices produced by the respective observatories. The 3 hour K indices for all the observatories were reduced to daily Ak indices by using standard conversion tablesThe reliability of the forecast of global Ap index, produced weekly by the Space Environmental Service Center (SESC) in Boulder, Colorado, U. S. A. was found by comparing it with the Ak indices for three consecutive years (1992, 1993 and 1994) for all the four observatories. This was done by correlating the observed Ak index at each observatory with the forecast Ap index made by SESC to reflect the annual, seasonal and latitudinal dependence of the forecast .The results showed that the calculated K scale for Ile-Ife follows the normal trend when compared with the K scales for other observatories at other latitudes. The result also showed that the forecast was least reliable in 1992, three years after the maximum sunspot number for solar cycle 22. It was also discovered that for each season (equinox, northern winter and northern summer), forecast is least reliable when an observatory receives maximum sunshine hours. The forecast was also found to be least reliable for Ile-Ife, a low latitude observatory. This is due to the fact that the Ile-Ife observatory, situated close to the equatorial electrojet zone has field variations, completely different from variations at high and mid latitude observatories. Since the magnetospheric and ionospheric parameters, which are inputs into the SESC forecast model are derived from high latitude observatories, such forecasts are therefore expected to be least reliable for predicting field variations at low latitudes like the Ile Ife observatory.The implications of the findings are that the forecast Ap index is least reliable in the prediction of localized geomagnetic field variation during high geomagnetic activity and for low latitude observatories. Since low latitude observatories have their own unique field variations completely different from those obtainable at high and mid latitude, it was recommended that a model that will take this peculiarity into consideration should be devised for forecasting field variations at low latitude observatories. It is believed this will be a challenging future research interest.|Theses Collection|Earth's magnetic field/geomagnetic field variation/Proton Vector Magnetometer/Space Environmental Service Center/latitude observatories/magnetograms*||||||Famakinwa, Jimoh Olanipekun|M|A philosophical defense of moral realism||||||M.A. Philosophy|Jare Oladosu||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Philosophy|1998|||OAU|||||xi,70p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

In the process, the study has developed a new framework for analysing Nigerian politics which is ethno-patrimonial incorporation. Moreover, since its focus was outside the usual formal electoral politics, the study has expanded the frontiers of democratic theory significantlyBoth quantitative and qualitative methodologies were employed; the quantitative data was collected in Akwa Ibom State from 1240 samples in three different categories. For the 600 masses and 600 non-political/non-policy elites, the questionnaire was used, while interview was used for the 40 political/policy elites. Frequency distribution, percentage count, and chi-square statistics were used to distinguish the uniquely grassroots perceptions from elites' regarding democratic participation. The findings of the study confirmed Nigeria as a neo-patrimonial state. For instance, it was found that the grassroots people feel represented in government only when they have access to the policy makers who are their members acting as patrons to their respective communities. While the elites would prefer democratic governments, the grassroots masses would support any government, including the military that can cater for their welfare.  Another finding showed that accountability of state officers to their respective communities increased with the quantity of state largesse they cornered for their communitiesFurthermore, both elites and masses objected to open democratization of fundamental grassroots institutions such as traditional rulership and the church. These findings indicate a weak democratic culture among Nigerians. The study then suggested that to promote and stabilise grassroot democracy and limit the influence of patrimonialism in Nigeria, there should be structural re-organisation of the political system to accommodate wider participation. Also, the autonomy of grassroot democratic institutions should be increased vis-a-vis the national and state bodies.  In addition, secondary organisations and the civil societies at the grassroots should be encouraged to democratise their operational procedures so as to encourage the dissemination of democratic values to the wider society|Theses Collection|Legitimacy for political regimes/non-political/non-policy elites/policy-making/neo-patrimonial state/accountability/traditional rulership/church/democratic culture/democratic values*||||||Folorunsho, Benjamin Ayodele|M|A dynamic specification of aggregate money demand function in Nigeria  1960-1995||||||M.Sc.

It also verifies the existence or otherwise of a stable long run money demand function for the same period.We employed the recently developed econometric techniques of co integration and Error- Correction Mechanism (ECM) which most analysts have found to be very adequate for handling economic data, particularly in LDCs, to estimate the demand for money equation using quarterly data. The time series property of variables of interest was first of all investigated by testing for their stationarity using the Dickey-Fuller (DF) and the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests. This was then followed by testing for co integration among the variables which appear in the specified aggregate money demand model.The ensuing tests failed to reject the null hypothesis that these variables are non-stationary. It was found also that long run equilibrium relationship existed between nominal (or real) money stock and nominal (or real) incomes.The evidence also shows that real M1 and M2 balances are co integrated with real income. This implies that there exists a stable long run demand function for real M1 and M2 balances as a function of real income and other explanatory variables. Our results confirm that money demand in Nigeria has remained stable, but the dynamic adjustment processes are more complex than those presented in earlier studies.As our results show that the discrepancy between the actual and desired real money holdings in the previous period is not fully corrected in the present period, we recommend that the disequilibrium in the money market can be exploited by the authority to influence real income. Thus, effective control of money holdings can be achieved through the adoption of an appropriate income policy and not via domestic interest rate since this variable is not significant in our model.|Theses Collection|Demand for money/co integration and error- correction Mechanism/LDCs/Dickey-Fuller (DF) and the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests/long run equilibrium/nominal (or real) incomes/nominal (or real) money stock/money market/income policy/domestic interest rate   *||||||Ibironke, Olabode|M|Power and narrative strategies in Maryse Conde's Segu and  Chinua Achebe's  Anthills of the Savannah||||||M.A. Literature in English|Oyin Ogunba||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, English|1998|||OAU|||||x,138p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

It was also revealed that the present hegemonic relations in Africa are heavily informed by certain historical antecedents and that the (desirable) terminus of the unfolding political history is democracy, achievable through an acquired culture of rational awareness.The study concluded that the primary historical preoccupation of the two novelists with power has the advantage of analytical neutrality that the Liberal and Dialectical theories may not guarantee, and has transformed the novelistic poetics by redefining the realistic and modernist conceptions and practices of the novel genre, in the African and Caribbean literatures.|Theses Collection|Power and the dynamics of truth/aesthetic/archaeological methodology/heterogeneous/matrix of individuation/democracy/political history/hegemonic relations/liberal and dialectical theories/African and Caribbean literatures   *||||||Ibrahim, Sidi Attimou|F|A critical exploration of the use of marxist ideology in selected plays of  Femi  Osofisan||||||M.A. Literature in English|Oyin Ogunba||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, English|1998|||OAU|||||viii,90p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

These plays are Who is Afraid of Solarin?   No more the Wasted Breed,  Another Raft, and Once Upon Four Robbers.  Marxist literary theory was used for the study with a particular emphasis on its sociological component..Essentially, the Justification for this study was that although there exist critical works on Osofisan's drama, it was observed that such works were more concerned with close textual analysis. Their focus was, therefore, not sociological. This study attempted a textual and sociological analysis.Methodologically, the study relied upon relevant literature on the subject as well as a diligent study of the selected plays. One was fully convinced that this method would adequately reveal the nuances that define the ideological and socio-aesthetic vision of the dramatist.   It  was observed that although Osofisan is a leftist oriented artist, he does not espouse crude Marxism in these dramas. The plays under study dramatize, criticize, and at times question and synthesized some societal values in a highly eclectic manner, the playwright tries to persuade the audience or readers, through entertainment and instruction, to accept and effect a socio-political and religious change to reorganize the society on basic socialist principles.Therefore, the study concluded that Osofisan's plays are not only of great aesthetic value, but are also very significant within the parlance of socio-political and economic restructuring.|Theses Collection|Marxist ideology/dramatists/Who is Afraid of Solarin?/Another Raft/Once Upon Four Robbers/textual and sociological analysis/No more the Wasted Breed/ideological and socio-aesthetic vision/leftist oriented artist/ *||||||Oguntula, Olukunle Olusina|M|Retirement planning among academic staff of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife||||||M.Sc.

Of the 319 adolescents interviewed, 4 out of every 10 were sexually active and were most likely to have unprotected sex at last intercourse.On average, sexual activities for the girls began at 17.7 years. Adolescents interviewed were most knowledgeable about condom and rhythm methods and they were least likely to know of male sterilization and IUD methods. About half of respondents are currently using contraceptives. However, contraceptive use consisted mostly of the ineffective methods such as rhythm (51.4%) and withdrawal (28.2%).  Bivariate and multivariate analysis reveals that more adolescents in rural areas practiced contraception than their counterparts in urban areas. Due to high use of ineffective methods, 44% of those sexually active had experienced pregnancy. Consequently, about 56.2% ended in abortion with adolescents aged 20-24 reporting more incidences of pregnancy termination than those aged 10-19 with nearly all resuming sexual activity after their abortion. Findings also reveal that more adolescents now procure abortion from the private hospitals other than the self-induced abortion which characterized the earlier studies.Repeat pregnancy among adolescents is not common thus suggesting that adolescents might have begun to use contraceptives after their first experience. However, only 20% of adolescents used contraception after their last birth.|Theses Collection|Level of adolescent sexuality/sexual relations/repeat pregnancies/contraceptive use/abortion/male sterilization and IUD methods/sexually active*||||||Bamigbade, Waheed Adeyimika|M|A stylistic study of the language of the english translation of the Quran||||||M.A. English|C.C.

The approach adopted has been that of General Stylistics which seeks to analyse language habits, describe the patterns which differentiate the aspects of language     variation such that it could explain as far as possible why people "choose" to speak or write in a certain way, and then determine what alternative forms of expression they choose to use or ignore in particular situations.The text of the Qur'an was studied and some passages were selected as data, after which the stylistically distinctive features in the language were identified and categorised, analysed and discussed.It was discovered that the Qur'an exhibits in its language a lot of stylistic features, all of which make it a book held in high esteem and with lots of influence on its readers. Really, the claim of the Qur'an (or of the believers in it) to inimitability resides not just in the content but largely in the style of its language.The thesis concludes that the language of the Qur'an as a variety of the language of religion is able to achieve its success, linguistically, as a monumental book of esteem and influence through lots of stylistic devices identifiable in its content.|Theses Collection|Language habits/stylistic features/language of the Qur'an/language of religion/linguistically/english version of the Qur'an *||||||Ayansiji, Oluwafemi Ayantoke|F|Women in indigenous governance and development in Ode-Omu||||||M.Sc.

The study was prompted by the discussion in literature on the marginalization of women in governance and in the development process in Africa.Both primary and secondary sources of data collection were employed in the execution of the project. Primary information was sourced mainly through the focused group discussion method and interviews with key individuals in the community, who were informed enough about the position of women in the administration of community affairs in Ode-Omu. Secondary information was sourced from books, journals, and other relevant publications.The study discovered that women in Ode-Omu have been actively involved in governance and in the promotion of social and economic development. As regards governance, women have been active in the maintenance of law and order, they also occupy key positions in the traditional administrative machinery.In the area of socio_economic development women have been active in the management of market structures and exchange relationships. For example, women fix prices of goods, or commodities that are brought to the market. In addition, they organised themselves into pressure groups to fight inflation and exploitation especially by public transport drivers and local government officials.Women also play key roles in community development projects (CD). They mobilize themselves through their various clubs and associations to raise funds for community development projects, and for organised labour.The welfare of women is also found to be a responsibility that receives a great attention by the women in the community. The thrift and credit societies are institutional arrangements used by the women to assist each other in times of needs.  The study made some recommendations on how women's participation in governance and in promoting development can be enhanced in the community concerned. One of such recommendations is that women should be given more incentives to participate in governance and developmental processes in the community. They should not be suppressed or estranged from the policies put in place in order for the society to tap their inherent potentials, as the level of women's emancipation is said to be in part, the national measure of the emancipation of the whole society.|Theses Collection|Marginalization of women in governance/pressure groups/exploitation/community development projects/thrift and credit societies/management of market structures and exchange relationships *||||||Alli, Otitoloju Raphael|M|The effects of contractual claims on the delivery of building projects in Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

It also investigated the relationships between contractual claims, completion cost and Project duration.Data used for the study were obtained using two methods.  First, multiple choice questionnaire was administered to construction professionals in Government, Contractor and Consultant organisation in order to elicit information on factors responsible for contractual claims. Second, cost data were obtained on Sixty (60) projects executed between 1992 - 1997.  The data were gathered from archival sources such as bills of quantities and final accounts of the projects. The analyses of the data collected were carried out using descriptive and inferential statistics.The results showed that over 70% of all projects executed on contract basis were subject to cost and time overruns of about 26% and 32% respectively on the average. It was also found that factors like changing and unpredictable costs of construction inputs, poor project planning and documentation, contributed significantly to the occurrence of such overruns. The results further revealed that there was a positive correlation between contractual claims and cost and time overruns of the projects.From the study, it was recommended among others, that positive steps ought to be taken by clients, contractors, professionals and government works department to ensure better awareness of the different conditions of contract and their applications under the emerging delivery systems. It further recommended that better planning and documentation of projects under a stabilized economy are areas that needed to be addressed so that cost and time overruns resulting from contractual claims could be reduced significantly.|Theses Collection|Contractual claims/completion cost and Project duration/archival sources/cost and time overruns/project planning and documentation/stabilized economy/bills of quantities and final accounts of the projects  *||||||Feyisetan, Oluwadaisi  Isaac|M|Morbidity and  mortality among under-five children in Ekiti and Ondo States||||||M.Sc.

The data used were collected in 1991/92 in the old Ondo state (now Ekiti and Ondo States) from 1695 women of reproductive age.The objectives of the project include, identifying people's perceptions of the ethiology of certain childhood diseases (especially diarrhea and measles), and to determine the impact of such perception on health seeking behaviour; to determine mother's knowledge and use of health seeking behaviour and other child care practices on child mortality and mortality.Tables were generated at both univariate, bivariate and multivariate levels to determine the influence of independent variables on the selected dependent variables. The hypotheses of the study include: the mother's preventive and curative practices influence under five mortality level in Ekiti and Ondo states; the higher the level of education of the women the lower the under five mortality; mothers who have rational perception of disease causation are more likely to seek modern therapeutic measures when their children are ill than their counterparts who have less rational perception of disease causation; mothers who adopt medical preventive and therapeutic measure are likely to experience lower infant and child mortality than their counterparts who adopt traditional methods.The mean children ever born reported for the women is 3.93.  Some of the women characteristics identified for this study include mothers age and education status, sources of drinking water, sanitation, health care index (variables derived from vaccinations and immunizations) and place of residence.Based on the findings, it is recommended that programmes be put in place urgently to check any possible upward surge of under five mortality and infant morbidity in the country. The government and non-governmental organization should cooperate in this venture; specific programmes should be put in place to combat specific causes of under five deaths; and programmes to enhance women's education and economic status should be put in place to enable them to provide better health care and health conditions to members of their families.|Theses Collection|Reproductive age/ethiologyof childhood diseases/child care practices/mortality and mortality/level of education/therapeutic measures/traditional methods/vaccinations and immunizations/*||||||Eke, Gabriel  Enyeribe|M|The management of economic liberalization in Nigeria 1980-1995||||||M.Sc.

This has led to the introduction of many policy measures since 1986, all aimed at reviving the economy. The study is an embodiment of interplay of various factors ranging from the author's intellectual background to his personal experiences of the Nigerian socio-economic and political formation especially in the last two decades.The focus of the study is on management and implementation of economic liberalization in Nigeria. The current approach to liberalization in the governmental institutions has emerged as an issue of concern both to the government and civil servants in the system. The study therefore sought to assess the liberalization approach with a view to identifying the inherent problems as well as advancing suggestions for an effective policy implementation in Nigeria.The primary data were collected through the interview method, while secondary data were collected from relevant library and documentary sources.Our findings confirmed that the implementation of the Structural Adjustment Programme in Nigeria has been defective because of planning and lack of programme evaluation. Besides, corrupt practices by government officials have worsened the situation by preventing proper implementation of the programme.The study recommended that government should combat all frauds that occur in the formal and informal sectors of the Nigerian economy. The focus of government should be directed to revamping the agricultural sector. Furthermore, government should review its policy on privatization, since the policy has not really assisted in revamping the Nigerian economy.There is the need for a conscious, enlightened and purposeful leadership, with a sense of mission and with a determined populace that are easily accessible for mobilization. The general awareness should be consequently instilled in the minds of the people on the need for the promotion of collective state interest.|Theses Collection|Governmental institutions/economic liberalization/policy implementation/ Structural Adjustment Programme/programme evaluation/corruption/revamping the agricultural sector/privatization/state interest/enlightened and purposeful leadership *||||||Ekeleme, Friday|M|Effect of fallow management on weed population dynamics in the forest zone of southwestern Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Botany|A.O.

The objectives were to understand and evaluate the population dynamics as well as the long-term patterns of arable weeds under contrasting cropping and fallow management systems and to specifically identify factors that promote the preponderance of weeds in arable land.The study was conducted in a randomised split plot configuration with natural bush fallow and two planted fallows of Pueraria phaseoloides and Leucaena leucocephala as main treatment. Subplot treatments were zero fallow and 1 to 3 years of fallow rotation after one year of cropping.  The patterns of seedling emergence, survival, mortality and the dynamics of total and individual species weed population were monitored in two 1 m x 1 m quadrats every fortnight. Data on weed seed rain was collected within 4 m x 4 m quadrat in seed traps made of a petri-dish and a piece of paper sprayed with an aerosol. Soil for seed bank analysis was collected within a 4 m x 4 m quadrat along diagonal transects. Soil samples collected for seed bank was also analysed for pH, total nitrogen, organic carbon, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium.  Photosynthetically active radiation was measured in each 4 m x 4 m quadrat.  These variables were used in a multivariate analysis to determine their influence on weed species distribution.Results showed that the number of seedlings recruited in Pueraria plots was significantly lower compared to the number of recruits in Leucaena and natural bush plots, respectively.  Mean total number of seedlings that emerged in the various systems increased as the frequency of cultivation was increased.  Mortality was higher in plots cultivated after Leucaena fallow. Seedling mortality was highest in continuously cultivated plots in all the fallow systems. Major peaks of seedling emergence occurred at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 WAP.  Ageratum conyzoides, Synedrella nodiflora and Euphorbia hirta dominated early peaks and Chromolaena the later peaks. Seed bank, seed rain, PAR, pH and P drove species distribution in the three systems. Species mostly affected by these factors were Setaria longiseta, Euphorbia hirta, Euphorbia heterophylla, Ageratum conyzoides, Synedrella nodiflora, and Cassia hirsuta. Seed rain was highest in continuously cultivated plot. Total seed rain was lower in plots under Pueraria fallow management. Major peaks of seed dispersal occurred in August, 13-15 weeks after planting (WAP) and September (19-21 WAP). Ageratum, Synedrella, E. hirta, Digitaria horizontalis, Brachiaria deflexa, and Mariscus alternifolius dominated the seed rain. The larger seed rain in continuously cultivated plots contributed to the build up of weeds in the seed bank.It is concluded that intensification of cropping systems drives weed seed rain and seed bank to higher densities and consequently leads to high weed pressure in arable land. Incorporation of herbaceous cover crops like Pueraria into cropping systems would keep weed pressure in arable fields at low levels.|Theses Collection|International Institute of Tropical Agriculture/cropping and fallow management systems/Pueraria phaseoloides/Leucaena leucocephala/organic carbon/ Photosynthetically active radiation/weed species distribution/Synedrella nodiflora/herbaceous cover crops*||||||Eleruja, Marcus Adebola|M|Preparation and characterization of metallorganic chemical vapour deposited (MOCVD) mixed metal oxide ( Ax Mi-x O; A==Li; Na; M==Ni; Co )||||||Ph.D. Physics|E.O.B.

This was achieved through the pyrolysis of single solid source precursors, alkali-transition metal Acetylacetonates. The precursors were pyrolysed at 350 °C, showing a deposition temperature lower than those reported earlier for single and mixed metal oxide thin films prepared by the same method.Lithium and Sodium could not be detected by both Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) and Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS), but the properties showed some departure from those of the basic oxides, NiO and CoO. The SEM micrographs of the thin films showed that the films are pinhole free, that is, they are continuous.The prepared thin films, Li-Co-O, Na-Co-O, Li-Ni-O and Na-Ni-O were found to have narrower energy gaps than those of their pure oxides, CoO and NiO. The energy gaps of Li-Co-O, Na-Co-O, Li-Ni-O and Na-Ni-O were found to be 2.12 ± 0.05 eV, 2.05 ± 0.05 eV, 3.15 ± 0.05 eV and 3.40 ± 0.05 eV respectively.The electrical conductivity measurements showed that both Li-Co-O and Li-Ni-O thin films are semiconductors which have hopping activation energies of 0.133 ± 0.01 eV and 0.11 ± 0.01 eV respectively.

Enteropathogenic, enterotoxigenic, entroinvasive, enterohaemorrhagic and enteroaggregative  E. coli are definitive causes of infantile diarrhoea whereas the role of diffusely adherent, cell detarching and cytolethal distending E.coli in the aetiology of the disease is putative. E. coli is also known to harbour chromosomal and extrachromosomal genes mediating antibiotic resistance which may cause problems in the treatment of infection caused by the organism and related pathogens to which it ratty transfer these characters.This study evaluated the role of E. coli is a diarrhoeal pathogen in rural and sub-urban localities within South West Nigeria as well s the virulence characteristics of the isolates obtained, employing contemporary genotypic and phenotypic methods. The work also examined the types and nature of antibiotic resistance markers carried by the strains isolated, their relationship to virulence properties as well as factors that may contribute to their selection and spread within the communities studied.The results demonstrate that E. coli is important cause of infantile diarrhoea within the study environment. Strains belonging to all the currently known diarrhoeagenic E. coli pathotypes were recovered with those bearing plasmid borne virulence genes featuring more prominently than those that depend on chromosomal loci for their pathogenicity. One such class, enteroaggregative E. coli, was the most fequently isolated pathotype and together with heat-labile enterotoxin-producing E. coli, was significantly associated with diarrhoea. Furthermore, many of the strains isolated differed from prototypic descriptions from each class or belonged to atypical serovars. In the course of the study, genes encoding Shingella enterotoxin 1 were detected in enteroaggregative E. coli, enteroaggregative heat stable enterotonin  in shingilla and cytolethal distending toxin-production in E. coli O157:NM.  Two novel putative toxins were identified in the course of the  study a plasmid encoded shiga toxin homologue and a previously underscribed cytoskeleton modifying toxin.  Resistance to trimethoprim, sulphonamides, ampicillin, cephalotin, tetracycline and streptomycin was seen in over 40% of isolates and was most frequently encountered in E.coli .  Resistance to chloramphenicol, spectinomycin and gentamicin was  was susceptible to nalidixic acid and the fluoroquinolones. The incidence of antibiotic resistance varied with pathotype, being most commonly observed with enteroaggregative and cell detaching E. coli.Factors that may have contributed t o the high incidence of antibiotic resistance encountered in the study include excessive and inappropriate antibiotic prescription within the study area as well as the person-to-person transfer of resistant organisms. Conjugative plasmids were found to be responsible for the dissemination of multiple resistance and virulence characters among strains harboured by the study population. The study demonstrated that the exchange of genetic material among E. coli within this environment is contributing to an increase in the number of virulent clones, the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and the evolution of new pathotypes.|Theses Collection|Chromosomal and extrachromosomal genes/antibiotic resistance/diarrhoeagenic E. coli/Shingella enterotoxin/cytoskeleton modifying toxin/ampicillin/nalidixic acid and the fluoroquinolones/Conjugative plasmids/virulent clones*||||||Okeya, Isaac Olubanji|M|Model study for the improvement of female literacy and enrolment policy in southwestern Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

Also, the study shows the effect of the current economic crisis on the education sector.The present study used participatory methodologies to determine gender differentials in literacy and enrolment, attitudes, perceptions and constraints to female education. Structural questionnaire was the major instrument used to collect the data.  The study was conducted in two local government areas documented to be the poorest both in Osun and Oyo States, focusing on two communities (Ogbaagbaa and Iwo-Ate) with obvious gender gaps.The multi-stage and stratified sampling techniques were used to select 127 respondents in Ogbaagbaa and 65 respondents in Iwo-Ate.  Descriptive statistics, mainly frequency distributions were used to present the qualitative and quantitative data collected.  The reality and extent of gender disparity in literary and enrolment was established in favour of the boy-child. There was gender disparity of 9 percent in Ogbaagbaa and 6.6 percent in Iwo-Ate in the enrolment rates against the girl-child. Also, there was gender disparity of 9.6 percent in Ogbaagbaa and 15.9 percent in Iwo-ate against the women.Basically, economic recession, inflation, unemployment and poverty and the assumption that the returns on boy's education are higher than those of girls made poor families to give preference to boy's education. Other constraints included unwanted pregnancy, early marriage, the high unemployment rate, bad economy, financial constraints, prejudice against females, ignorance and illiteracy.To improve female literacy and enrolment the targets of the study recommended that government should provide education facilities, make education free, improve teaching standards, embark on public enlightenment programmes, introduce family life education and compulsory female education. Also suggested were job creation, vocational education, an improved salary structure for teachers, and single sex schools. It was recommended that parents should also be counselled against early marriage and purdah'.Based on the above suggestions it is recommended that the educational infrastructure should be improved.  Public enlightenment programmes should be organised to sensitise parents against female prejudice.  Parents' and teachers' associations should be organised to strengthen parent-teacher relationships.  School syllabuses should be stabilised to enable siblings to share books. Free education should be introduced so that poor parents can send their wards to school.|Theses Collection|Gender differentials in literacy and enrolment/constraints to female education/economic recession/early marriage/ignorance and illiteracy/ family life education/improved salary structure for teachers/educational infrastructure/school syllabuses/free education *||||||Okejiri, Ephraim Chukwuma|M|Capability development in adopting active technology transfer strategy in Nigerian industries||||||Ph.D. Technology Management|F.E.

This development strategy which emerged post Second World War era had roots in the evolutionary theory of social change.  Its popularity in the developing world notwithstanding, the strategy has failed to improve living standards in most of the countries that adopted it. New theories have revealed that the main source of economic growth is not the accumulation of capital, but the expansion of capabilities of the people of a nation.  These capabilities are acquired through learning.  Foreign industrial plants are important because they provide learning opportunities for acquiring the technological capabilities. This research focused on the learning opportunities provided by production systems in Nigerian manufacturing industries. Its objectives include: assessing the institutional framework for technology transfer; examining firm-level technological activities; evaluating some common learning opportunities in the manufacturing industries and; building an active technology transfer model.The methodological approach encompassed questionnaire survey of selected manufacturing industries using stratified random sampling technique, industrial visits for on-the-spot assessment of production operations and interviews of both management and operational personnel. Secondary data were collected from reports of government agencies and the manufacturing industries. The data collected were subjected to chi-square and correlation analysis amongst others.The study revealed that technology-related laws in Nigeria were not explicitly directed at learning and acquiring technological capabilities. Efforts made towards the regulation of foreign technology transfer have been directed at reducing foreign exchange outflow.  The study also revealed that technological activities in the manufacturing industries in Nigeria are quite limited and are characterized by low technical competent workforce, very little in-house research and development (R&D) activities and weak inter-firm technological collaborations.  It was found that though there existed many opportunities for learning to acquire technological capabilities in the manufacturing industries, the potentials were grossly neglected.|Theses Collection|Technology acquisition strategy/theory of social change/living standards/accumulation of capital/human resource development/technology transfer/technology-related laws in Nigeria/foreign exchange outflow/little research and development*||||||Faturoti, Olusegun Rotimi|M|Ayewo ipa ti awon Olopaa ko ninu Iwe Itan aroso Yoruba||||||M.A. Yoruba|A.

Oral interviews were also conducted among the indigenous speakers with the view to giving traditional backing to the understanding of some Yoruba social systems.In all human societies and through the ages, policemen play vital roles in the maintenance of law and order, Hence, members of the public are inclined to look up to them as symbols of hope. However, this thesis found that some policemen have deviated from such noble roles. This is due to some factors among which are the desiresof the power-holders to use them for their selfish ends and the desire of certain opportunistic policemen to line their pockets, among others. The thesis concluded that policemen too, like any other person in the contemporary corrupt ridden society, are influenced by surrounding circumstances as accurately depicted by some Yoruba novelists through their creative abilities.|xi,127p|||||||Yoruba||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The study established that Yoruba dialectal findings will help tremendously in reappraising the grammar of the standard Yoruba language.The analysis was based largely on the theory of the Generalised Phase Structure Grammar (GPSG) as described by Gazdar (et al) in 1985. GPSG is a deliberate reaction to Chomsky's dismissal of non-transformational phrase structure grammar. The grammar is rnonostratal in that it posits only one level of syntactic representation. The methodology employed included the use of relevant books, sentences extracted from native speakers' speeches and the oral interviews conducted for some of the speakers of Ijesa dialect.The study differentiated between the various markers of Tense, Aspect and Modal Systems of the Ijesa dialect and those of the Standard Yoruba language. The central part of the research is devoted mainly to the identification and description of various markers of these grammatical items, the detailed functions and structural co-occurrence of these markers in the Ijesa dialect and, the semantic implications of Tense, Aspect and Modal Systems in some Ijesa dialectal constructions.

Quite a number of empirical studies over the years have demonstrated the importance of trade on economic growth in developing countries.  A quantitative assessment of the relative impact of outward orientation on economic growth would shed more light on the efficacy of this strategy and contribute to the on going debate on trade liberalization in Sub-Saharan African countries.We employed the recently developed econometric technique of Co-integration and Error Correction Modelling (ECM) which most analysts have found to be very adequate for handling economic data, particularly in LDCs to estimate the main equation in our research work.  To confirm structural shift in our parameters, we divided the period into two (before and after adjustment) and compared the estimated parameters using Chow tests.   Furthermore, a thorough analysis of the effect of trade policies on economic growth was investigated.The results obtained from our investigation confirmed our main objective that openness affects economic growth, But from the estimated equation, capital and labour promotes economic growth as their coefficients are positive and numerically significant.  The Chow tests revealed that there was a structural shift and this could be explained by openness which was engendered in the trade liberalization policy stance of the government post- structural adjustment.|Theses Collection|Trade liberalization/developing countries/Co-integration and Error Correction Modelling/Chow tests/trade policies/structural adjustment*||||||Onipede, Abimbola Taiwo|M| The United Nations and conflict management in Cambodia||||||M.Sc.

This is why the issue of conflict and how to contain it have become a prominent phenomenon in the contemporary international politics. This study examines a particular conflict and focuses on the involvement of the United Nations Organisation through a `peace building' body known as United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) in the prolonged fraticidal war that has ravaged the Indochinese state of Cambodia for more than two decades.Based on the fact that this is not the United Nation's first attempt at maintaining international peace and security, the study also discusses the peace-keeping operation of the Organisation in some other similar selected conflicts in international politics.Moreover, in tracing the historical development of Cambodia, the study gives a critical analysis of the remote and immediate factors, the domestic and external causes, as well as the trigger- mechanisms, including the series of escalation and de-escalation that are involved in the unnecessary prolongation of the Cambodian conflict.  However, it is discovered from our study that apart from the radical nature of Prince Norodom Sihanouk who led the Cambodia's vehement resistance against the French attempt at recolonizing the state which resulted into Cambodia's severance of connection with the French Union on 9th November 1953, most other factors that exacerbated the Cambodian conflict are extraneous. The emergence of the Pol Pot - led Khmer Rouge regime on the Cambodian political scene actually heightened the international dimensions of the crisis. Cambodia thus became a hot-pot of ideological rivalry among the super powers of the cold war era.Finally, the study discovers that the solution to the Cambodian crisis lies not in the military confrontation and open hostility that have almost totally destroyed the people's traditional way of life, the social structure as well as every vestige of human freedom but in open diplomacy.|Theses Collection|International politics/United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia/fraticidal war/Prince Norodom Sihanouk/Pol Pot - led Khmer Rouge regime/ideological rivalry/super powers/cold war *||||||Onasoga, Oluwakemi  Adenike|F|Multinational oil corporrtions and environmental challenges in the Nigerian oil industry||||||M.Sc.

This work assumes that in actualising this purpose, MNOCs operations have not been consistent with good oilfield practice and have therefore had dire consequences on the environment and people of the host communities in the Niger-Delta region of Nigeria. To this extent, the study examines the impact and consequences of MNOCs operations on the Niger-Delta environment, their efforts at preventing and controlling oil pollution and rehabilitating unavoidably polluted areas, as well as determining MNOCs level of compliance with international and national standards and guidelines on environmental protection.Data for the work were collected during field trips to various oil producing areas, and during interviews with the oil producing communities and experts on MNOCs and environmental issues. These were supplemented with extracts from published and unpublished scholarly works. The data obtained were analysed using a descriptive and analytical method.With the aid of the methodology used, the research reveals that in their operations in Nigeria, MNOCs have not always conformed with "good oilfield practices". This failure, it is discovered has dire consequences for both the environment and people of the host communities in the Niger Delta .  It has led to deforestation, damaged landforms, and vast pollution and devastation of cultivable land. Also, wells, ponds, creeks and rivers have been polluted, aquatic lives negatively impacted on and in some cases there has been loss of fish, crustaceans and other aquatic animals. These have significantly led to the pauperization of the host communities whose means of livelihood are negatively affected, thereby causing social upheavals in the Niger - Delta. The study also reveals that in recent times, the MNOCs have made efforts to improve on their operations.  However, such efforts have not been sufficient. This is attributed in part to the Nigerian government's inability to control the oil multinationals due too the nations excessive dependence on oil as major currency earner, as well as the nations dependency on the have multinationals for crucial oil technology; and inadequate and ineffective legislation especially in the oil industry. The state is seen to demonstrate lack of necessary willpower and commitment to environmental protection issues.Subsequently, the findings indicate that there is need for a policy change, where ecological concerns are integrated into economic initiatives right from the formulation stage through to the implementation processes.|Theses Collection|Business entities/Niger-Delta region of Nigeria/multinational oil corporations/oil pollution/environmental protection/deforestation/devastation of cultivable land/government policies/oil as amono-economy/inadequate and ineffective legislation*||||||Ola, Elizabeth Eluyomi|F|The role of South Africa in southern African development community (SADC) in the post-apartheid era||||||M.Sc.

This event formally brought to an end decades of intra-sub regional hostility which had hitherto pitted apartheid South Africa against its neighbours in the SADC and had caused the organizations members considerable economic dislocation, destruction of infrastructure and loss of lives.The central objective of this study therefore is an examination of the impact that the presence of post-apartheid South Africa is likely to have on the integrative process in the sub-region.  This is necessary, considering its policies of sub-regional destabilization in the heyday of apartheid, as well as its singular preponderance in the economic, industrial and military spheres and its vast resources endowments to enable us determine whether its presence in the SADC would equitably benefit all members or create relationship of dependency.In earring out the research, the study relies mostly on secondary sources of information available in existing scholarly works, periodicals and academic journals.  Reference is also made to primary sources which include official publications of the SADC, official policy statements on SADC, SADC's annual report, resolutions and statistical data.  Both sources of data allowed us to make a descriptive analysis of events going on in the sub- region.Making use of the above sources the study delves into the evolution of the SADC, the factors that necessitated its formation, its composition and its progress till date, and the negative activities of apartheid South Africa which threatened its survival.  The study also identifies the factors that have made South Africa the sub-regional giant that it is, and its impact and influence in the sub-region.The study reveals that in spite of attempts to forge real partnership with the countries in the SADC, South Africa nonetheless still looms large with latent capacity to subordinates others to its will if it so desires.

Significantly, the search for peace and security in the global setting has for long remained the major pre-occupation of statesmen and intellectuals alike.  The consensus about the crucial role of communication in global security not in question.  What however a subject of debate is the extent in which communication could be used as an instrument of resolving conflicts and wars in the contemporary International Relations.  In the light of this, the study examines the roles, evolution and general nature of communication, with various related theories associated with it.  In doing this, the thesis attempts to substantiate the claim that communication reinforces andperpetuate peace and security in the international system.A descriptive, historical approach is employed for the study.  Data were obtained from two main sources, primary and secondary sources like books, journals, periodicals and magazines.The study finds out that the efficacy or otherwise of communication in relation to security as often been criticized in-spite of it's positive influences.  It is concluded however that it is also an instrument of promoting conflicts and wars.Nevertheless, the study finally concludes that adequate and effective communication system is a very significant factor for promoting, ensuring and maintaining peace and security in the contemporary international relations.|Theses Collection|International system/conflict/wars/peace/statesmen/communication in global security/evolution and nature of communication*||||||Olagunju, Anthony Olalere|M|Geological and geophysical evaluation of a residual clay deposit at Ikere- Ekiti, southwest Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The clay mineral fraction by simple beneficiation process shows considerable enhancement in the kaolinite content (88% - 100%) and depletion, in quartz (0 - 10%) and goethite (0 - 1%)		The chemical composition of the clay deposit predominantly consists of SiO2 (47.70% - 61.68%), Al203 (20.95% - 26.48%), Fe2O3 (2.37% - 7.60%) and H2O (6.05% - 9.08%) whilst CaO (0.65%-1.03%), K2O (0.24%-0.65%), TiO2 (2.20%-3.84%), P2O5 (2.37%-4.18%) and MgO (0.64%-1.07%) occur in lower concentrations.  Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr and Ni were detected in trace amounts in the deposits and their presence is attributable to adsorption effect. The various tests of physical properties show the clay deposit to be of medium to high plasticity (plastic index 3.88% - 25.01%), loss on ignition (6.05% - 8.08%) and of  high compressive strength.  The vertical electrical sounding reveals four geoeletric layers. The first layer is the top-soil with thickness ranging from 0.6m-1.5m and resistivity of 140 ohm-m to 1200 ohm-m. The second layer is the lateritic/sandy clay layer with thickness ranging from0.8m 15.7w and resistivity values of between 285 ohm-m and 2812 ohm-m. The third layer is theclay layer with thickness ranging from 17.0m to 98.6m and resistivity values ranging from 52 ohm-m to 350 ohm-m.    The fourth layer is the bedrock composed of basement rocks with infinite resistivity.  The physical, chemical and mineralogical of rocks  estimated to be 2.86 x 10.6 tonnes while the volume of the escavable overburden is estimated to be 180,825 cubic meters with stripping ratio of 1:6.5.

Indeed we are interested in finding the effect of annealing on the structural and optical properties of the films deposited. To achieve this objectives the mixed composition of NaCl and PbCl2 thin films were deposited using vacuum evaporation techniques. They were subsequently characterized using a combination of X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and UV-visible spectrophotometer for the identification of the elements presents, surface composition/morphology studies and thickness determination.For the optical characterization, absorption spectra in the UV/visible region were analyzed and the band gap energies of the materials were obtained. It was observed that the films showed a phonon assisted transition with an indirect optical band gap energy of 3.02 eV.Moreover, the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed that the films are polycrystalline and upon annealing, a diffusion process takes place with NaCl diffusing into PbCl2. The grain sizes of NaCl and PbCl2 were estimated after deposition as 481 A and 473.9 A, respectively. However, after annealing the films at different temperatures it was found that the grain size of NaCl increase to 577.26 A while that of PbCI2, reduced to 315.93 A, suggesting a grain growth of NaCl at the expense of PbCl2.  The study is significant for understanding the behavior of NaCl/PbCl2 structures used in a variety of applications such as optical window for solar radiation in solar cell.|Theses Collection|Vacuum evaporation techniques/x-ray diffraction/scanning electron microscopy/uv-visible spectrophotometer/morphology/phonon assisted transition/polycrystalline/solar radiation*||||||Oyedijo, Isaac Adesayo|M|The practice of strategic management by Nigerian Banks and its relationship to corporate performance||||||Ph.D. Business Administration|P.E.

The study sought to determine the level of strategic management that is practised among Nigerian banks, the factors that are associated with particular levels of strategic management that are practised and the relationship, if any, between the level of strategic management that is practised and the level of corporate performance. The objectives of the study were achieved through the collection and analysis of primary and secondary data obtained from a sample of 56 banks drawn from the study population.  Strategic management practices were classified into four; namely: low and rudimentary, medium and emerging , high and established,very high and sophisticated. The data obtained were analysed by using descriptive statistics, Chi-square (X2) tests, and correlation and multiple regression techniques.The results obtained showed that the deliberate practice of strategic management is becoming widely accepted among Nigerian banks although the use approach is still low and rudimentary in some banks. The level of strategic management that is practiced among Nigerian banks was found to be directly proportional to the perceived amount of uncertainty, variability, illiberality and instability of the banking operating environment that took place in Nigeria in the and 1980s and1990s. A strong and positive relationship was found between the size, number of branches, asset base and income of a bank and the level of strategic management that is practised by the bank. The greatest impetus for the practice of strategic management was found to have come from the increase in the level of competitive pressure and the rising wave of government regulations.  There was significant positive correlation between the levels of strategic management and corporate performance. For all the financial performance indicators used, performance tended to increase as the level (or degree of sophistication) of strategic management increased. Three components of strategic management, namely: the percentage of a bank's budget that is spent on strategic management functions, the time horizon of a bank's strategic plans and objectives, and the state of a bank's strategic management organization, were found to influence corporate performance more than other strategic management components. Corporate performance tended to increase more with a unit increase in the level of these strategic management components.|Theses Collection|Strategic management/banking operating environment/illiberality and instability/amount of uncertainty/asset base/level of competitive pressure/government regulations/corporate performance/bank's budget/time horizon of a bank's *||||||Oyede, Mutiat Adeola|F|Studies on the cell wall degrading enzyme associated with the deterioration of cassava  (Manihot  Esculenta  Crantz) tubers||||||Ph.D. Microbiology|P.O.

Cassava starch is used in the industrial manufacture of many products.  However, cassava's high perishability has brought about a major constraint in its utilization. The present work was designed to examine the production and role of cell wall degrading enzymes associated with the post harvest deterioration of cassava tuber.Freshly harvested cassava tubers were allowed to deteriorate and the isolation and identification of some moulds were carried out. Afterwards, apparently healthy cassava tuber disks were inoculated with spores of each of the isolated fungi, followed by extraction of enzymes produced during the deterioration. The isolated enzymes were partially purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. Some properties of the enzymes were also examined.Five dominant moulds, isolated from spoilt cassava tubers, were identified as Aspergillus niger, Botryodiplodia theobromae, Fusarium sp, Penicillium variabile and Trichodernaa sp. A. niger, B. theobromae and P. variabile caused the rot of healthy cassava tubers, the most pathogenic being B. theobromae while Fusarium and Trichoderma species did not produce any rot.During the deterioration of cassava tuber disks by A. niger, cellulase and polygalacturonase enzymes were produced.  Extracts from cassava tuberdisks infected with B. theobromae and P. variabile exhibited pectin lyase, cellulase and polygalacturonase activities.     The molecular weights of the enzymes obtained from A. niger, B. theobromae and P. variabile were approximately 115,000, 125,000 and 105,000 daltons respectively. The optimum temperature for the activities of all enzymes produced by the three fungi were 40°C except P. variabile pectin lyase which was 35°C. The highest activity of cellulase from A. niger, B. theobromae and P. variabile occurred at pH 4.0. 4.5 and 4.5 respectively. The polygalacturonase activity of A. niger and P. variabile had an optimum pH of 4.0 while B. theobromae was at pH 5.0. The pectin lyase produced by B. theobromae and P. variabile exhibited optimum activity at pH 8.5 and 8.0 respectively. The activities of all enzymes produced by the three fungi were affected by all concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca++ and Mg++ employed in this study. Certain concentrations were stimulatory while others were inhibitory. All concentrations of EDTA and HgCl2 employed inhibited all enzyme activity and certain concentrations of HgCl2 led to total loss of activity of some enzymes The activities of most of the enzymes increased with increase in substrate concentration. The apparent Km for the hydrolysis of carboxymethyl cellulose by A. niger, B. theobromae and P. variabile cellulases were 5.3, 5.0 and 5.0mg/ml respectively.  The apparent Km for the hydrolysis of pectin by polygalacturonase produced by A. niger, P. variabile and B. theobromae were 5.9, 5.9 and 4.2mg/ml respectively.  The apparent Km of pectin lyase from B. theobromae and P. variabile for the hydrolysis of pectin were  14.7 and 12.5mg/ml respectively.The present work has highlighted the nature and types of cell wall degrading enzymes involved in the  post harvest deterioration of cassava tuber.  The information on some properties of these enzymes could be useful in designing control measures to combat spoilage or reduce the rate of perishability of cassava tubers after harvest.|Theses Collection|Carbohydrate/cell wall degrading enzymes/chromatography/polygalacturonase activity/hydrolysis of carboxymethyl cellulose/Botryodiplodia theobromae/Aspergillus niger/moulds*||||||Oyadiran, Kolawole Emmanuel|M|The tradition and western idioms in Joshua  Uzoigwe's piano compositional works||||||M.A. Music|C.O.

It also examined the attitude of that administration to press freedom during the transition period. This study further sought to profer suggestions, on the basis of the findings, on how the press can help in bringing about and sustaining democracy in Nigeria.To achieve these objectives, the study employed several research methods. First, is the adoption of content analysis of the press coverage of identified issues in the period covered by the study that is 1985 to 1993. Second, is the employment of questionnaire method of data collection. An effective sample size of three hundred and fifty one was chosen. Three hypotheses were tested.The findings show that, generally, the press played negative role in the transition period under study. Its attitude, wittingly or unwittingly, encouraged the military regime's design to prolong its stay. This is because, when the regime took arbitrary actions, such as cancellations and proscriptions which often resulted in postponement of terminal date, the press often supported the government and even helped to rationalize its actions. It should be mentioned though that a section, albeit small section, of the press proved itself critical and independent of government's actions.The findings also show that it was only at the time of the "final annulment" of June 12, 1993 election that the general press played the proper role it ought tohave played in the past. Even then, most government owned media still helped in rationalizing the untenable action. This supports the fact, buttressed by other data in the study that press coverage of issues in the transition period was influenced by partisan consideration of ownership and control of the media.On press freedom, it was found out that the attitude and actions of Babangida's administration were antithetical to press freedom. This impaired the performance of the press during the transition period. The study shows that the Nigerian press needs to appreciate its strategic importance in the society and the strategic responsibilities bestowed on it by the society. It must see itself as the watchdog of government's activities and agencies. It must act impartially, critically and objectively if its relevance to the sustenance of democracy is to be felt. On its part the government should provide an enabling environment for the exercise of press freedom.|Theses Collection|Babangida's administration/press freedom/democracy/military regime's/"final annulment" of June 12, 1993 election/media houses/transition period/watchdog of government's activities and agencies/fundamental humab right    *||||||Sosan, Mosudi  Babatunde|M|Effect of lepidopterous stem borers infestation on the yield of maize (Zea mays  L.||||||M.Phil.

The investigation was based on naturally occurring populations of maize borers in the field. The methods used for assessing stem borer attack include % visible assessment damage (% VAD), % nodes bored (NB), % internodes bored (INB) and, % stem tunnelled (ST). The pest species composition was established by dissection of plants.Infestation by the stern borers complex on maize showed that Sesamia calamistis Hmps was the most predominant borer species at Ile-Ife in both the early and late seasons This was closely followed by Eldana saccharina Wlk whilst Busseola Iusca Fuller that was reported in the past as a major pest of maize in the zone was the least abundant. Sesamia calamistis infested the maize crop early, from five weeks after planting (5 WAP), while E. saccharina and B. fusca infested the crop late in each season, from 9 WAP. Sesamia calamistis and E. saccharina infestations persisted till harvest when some larvae of these species were recovered from the ears. Eldana saccharina was the predominant borer species at harvest. Infestation was higher in late season (16-34%) than the early season (6-11%) The relationship between pairs of parameters for assessment of stem borer attack indicated that the parameters are good indicators of one another for assessing stem borers infestation in maize. The percentage nodes bored gave the highest percent infestation in both seasons than the other parameters. The percent nodes bored was found to be a reliable and accurate method of assessing borer infestation in the field; scoring for infestation was found to be best between 7 and 11 WAP when the activities of these pests are at the peak.The relationship between percentage infestation and yield components (grain yield and 100 grain weight) was variable .The percentage nodes and internodes bored appeared to be more consistent and more reliable parameters for assessing stem borer infestation and grain yield. The linear damage function indicates that yield reduction was proportional to the degree of infestation. For every 1% increase in node and internodes damage, there was a corresponding decrease of 0.66 and 1.14%, respectively, in grain yield of maize.|Theses Collection|Stem borers infestation/downy mildew and streak resistant maize variety/visible assessment damage/larvae/yield components/ percentage infestation/node and internodes damage  *||||||Sarumi, Michael  Debowale|M|The emergence of a democratic South Africa and its implications for Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

In its bid to promote and protect the country's national interests, in it interaction  with the outside world, Africa has become the cornerstone of Nigeria's foreign policy since the attainment of Independence. Nigeria sees this "responsibilility as a function of historical role conferred on it by virtue of having the largest concentration of blacks in the world.This study focuses briefly on the contributions of Nigeria towards the eradication of apartheid in South Africa. During the era of apartheid, its attitude towards South Africa was confrontational and ideological. Now, that posture is gradually giving way to co-operation and accommodation. This is the core of this study that Nigeria has to prepare for a new approach to economic co-operation and integration. Then the basic question is that won't this present trend lead to the struggle for regional leadership in Africa between South Africa and Nigeria.When that does occur, what challenges will South Africa present to Nigeria especially in respect of its (Nigeria) dominance in the Africa socio-economic and political issues on the continent? We realised in this study that on the three key issues that makes a nation powerful like - Politics, Economic and Military or Strategic issues, Nigeria will have to redefine its feet again. The explorations of these challenges are discussed in the light of the New World Order.Finally, the study looks at the emerging scenario and the implications on Nigeria with suggestions on Nigeria's future prospects and policy options towards South Africa.|Theses Collection|International policies/foreign policy/independence/apartheid in South Africa/economic co-operation and integration/New world order*||||||Salawu, Akeem  Segun|M|Iyisodi ninu Eka-Ede Ekiti||||||M.A. Yoruba|Lawrence  Olufemi  Ayodele||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, African Languages and Literatures|1998|||OAU||||This thesis examined the concept of negation in the Ekiti dialect.

Two Stage Least Squares(2SLS) estimation technique was employed to estimate the parameters of our variables for the period 1970-1993.The results of the Stock Market Equation show that financial sector reforms had contributed significantly to Stock Market Development in Nigeria. For the growth equation, Stock Market index indicates a positive and significant association with economic growth.The policy implications of the findings are, first, government should avoid financial repression and lean more towards the side of carefully designed and consistently implemented policy of deregulation since financial reform affects Stock Market development positively. Particular attention should be given to exchange rate and financial structure policies because of their possible destabilizing effects if not well managed. Second, policy makers should endeavour to encourage Stock Market development so as to actualize their vision of sustained and real growth in the future.|Theses Collection|Stock Market Development/financial sector reforms/stock market index/financial repression/deregulation/exchange rate/real growth  *||||||Olaoti, Tajudeen  Ademola|M|An assesment of training and development as instruments for enhancing staff performance in Offa and Oyun local government councils of Kwara State||||||M.Sc.

This study became imperative because, training and development, inspite of the fact that it has over the years been put in place in local government with the fundamental objective of enhancing the performance capabilities of staff, has not practically achieve the purpose for which it was established.   This, simply put, inferred that there is a defect, which this study sought to assess and proffer recommendations.Data used for the study were collected through the use of both primary and secondary sources of data.  The primary data were collected through the use of structured questionnaire survey and oral interviews.  While the secondary data were collected from official documents and relevant library materials.  Simple percentage as well as descriptive and historical techniques were used to analyse, interpret and discuss data generated.From the discussion, the study identified and highlighted among others that, the training and development programmes mostly attended outside the Local Government Councils by the staff as well as the ones organised within the Local Government Councils are not always relevant and appropriate to the present duties of the staff.  In line with this, the study also revealed that the training and development programmes that aimed primarily at enhancing performance are grossly inadequate.The study also found out that there was no effective system of evaluating training and development programmes and, of trainees (staff).  The findings of the study also indicated that there was a great need for other factors such as prompt payment of salary and other emoluments, availability of materials and instruments etc., to be present to aid a well trained staff to perform to his maximum standard possible.Essentially, the study made the following recommendations which, if religiously adhere to could bring about an effective training and development Programme that could lead to the enhancement of performance of local government staff.  These, among others are as follows.  The programme of staff training and development at the local government level should be firmly geared to the achievement of progressive and significant improvements in the standard of performance of local government staff in the delivery of timely services, at an acceptable cost to the local populace.  Accordingly, relevant and appropriate training and development programmes should be provided for the staff regularly.  Training and development programmes must be fully supported by the top management and must be based on recognized needs.Finally, a suitable and effective evaluation system must be put in place.The study will in no small measure, guide the government, public personnel managers and particularly local government practitioners in drawing and implementing training and development policies in the future.|Theses Collection|Training and development policies/suitable and effective evaluation system/delivery of timely services/performance capabilities/*||||||Olaosebikan, Johnson  Sogo|M|Socio-economic and cultural differentials in contraceptive usage among women in Ilorin area of  Kwara State||||||M.Sc.

The study which was mainly based on a secondary source of data had among others the following objectives, namely, to examine the level of contraceptive use, to identify factors affecting the use of contraceptives and to establish the effect of contraceptive use on the fertility of women in the study area.A total of 800 randomly selected married women were interviewed and their responses were subsequently analysed using statistical techniques like, frequency, cross-tabulation and stepwise logistic regression.The findings revealed that the use of contraceptive was low among the sampled married women in the study area. About 21.6 percent of currently married women used contraceptives while 15.5 percent used traditional methods (abstinence, rhythm, withdrawal). The use of family planning was higher among urban women (26.1%) than rural women (6.9%). The total fertility rate (TFR) of the urban and rural areas in Ilorin was surprisingly high. In the former the total fertility rate was 6.53 while in Bode Sadu it was 6.32. The findings also revealed the importance of female education, religion, income and family planning clinic attendance on the use of contraceptives.Based on the findings, the study recommends among other things improvement in the educational status of women, mass education and campaigns to change the culturally accepted norms of women about fertility and their attitudes and orientation with regard to the use of contraceptives should be stepped up. In this regard family planning promotion and products should be taken to the doorsteps of the people and current clients both in the rural and urban areas of Ilorin as it is done in Bangladesh.|Theses Collection|Contraceptive use/fertility of women/abstinence/withdrawal/family planning/fertility rate/religion/female education/culturally accepted norms *||||||Olaniyan, Olanike Fasilat|F|Adoption of improved cassava varieties by women farmers in rural areas of Oke-Ogun, Oyo State||||||M.PHIL.

A total of one-hundred and fifty-five women farmers were randomly selected proportional to the number of women-farmers in each of the selected farming communities in each Local Government Area. Structured interview schedules duly pretested before use were employed in collecting information needed from the respondents. Simple descriptive statistical tools such as frequency count, percentage, mean, bar and pie-charts and graph were made used of in analysing the data collected from the respondents. Appropriate statistical tools such as chi-square, regression analysis, multiple regressions, and correlation analysis were used in testing the null hypotheses set for the study.The results of this study showed significant relationships between adoption of improved cassava varieties and membership of co-operative society, perceived characteristics of the improved cassava varieties, and situational/community factors(decision making at individual level and leadership patterns). Furthermore inter-correlation relationships were found to exist between age and marital status (r =0.215); and number of children assisting them in farm work (r = 0.195); number of children assisting in farm works and membership of co-operative society (r = 0.373); sources of credit and number of children assisting in farm works (r = 0.270); sources of credit and membership of co-operative societies (r=0.675). A significant but negative relationship was found between age and number of years spent in formal schooling and age (r = -0.194); and marital status (r =-0.194). The study also showed that demographic and socio-economic characteristics of women farmers, such number of children assisting in farm work, number of years of ducation. membership ofco-operative societies, sources of credit, income,and sources of acquiring farm land were positively related to their adoption of improved cassava varieties. A very high level of awareness (100%) and adoption (90.3%) of improved cassava varieties was found among the women farmers in the study area.|Theses Collection|Co-operative society/individual level and leadership patterns/demographic and socio-economic characteristics/improved cassava varieties/women farmers *||||||Omoteso, Bonke  Adepeju|F|The relationship between teacher verbal behaviour and teacher effectiveness in secondary schools in Ife central local government area||||||M.A. Psychology of Education|E.R.I.

The thrust of the thesis is that improving productivity and professionalism is anchored on adequate and systematic manpower training and development activities .The study sought to critically assess the current approach with a view to identifying the inherent problems; and to proffer some workable solutions which would facilitate the achievement of the goals of the professionalization policy in the state civil service.Both primary and secondary sources of data collection were employed to carry out the study. The primary data include amongst others, the use of questionnaire, inlet view guides/discussions, and participant observation methods. Secondary data were collected from the library documents such as books, journals, magazines, periodicals news papers etc. Others include data collected from archival materials in the state civil service training schools, documents and records from the various ministries and extra-ministerial departments in the state. The analysis of the data was carried out through the use of theoretical, descriptive and statistical methods.The study discovered that the current approach to manpower training and development programmes in the state civil service is inadequately planned .The situation was occasioned by the apparent lack of information crucial to the identification of training and development needs of staff Rather than needs, the selection of staff and training programmes are solely based on the staff interest .Thus the current approach has failed to facilitate the acquisition of requisite professional knowledge, skills, attitudes, and ethical norms of behaviour for the employees. This position validates our first hypothesis.The study further discovered that the current manpower training and development process is not properly conceived and implemented to achieve professionalism and productivity in the slate civil service This position is apparent from apathetic disposition of staff to intellectual training and development programmes which are capable of achieving and sustaining professionalism and productivity. Our second working hypothesis is therefore validatedIt was observed as well that the training and development activities of the slate civil service are hampered by a number of factors. These include amongst others - lack of detailed scheme of service, unwillingness to acquire relevant educational qualifications, unwillingness to undertake training activities, misdirection of funds to less intellectual training programmes, inadequate trainee evaluation etc To combat these problems, a number of recommendations were made These include - provision of comprehensive scheme of service, availability of conducive atmosphere for training and development activities for all categories of workers in the state civil service Others include proper identification of staff training needs, full involvement of training committees of ministries/Extra- ministerial department in the training process: emphasis on relevant intellectual - oriented training programmes, proper monitoring of funds on relevant training and development programmes, emphasis on the use of external system of evaluation for the trainees etc.|Theses Collection|Productivity and professionalism/archival materials/civil service training schools/lack of information/ethical norms of behaviour/misdirection of funds *||||||Ajetunmobi, Joshua Olusegun|M|Management of price risk and production uncertainty as affected by the income of newly emerging cocoa farmers in south-western Nigeria.||||||Ph.D Agricultural Economics|Owolabi Ajobo||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Agricultural Economics|2002|||OAU|||||xiv,160p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Also, the producer exporters had fewer family size and their farms were not as old as those of producer non-exporters However, they were better off than the producer non-exporters in respect of size of farm, size of harvest, educational status, capital base and access to purchased inputs. The producer-exporters were exporting average of 385 tonnes per annum of cocoa beans but producing just 5.33%.The most pronounced source of production risk for the producer exporters was irregular availability of labour, for producer non exporters it was theft of produce. Most crucial sources of price risk identified by producer exporters were exchange and interest rate fluctuations. Most of the producer non-exporters identified only variability in producer. All the farmers used a mixture of copper sulphate and quicklime to control black pod infection. About 57% of the producer exporters hired night watchmen to safeguard their cocoa beans from thieves; producer non-exporters used other means such as prayer and charm. The producer exporters were more keen on ensuring high quality beans than producer non-exporters. The most widely used strategy for managing fluctuations in producer price by producer non-exporters was trading part of future output for chemicals while producer-exporters engaged in forward contracting with agrochemical companies. Budgeting analysis indicated that the producer exporter had higher returns per hectare (N23,510) than producer non-exporters (N15,380), However, the rate of return to producer non exporters was much higher than that of producer exporters. The nominal protection coefficient (NPC) indicated that the producer exporters were more protected than non-exporters. Autospectral analysis showed that the cocoa output indicated a cycle of 12 months while that of producer price showed no periodic cycle. The cross spectral analysis however shows that the highest coherence is at near seasonal frequencies.  The results of the risk response model were congruent with Constant Relative Risk Aversion behavior stance of the cocoa producers. The elasticities derived from the risk response model showed that a positive change in neither wealth nor spot price would cause an increase in cocoa supply while an increase in producer price will cause a decline.  The optimal hedge ratio using OLS model was 0.89, while it was between 0.31 and 0.58 for mean variance model.

Earlier studies have isolated the economic and non-economic determinants of Strike in developing countries but the impacts of the identified factors have not been estimated. The work attempted to bridge the gaps that exist between the theoretical analysis and empirical analysis.We employed Simultaneous equation model techniques (SEMT) in which Strikes and wage rates are made endogenous. The study specified the operational model as a simultaneous system of equation during log-linear transformation of key variables. The reduced form equation is obtained to access the relative impact of the explanatory variable.Secondary data were obtained from Federal Ministry of Labour, Employment and Productivity, Lagos and Federal Office of Statistics (FOS), Lagos. The results obtained from our investigation confirm our hypothesis that changes in wage rate, price expectation and union membership concentration influence Industrial Strikes in Nigeria. The Simultaneous equation model revealed that wages were significantly affected by Strikes activity.	Strike activities were not affected by wages only during the period in the study.The implication of the study is that the clustering of Strikes after a general wage review is an indication that the government and private sectors employers have not allowed the growth of the labour institutions that would advance the successful implementation of wage policies in Nigeria. We therefore conclude that based on the impact of Strike activities both the employers of labour and trade union should endeavour to manipulate these variables so as to maintain an industrial harmony.|Theses Collection|Industrial Strikes/wage rates/price expectation/union membership/wage review/growth of the labour institutions/government policies/wage policies *||||||Olojede, Iyabo Adefowoke|F|An assessment of the implementation of housing policies and programmes in Lagos State||||||Ph.D. Public Administration|Samuel Bamidele Ayo||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Public Administration|1998|||OAU|||||xii,371p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

As a result, most governments often adopt a number of housing policies and programmes to minimise housing problems. These range from direct provision, site development to mortgage finance. In Nigeria, Federal Government intervened in the housing sector through several policies. These policies among others include the Land Use Act of 1978 and National Housing Policies of 1980 and 1991.In Lagos State, the state government also adopted a number of housing policies and programmes to address the housing situation in the state. The most significant was the Lagos State Housing Policy of 1980. Inspite of these policies and resource commitments both at the Federal and State levels (Lagos State inclusive) many urban dwellers still lack adequate shelter.The study set out to examine the key management problems that obstruct the implementation of housing policies and programmes in Lagos State. It also seeks to establish the extent to which these problems are rooted in the capability of institutions responsible for the implementation of housing policies and programmes.The study discovers that ineffective implementation of government housing policies and programmes is traceable to the low capacity of implementing institutions. Exogenous factors which include political instability and the depressed economic environment were other impeding factors to the successful implementation of housing policies and programmes in Lagos State. In order to make housing services available to the citizens especially the low-income earners, the study suggests the strengthening of the implementing institutions through provision of adequate financial resources, required autonomy and the adoption of personnel administration peculiar to the agencys needs. Finally, in light of the inadequate mechanisms of government for meeting the housing needs of the majority of people, the active participation of the private sector, employers, housing cooperatives, self-help movements and building societies is considered desirable to ensure steady supply of housing. To arrive at these findings and recommendations, both primary and secondary sources of data were used. Primary data were collected from a number of public officials (past and present) in the relevant housing agencies and beneficiaries of public housing. Secondary data were sourced from government publications, official documents/files, annual recurrent and capital estimates, relevant budget speeches of successive Lagos State Governors, books and journals on public administration/housing etc.|Theses Collection|Land use act of 1978/National housing policies of 1980 and 1991/political instability/depressed economic environment/implementing institutions/autonomy  *||||||Omafuvbe, Bridget Okiemute|F|Evaluation of the microbiological and biochemical changes during the fermentation of soybean (Glycine max  (L)  Merrill)  for Soy-Daddawa||||||Ph.D. Microbiology|O.O.

The use of soybean would be enhanced if products acceptable to consumers are produced. This study was designed to investigate the microbiological and biochemical changes in the fermentation of soybean for 'daddawa' (a food condiment) and the ability of pure cultures of isolated microorganisms to ferment sterile soybean. The biochemical and organoleptic components of locust bean (Parkia biglobosa Welw.) and soybean 'daddawa' were also compared.Soybean seeds were fermented using the uncontrolled traditional fermentation method for seventy-two hours during which samples were collected periodically for microbial isolation and identification. Cell suspensions of the isolated microorganisms as single and mixed starter cultures were used to ferment sterile cooked soybean for seventy-two hours. Titratable acidity, pH, moisture content, total free amino acids, soluble and reducing sugars concentrations were estimated in the fermenting samples. In addition, the major extracellular enzyme activities were estimated using standard assay methods.Proximate and mineral compositions of unfermented and fermented cooked locust bean and soybean were estimated. The free amino acids and flatus-forming oligosaccharides were separated by paper chromatography. The individual amino acids were estimated after separation by paper chromatography using the ninhydrin colorimetric method. Organoleptic qualities of the fermented seeds were evaluated by a panel of ten regular 'daddawa' consumers.The results showed that only bacteria species namely Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilus and Bacillus licheniformis were isolated from the fermenting soybean with B subtilis predominating. Protease, Ü- and â-amylases, amyloglucosidase and lipase activities increased with fermentation and attained their peaks between 36 and 48 h. In the pure culture fermentations, only B. subtilis as single or as part of mixed starters gave high activities of the enzymes. B pumilus and B. licheniformis gave low activities of protease and a-amylase, while the other enzymes were not detected. Lipase and sucrase activities were generally low compared to the other enzymes studied. In general, the amount of free amino acids increased, soluble sugars decreased gradually, while reducing sugars increased in the first twelve hours and decreased in the uncontrolled and starter culture fermentations of soybean. However, in the fermentations involving the mixture of B. licheniformis and B. pumilus and all the three Bacillus sp. the soluble sugar fluctuated while reducing sugars increased. The crude protein, fibber, carbohydrate and flatus-forming oligosaccharides decreased while free amino acids, fat and ash increased after the fermentation of locust bean and soybean seeds. Soybean protein content (48.51%) was higher than locust bean protein (42.88%) while locust bean fat (40.19%) was higher than soybean fat (31.46%) after fermentation. In general, the concentrations of individual free amino acids compared favourably, with glutamic acid being the most abundant in the fermented soybean (34.0 mg/g) and locust bean (34.30 mg/g) seeds.The data obtained suggest that B. subtilis is the most important microorganism in the fermentation of soybean for 'daddawa'. The fermentation resulted in significant reduction of flatus-forming oligosaccharide level and increased soluble products notably free amino acids.|Theses Collection|Organoleptic components/extracellular enzyme activities/flatus-forming oligosaccharide level/chromatography/ninhydrin colorimetric method*||||||Onime, Clement Ehimika|M|Development of a computer internetworking scheme for the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife||||||M.Sc.

Two types of internetworking schemes were considered. The International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) Academic Computer Network node at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) was also considered and three separate Local Area Networks existing in the University (the computer science building, technology building and sciences building) are inter-networked to the ICTP Academic Computer node.

The objectives were to examine various regulations protecting the urban tenants in the study area and to assess the level of awareness of the tenants to some components of housing rights.Questionnaires were administered on a random sample of 300 tenants in the study area. The questionnaires addressed issues of respondents' personal characteristics, level of awareness of rental housing regulations, and level of satisfaction of tenants with some components of housing rights. The data collected were analysed using frequency tables, and bar charts.The study revealed that although the 1978 Rent Control Edict was put in place to protect the rights of tenants on some fundamental components of housing rights such as prevention from forceful ejection, arbitrary rent increase, unapproved change of use, yet the mechanism that could make the edict operational was never put in place. The findings further established that majority of the tenants could not afford to pay their rent.The study recommends that government should intervene in the provision and management of public rental housing. Rent Control Law should be resuscitated and strengthened to protect the rights of tenants. In this regard, new Rent Control Board with representatives of tenants, Landlords and professional bodies in the building industry should be established. Legal remedies such as repairs and deduct laws and receivership laws should be incorporated into the Rent Control Law. The functions of building inspectors and Local Planning Authorities should be strengthened to include the inspection of existing housing facilities.|Theses Collection|Housing regulations/satisfaction of tenants/housing rights/rent control edict/forceful ejection/rent control board*||||||Olimma, Joseph  Francis|M|Well log-seismic sequence stratigraphy interpretation in central oml 35 of the Niger Delta||||||M.Sc.

The data used include well logs (Gamma- Ray, Spontaneous Potential and Resistivity), biofacies and seismic data. The main hydrocarbon-bearing structures found in the study area are the dip - hanging wall closure, characterized by shifts in crestal axis with depth and the collapsed crest structure.Environmental diagnosis based on faunal abundance/diversities, well log shape and mineralogical data shows coastal deltaic (transitional) to shallow marine depositional units, with characteristic transgressive holomarine shales succeeding the landward sequences cyclically. Four cycles (cycles 6, 7, 8 and 9) of the eleven discrete cycles occurring in the Niger Delta were recognized. Isochronous surfaces, determined with the aid of the Niger Deltaholomarine shales  and identified by characteristic markers   - 3  -(12.8  and Dodo Shale (11.5 Ma).Systems tracts interpretation based on log shapes and biofacies data indicate the presence of lowstand prograding complex, transgressive systems tracts and the highstand systems tracts. Seismic stratigraphy interpretation reveals seven major faults and a deep-seated antithetic fault. The integration of well log data into seismic section is achieved using Time-depth (TZ) conversion data.Seismic facies analysis shows parallel and sub-parallel reflection patterns, gently divergent and slight progradational configurations. There are six seismic facies (A - F) across the study area. These facies units grade from variable amplitude, frequency and poor to fair reflection configuration of the Benin Formation, to the parallel to oblique and high reflection continuity -within the Agbada Formation. Hydrocarbon distribution in the study area presented graphically by the bar and pie charts shows the transgressive systems tract to contain appreciable amounts of oil and gas, while the lowstand systems tracts contain minimal oil and gas accumulation. The highstand systems tracts, although associated with the least accountable proportion of oil, have a fairly high gas proportion.Sediment burial, thermal history and hydrocarbon maturity modelling of the well Galisoma-1 shows that the present day top of oil window (VRE = 0.6%) is reached at average depth of 13123ft (4000m). The modelling confirmed the Galisoma area as an oil field since the gas - oil ratio is less than 1000.Well log-seismic sequence stratigraphy involving the integration of the results of well logs, biofacies and seismic data, applied in this study has been able to show the hydrocarbons potential of the early channel transgressive systems tracts, containing 62% oil and 35% gas, and the deep seated sands of the lowstand systems tracts, having 27% oil and 34% gas, as against the highstand systems tracts which contain 11% oil and 31% gas.|Theses Collection|Oil fields/depositional sequences/lithofacies/hydrocarbon/biofacies/crest structure/faunal abundance/mineralogical/holomarine shales/isochronous surfaces/Galisoma-1 *||||||Olapade, Kehinde  Akintayo|M|Statistical models for analysing criminal behaviours||||||M.Sc.

Though crime may or may not pay, but studying it does. This is because crime brought anxiety, anger and fear as some of the common responses to crime. For these reasons effort is always on to reduce it.In this thesis, we look at the criminal behaviours of people from statistical point of view. We formulate statistical models that could be used to analyse criminal behaviours. We find out what are the personal attributes of some people that make them to take to crimes. This lead us to suggest ways of controlling crime.We started with the review of some basic literature in criminology like Hagan [20], Conklin [10], Denis [161, Oloruntimehin [30] etc. Some statistical texts like Cox [11], Draper [18], Finney [19], Lawless [23], Johnson [22], Ojo [29] etc which are the bedrock of the statistical analysis in this thesis were also reviewed.By using linear multiple regression model and logistic regression model, we formulated statistical models that could be used to control crimes. Furthermore, we discriminated between linear multiple regression model and logistic regression model and pointed out the reasons why logistic regression is preferred to linear multiple regression model for analysing criminal behaviour data.Also, we bridged the gab between logistic regression and linear multiple regression by obtaining an approximation of the maximum likelihood solution of the logistic regression by the least square solution of the linear multiple regression.Included in this thesis is the proposition of two models that could be used for analysing the rate of committing crime of a criminal.We use the data collected to illustrate the models.|Theses Collection|Social problems/criminology/crime rate/social injustice*||||||Olaniran, Ademola  Olufolahan|M|Studies on bacterial dehalogenation of some organochlorides||||||M.Sc.

The extensive use of these compounds has generally resulted in serious pollution of the environment as they are not usually readily degraded in nature. Thus, they can be detected in significant concentrations in the marine and other aquatic environments, several kilometers from the sites of application. Microorganisms have major and significant roles in the eventual removal of many biodegradable pollutants from the environment. The objectives of this work, therefore, were set to screen for and isolate from the environment, bacterial species capable of degrading organochlorides; to monitor the efficiency of the isolates in the degradation process using chloride ion (Cl-) release as an index of degradation; to characterize and identify the bacterial isolates involved in the degradation process(es) and to evaluate dehalogenase activity of the cell-free culture extracts of the isolates.Six strains of bacteria capable of dehalogenating the four organochlorides tested - Monochloroacetic acid (MCA), trichloroacetic acid (TCA), trichloromethane (CHCl3), and tetrachloromethane (CCl4) were isolated from the soil, sewage and refuse dump samples, and were tentatively identified using standard cultural, morphological, biochemical and microbiological techniques. The isolates were identified as Bacillus, Corynebacterium and Pseudomonas species. The patterns of growth of the isolates as well as the chloride release from the different organochlorides were monitored. The effect of adaptation by serial cultivation on the biodegradation potential was assessed for the different generations obtained. All the compounds, including the glucose control, were utilized as the main carbon and energy sources up to a final substrate concentration of 0.I% (w/v), beyond which they exhibited strong bactericidal effect. Of the organochlorides, CHCl3 was the most and TCA the least utilized for biomass production. The mean generation time of the isolates followed the order: glucose < CHCl3 < MCA < CCl4 < TCA while the peak growth was between 6 h and 12 h. The growth patterns were monophasic and the release of chloride in the batch culture was diphasic.The maximum dehalogenase specific activities (µg/ml chloride release per mg protein per hour) in the actively growing cell cultures ranged from 0.06-0.20 for MCA, 0.31-0.96 for TCA, 0.10-0.26 for CHCl3, and 0.15-0.47 for CCl4. In the cell-free systems involving the culture extracts, the dehalogenase specific activity ranged between 0.05-0.16 for MCA, 0.30-0.80 for TCA, 0.09-0.22 for CHCI3, and 0.13-0.45 for CCI4. A single dehalogenase enzyme band was detected in the culture system of all the isolates in the polyacrylamide gel profile. Considering the relative mobilities of the bands, two types were observed; the one of lower apparent molecular weight in four isolates and the other in two isolates. The pH optima for the dehalogenase specific activities were between 7.6 and 8.0 while the temperature optima were between 30°C and 35°C. The enzymes were inducible and the serial adaptation of the isolates steadily evolved strains which exhibited higher and significantly different metabolization rate of the organochlorides for biomass production compared to the original starting strain.The results obtained in this study demonstrated clearly that the isolates have the potential to degrade and assimilate organochloride pesticides. Under suitable and optimal conditions which are subject of further studies from this work, it is conceivable that the cell-free extracts from these organisms may be applicable for biological treatment of effluent discharges from organochloride-based industries, or in situ application in bioremediation process of contaminated water or soil, in a controlled manner.|Theses Collection|Organochlorides/pollution/biodegradable pollutants/glucose/monophasic/polyacrylamide gel profile/metabolization rate/bioremediation/trichloroacetic acid/Corynebacterium *||||||Oluwade, Bamidele  Ayodeji|M|Qualitative equivalence of autonomous ordinary differential equations||||||M.Sc.

The study of the role of men in family planning arose from the recognition that without male involvement in reproductive issues, the goals of the national population policy may be unattainable.The study which was mainly based on a primary source of data had among others the following objectives, namely, to examine the role of men's sexuality, knowledge, attitude and practice of family planning methods on contraceptive use by couples, to investigate the various socio-economic/demographic characteristics of men that influence their sexuality, knowlegde, attitude and practice of family planning methods and to examine gender power relations in reproductive health decision making process.A total of 200 and 100 randomly selected male and female respectively were interviewed and their responses were subsequently analysed using statistical techniques like, frequency, cross-tabulation and logistic regression.The findings revealed that respondents in Ibadan are quite well informed about methods of contraception. The best known methods are condom and pills. It was found that despite widespread of knowledge, less than one half of the total population had ever use contraceptives.Majority of respondents who are not using contraceptive methods are not doing so because they want more children. It was also revealed that most fertility decisions like number of children, when to have sex and the use of contraception are being made by men in the study area.Domestic issues like children's welfare, children's schooling, and financial matters attracted more interspousal communication than reproductive matters; but there is greater tendency for women to discuss with their spouse about contraceptive use than for male.The bivariate analysis reveals that among men, education, interspousal communication on both reproductive and no-reproductive matters, attitude towards contraception; fertility decision by husband and knowledge of STDs are associated with higher probabilities of contraceptive use. Regarding contraceptive use by education, the study found positive relationship for men and "n" shape for women. Moreso, men who have fewer numbers of children are more likely to use contraceptive than their female counterparts.The multivariate analysis found significant relationship between current use of methods and education, attitude towards contraception, children ever born, fertility decision by husband and interspousal communication on timing of pregnancy and on contraception among men in the study area. For women, education, children ever born, attitude towards contraception, interspousal communication on contraceptive use and fertility decision by the husband are found to be significantly related to current use of contraceptives by this study. Finally, the study has shown that male partner may be able to play a considerable role in the reduction of excess fertility in Nigeria.Based on the findings, the study recommends among other things improvement in demographic and health education programmes to bring to the consciousness of men the import of small family size and monogamous family type.This should incorporate men from all socio-economic levels, motivation of men to use or allow their wives to use contraceptives, campaigns to improve or change the culturally dominance of men at home, and change attitudes and orientation of men towards contraception.|Theses Collection|National population policy/contraceptive use/family planning/fertility/interspousal communication*||||||Omidire, Felix  Ayoh|M|''Une analyse syethetique de la trilogie de ''Romans de Combat'' de pepetela a la lumiere de la theorie litteraire de frantz fanon''  A synthetic analysis of the Pepetelan trilogy of '' combat novels'' in the light of Frantz.||||||M.A. Foreign Languages|O. Oladitan//E.A. Omoteso||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Foreign Languages|1999|||OAU||||For any given writer, being committed always implies taking sides ideologically with the oppressed. This notion of commitment is particularly true of the writings of most Third-World writers in the latter part of the 20th century when the wars of independence were being fought all over the African continent. However, some of the writers of this era were disposed to take this commitment only to the limits of fictional aesthetics, never intending to risk their necks in the event of real colonial war. For this type of writers, it more than suffices for the committed writer to live his revolution "through third parties". That way, whenever trouble breaks out in the colony, he can duck out of sight. However, for Frantz Fanon, the Martinique-born naturalized-Algerian psychiatrist turned freedom fighter, and the Angolan writer/sociologist  Artur Carlos Mauricio Pestana dos Santos known to his contemporaries under the war name (later pen name) Pepetela, being committed implies being ready to go all the way, being absolutely on the side of the people all through the liberation struggle. For the two writers, writing the "revolutionary anthem" for the people, and living the real revolution with this very people must form part of the same script, as it has been stipulated by Sekou Toure.Fanon in his theoretical masterpiece -The Wretched of the Earth (1961) and Pepetela in his three novels  Muana Puo (1978), As Aventura de Nuunga (1972) and Mayombe (1982) - have shown their respective audiences how best to harness all the efforts of the oppressed to break the yoke of oppression.  In this study, we have undertaken a synthetic analysis of the art of Pepetela in the above mentioned novels which form a trilogy that we have classified "The pepetelan trilogy of combat novels". To this end, we have used the guidelines that Fanon stipulated in his theory revolutionary literature to analyse the said works of Pepetela, in an effort to determine how well the said works fit into the moment-by-moment adaptation of literary art to the need of the colonized nation as stipulated by Fanon.In addition to this, we have tried to evaluate the level of each writer's adherence to the marxist conception of art. In our conclusion, we have pointed out the fact that the influences and the originality that are evidenced in the art of both writers are clear indications that both Fanon and Pepetela are not only authentic voices of their respective people's yearnings for anew existence but also successful executioners of the Sekou-tourean concept of the unity of thought and action that must characterise the work of any committed colonised .|viii,105p|||||||French||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The research benefited immensely from existing data and critical works on oral literature, especially 'Oriki'. The work adopted a sociological framework for an in-depth analysis of the taboos identified in Yoruba Oriki.Our research findings established that taboos are found in Oriki orile (lineage Oriki), Oriki Ilu (town oriki) and Oriki  Orisa (deity Oriki). The research also identified two types of negators: the direct and indirect negators, used by artistes in introducing taboos into the body of Yoruba Oriki..These taboos were classified into taboos that prohibit an action and those that enforce that something should be done. Based on these classifications, the thesis identified many taboos in Yoruba praise and descriptive poetry. We also sought for the sources of the taboos and stories related to these taboos through oral interviews of our informants.

The study also ascertained the differential performance of male and female students. It further investigated the effects of students scoring ability level on students' achievement in the theory of evolution when TCCMIS and STCCMIS were respectively used.The quasi-experimental research design was used for the study. The pre-test, post-test, non-equivalent and non-randomized control group involving a 3x3x2 factorial design was adopted. A total of two hundred and seventy students in the Senior Secondary School Class II were randomly selected and used as respondents in the study from nine schools in Osun State.	Evolution Test items (ETI) and Treatment Packages were used to gather data. The data obtained for the study were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Chi-Square statistical techniques as appropriate. The study hypotheses were tested at 0.05 level of significance.The results from the study showed that STCCMIS significantly improved students' achievement better than the TCCMIS, while the TCCMIS also significantly improved students'achievement better than EIS-Expository Instructional Strategy (Control Group). The result also revealed that students held many pre-conceptions related to evolution and some still persisted after instruction and that STCCMIS (used for Experimental Group B) was the most effective in eliminating students' pre-instructional misconceptions.	There were no sex influences on students' achievement when concept-mapping instructional strategies were used for instruction. There were no significant differences among the high, average and low scorers in biology that were taught evolution using STCCMIS, revealing that at any scoring level in biology the students can learn meaningfully when STCCMIS is used for biology instructions.|Theses Collection|Teacher-centred concept mapping instructional strategy/student/teacher-centred concept mapping instructional strategy/evolution test items/expository instructional strategy  *||||||Rauf, kamilu|M|Some results on weighted norm inequalities of a certain class of integral operators||||||M.Sc.

The Digester Screw Press(DSP) system recently developed by the Nigerian Institute for Oil-Palm Research (NIFOR) to tackle the problem is one good example. Though the DSP shows good promise from the conceptual design point of view, there are some problems which impair its effective operation and adoption. No serious study hat been conducted to identify these bottlenecks and fully evaluate its performance. Consequently, this study was aimed at evaluating the performance of the DSP system in the oil palm fruit processing business, in comparison with the hand operated hydraulic press system.The DSP machine was evaluated using a 23 factorial experimental design after screening the experimental factors. The factors considered were fruit sterilization time, screw press speed and the screw press choke opening. The crude oil produced at the different factors combination was assessed for its solid impurities (non-fat solid content), moisture content and oil content. The sample with the highest oil content (78.6%), lowest solid impurity (9.3%) and fibre oil content (11.5%), obtained from fruit sterilization time, screw speed and choke opening of 11/2hrs, 20 rpm and 25mm respectively was identified as the best. Subsequently, comparison was made (using this factor level combination of the DSP) between the DSP and the hand operated hydraulic press system.The results indicate that the throughput of the DSP system quadrupled that of the hydraulic press system. The extraction efficiency of the DSP (89.1%) was also found to be higher than that of the hydraulic system (78.6%). There was no significant difference between the palm oil quality parameters of the two systems. However the economic analysis indicates that at throughput levels of 0.75 t/h and above, the DSP system is more economical than the hydraulic system in terms of equipment, labour, material and floor pace requirement and the revenue accruing from the processing operation.Modification of the DSP suggested for its improved performance in terms of throughout, oil yield and quality include increase in the length of screw press worm and provision of  a seive spanning the full length of the worm.|Theses Collection|Mechanize digestion/oil separation operations/Nigerian Institute for Oil-Palm Research/digester screw press/fibre oil content/hydraulic press system*||||||Sani, Habibu  Angulu|M|A study of the growth pattern of the Nigerian Federal Civil Service 1960-1993||||||Ph.D. Public Administration|O.M.

Both primary and secondary sources of data collection were utilized to generate information for the study. Primary data were collected through structured and unstructured questionnaires while secondary data were derived from archival and library sources.The findings of the study revealed that the size, costs and growth of the Nigerian Federal Civil Service have been largely influenced by ethno-regional political competition, political patronage and financial resources availability. In addition, the study revealed that contrary to the widely held official view, the Federal Civil Service is not bloated in size; rather it is understaffed and is thinly spread on the ground. The apparent bloated size of the Federal Civil Service is due in the main to the existence of numerous ghost workers.In view of the above, and since existing organization theories have not shed adequate light on civil service size, growth and cost of operations, the study proposed a formula designed towards evolving a theory for determining the optimum size of the Federal Civil Service in Nigeria.|Theses Collection|Optimum size/federal civil service/politics/ghost worker/ethnicity/understaffed/over bloated*||||||Torimiro, Dixon  Olutade|M|Factors associated with youth participation in rural leadership development activities in Ogun State, Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Agricultural Extension & Rural Sociology|E.A.

It specifically identified the personal and socio-economic characteristics of the rural youth participating in R.L.D.As., determined the level of participation of rural youth in R.L.D.As., the congruency between their role perception and role performance, the level of satisfaction derived when participating in R.L.D.As. and the motivational factors for their participation in R.L.D.As. and; it also identified the constraints to their participation in R.L.D.As.Pre-tested and structured interview schedule was used to elicit information from five hundred and fifty-eight (558) rural youth between the age group of 13 and 30 years that were randomly selected, using multi-stage and random sampling techniques, while unstructured interview was conducted with some community elders in the study area to validate some of the responses descriptive statistical techniques like frequency counts and percentage wore used to analyse the data. Pearson's correlation analysis and Spearman's rho rank correlation analysis were used to determine the relationship between the variables investigated in the study. Principal component analysis was also used to ascertain some variables in naming some factors.The results showed that majority of the rural youths were in the age group of 13 and 24 years, and were males and females who can speak their local dialect and Yoruba language very eloquently. Majority of the youth were still unmarried, depended on their parents for accommodation, feeding and clothing; they were fairly-well educated and highly exposed to events outside their communities. Majority of the youth have lived in the community for over 10 years and belonged to rural community associations, they were also unemployed and those who were employed earned low incomes. The study also revealed that very low percentages (between 6.09% and 21.68%) participated in rural leadership development activities such as: decision-making process, resource(s) donation, planning of rural programmes, etc.It was further revealed that there is a highly significant relationship between the level of satisfaction derived when participating in R.L.D.As. and their level of participation with correlation co-efficient, r == 0.8073. Also, variables such as age (r = 0.1479), educational level (r = 0.6873), religion (r = 0.4028), marital status (r = 0.4967), cosmopoliteness (r = 0.5768), length of residence, membership of association (r = 0.2292), attitudes toward R.L.D.As. (r = 0.5625) and income (r = 0.6292) had positive and significant relationship with the level of participation in R.L.D.As. It also revealed congruenybetween their role perception and role performance.The study also showed that the personal interest, family value, recognition, responsibility, incentives derived and economic status were significant motivational factors for youth participation in R.L.D.As. with the following correlation co-efficient: r = 0.2358; r 0.2285; r = 0.2501; r = 0.1935; r = 0.1952 and r = 0.1303 respectively.

Two of the English proverbs and seven of the Igbo proverbs did not however, carry blatant denigrating analogies of their implied messages. While two Igbo proverbs indicated that women are less than human (i.e. that they are like towel and footmat), one posited that a bad woman is worse than an old bicycle. Twenty-nine English proverbs and ten Igbo ones claimed that women are as defective as the things to which they are compared. Five English proverbs and four Igbo ones believed that women are untrustworthy and unreliable. One English and one Igbo proverb claimed jointly that women impoverish those addicted to them.

The aim was to reveal the importance of non-verbal forms in African drama and also to prove the distinctiveness of African aesthetic concepts from the Greco-Roman tradition as postulated by Aristotle.To this end, an examination of dance kinesics in the works of some selected African playwrights was attempted. The analysis necessarily proceeds from the kinesic to the thematic, so that the dance becomes an ostensive vehicle for both meaning and aesthetic dimensions.In addition, the common allegiance to the traditional motif of dance by the widely selected playwrights reveals a common heritage in the use of non-verbal forms in communication.Finally, by proving its versatility within differing dramatic demands, dance kinesics provides unlimited scope for research in African drama.|Theses Collection|Non-verbal communication/aesthetic/kinesics/thematic/African drama/dance motif/dance kinesics*||||||Ayandiran, Emmanuel  Olufemi|M|Factors influencing compliance with medical regimen among chronic renal failure patients in Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

It particularly examined the effect of religion, health belief, educational status, patients' perception of illness, financial status and family support on compliance with medical regimen.A structured interview guide adapted from three instruments used in previous studies on compliance with therapeutic regimen among renal and hypertensive patients was the major tool used for the study. The adapted version was tested for validity and reliability with a correlation coefficient of 0.73 before being used to elicit responses from 32 CRF patients. The patients' case file and results of biochemical parameters were also studied for clinical evidence of compliance. Data collection took 28 weeks. Data collected were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics.The study revealed that religion (x = 0.46), health beliefs (x = 0.41), and financial status (p>0.05) were not significantly associated with compliance among CRF patients in this environment. It was however discovered that the higher the literacy level, the lower the tendency for compliance with medical regimen. It was also found that patient's perception of their illness is positively related to compliance among the CRF patients interviewed.  Furthermore, the study has shown that the family plays a crucial role in promoting and sustaining adherence with medical regimen amon CRF patients.|Theses Collection|Therapeutic/biochemical/chronic renal failure/literacy/medical regimen/hypertensive patients/literacy level/health beliefs*||||||Ayuk, Michael  Ayuk|M|Interpretation of seismic reflection data over Utonana field, Niger Delta||||||M.Sc.

These horizons divide the study area into four layers. Faults (F1 and F2) are regional growth faults and F3 is a secondary antithetic fault. 'These faults constitute the macrostructure upon which Utonana field was founded. The first layer thickness extends from ground surface to a depth of 1448m and possesses an average velocity of 2050m/s. The second layer lies at a depth interval o f 1448m to 1844w with an average velocity of 2650m/s. Layer 3 is 738w thick with an average velocity of 3200m/s. The fourth layer extends to the basement and possesses poor seismic resolution. Layer 1 is the Benin Formation, layers 2 and 3 constitute the Agbada Formation and layer 4 represents both Agbada and Akata Formations.The isochron maps of the seismic horizons show that the dominant structure in the area is a faulted anticline. The normal reflectivity coefficient (R`) of these seismic markers range from 0.02 to 0.22, while the hydrocarbon bearing zones possess values of 0.04 to 0.14. Similarly integrated reflection coefficient (W `n) is high with magnitudes of 0.08 to 0.28. The oil producing zone has integrated reflection coefficient of 0.14 to 0.22. The isovelocity and reflection coefficient maps were used to describe the velocity distribution and also to delimit the hydrocarbon zones in the area.Qualitative interpretation of lithologic logs (gamma ray, self potential) and laterolog revealed four hydrocabon bearing sands in well 1 and seven iii well 4. These sands have been designated A1, A2, A3 and A4 (well 1) and B1, B2, B3, B4, B5,B6 and B, (well 4) .A, sand lies at a subsea depth of 1969w and is a reservoir consisting of oil and water. The oil-water contact is at a depth of 1990m. A2 is found at a depth of 2067m. It is capped at the top and bottom by shale layers. A3 is similar to A, sand with an oil-water contact depth of 2127m. A, is similar to A2. sand. It is capped at the top and bottom by shale layers. B, sand is located at a depth of 1631 m. It is a reservoir with an apparent oil-water contact depth of 1646m. B2, sand is similar to B1, reservoir sand with an oil-water contact depth of 2020m. It is located at a depth of 2000m. B, sand is sealed at the top and bottom by shale layers. It is found at a depth of 2225m. B, is similar to 13, reservoir sand with an oil-water contact depth of 2292m. It is situated at a depth of 2277m 13, is similar to B, reservoir and situated at a depth of 2400m B6, is located at a depth of 2437m and interbedded between shale layers.

Three methods of data collection were employed. The first was the use of multiple-choice questionnaires designed to collect information from professionals involved in pricing preliminaries items either directly or indirectly. The second was the production of bill of quantities for four- bedroom bungalow priced by contractors registered with Oyo and Osun States government under category C and the third method was the collection of cost information on eight different types of building projects.The data obtained were analysed using simple percentages, mean values, linear regression and statistical test of hypothesis. The results of the analyses revealed that only twenty-six out of sixty-one preliminaries items employed in the Nigerian construction industry were usually priced and that only five of them were cost-significant. The results also showed that the cost of preliminaries was on the average 9.84%  of total construction cost and that there was an inverse relationship between cost of preliminaries and total construction cost. It was further revealed that the cost of preliminaries items has been on the increase from 1990 to 1997.The study recommended that estimators should concentrate more on the pricing of cost-significant preliminaries items when preparing their estimates and pay less attention to items that are not cost-significant. It also recommended that the cost implications of items that are time-related and/or cost-related should be considered before granting extension of time and before increasing the volume of construction works.|Theses Collection|Bill of quantities/Nigerian construction industry/cost of preliminaries/total construction cost/pricing/construction works*||||||Babalola, Emmanuel Taiwo|M|The misuse of the auxiliary verbs in the written English texts of senior secondary schools two students in three local government areas of Oyo State, Nigeria||||||M.A. English|S.A.

The specific aims of the study are to identify the various ways by which Senior Secondary School II students of the Ibadan urban centre of Oyo State misuse the English auxiliary verbs in their written texts, and to make suggestions towards the improvement of the use of the auxiliary verbs by the target audience.Consequently, Purposive Random Sampling (PRS) technique was used to select ten schools within three Local Government Areas of Oyo State. Five hundred (500) subjects were thereafter drawn from the schools. The subjects were given two essay topics on which to write on only one of their choice. Their scripts were thereafter examined for any auxiliary-related errors which were then identified, classified and analysed through the use of  Script-Distribution Percentage of each Error (SDPE).It was found out from the findings of the study that the learners demonstrated a lack of understanding of the meanings and functions of the auxiliary verbs most especially the modal auxiliaries. This led them to improper and indiscriminate use of the modals. It also limits the range of functions they use each of the known modal forms to express.Moreover, it was found out that the subjects still need to be tutored on some basic grammatical concepts like tense, concord and plurality. Their inability to understand these concepts limits their usage and even hinders their correct use of most auxiliary verbs which are majorly tense and time reflectors in English utterances.  It was consequently recommended that those people being trained to become teachers of English Language in our Secondary Schools should be exposed to more grammar courses to enable them to become well equipped for English teaching before going out to impart knowledge to Nigerian Secondary School students|Theses Collection|Auxiliary verbs/purposive random sampling/script-distribution percentage of each error/rule of concord/*||||||Ariyibi, Emmanuel  Abiodun|M|Magnetotelluric studies of the middle Benue trough||||||M.Sc.

Therefore, this level of government with considerable access to the nation's wealth should appropriate value for the management of resources.Several reforms were carried out at the local governments level to enhance the social service delivery capabilities of local government and  their capacity to make meaningful contribution to socio-economic transformation at the grassroots level. Specifically, that was the main reason for the 1976 local government reform and even subsequent reforms. The reforms were also to sharpen the resource management capabilities of the local governments.Unfortunately, however, local governments in Nigeria have not been able to perform very well in the management of existing resources and promotion of socio-economic development of their localities despite the relative increase in the financial resources at their disposal.The question is why are local governments very poor in resource management? This is the central question that this study examines. It also focuses attention on how local governments could improve on their   contribution to socio-economic development. Ibadan North-East and North local governments in Oyo state are chosen as case study. Primary and secondary sources of data collected were employed in the study.The findings of the study support the need for popular participation of the people in the management and enhanced socio-economic development at the local level. It was evident that the two councils had not intensified efforts in mobilising the masses to take part in self-help projects The number of self-help projects are few. As a result of this, the two councils has a lot to do in this area for improved socio-economic development|Theses Collection|Resource endowment/social service delivery/resource management/mobilising the masses/local government reform of 1976*||||||Aladenola, Victor  Olufemi|M|Assessment of the ecological status of forest reserves and community managed high forest in Idanre local government area, Ondo State, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The objectives of the study were to assess the floristic and structural properties of forest under institutionalized management and those under community management; to determine the floristic bio-diversity and the status of soil properties of forest under both management schemes.The methodology employed was the measurement of vegetation parameters and laboratory analysis of soil samples collected from both sites at depths of 0-15cm and 15-30cm corresponding to the topsoil and subsoil respectively. Data generated were subjected to statistical analysis while the ecological groupings of species in each site were determined using ordination technique with the aid of Principal Component Analysis (PCA).The result of the study revealed that all the vegetation parameters in government managed forest with the exception of foliage cover, height of emergent layer, species richness and Simpson's species diversity were significantly higher than those of the community managed forest. The forest of the two sites showed an index of similarity of 62.4 percent. Ordination by PCA showed the existence of vegetal degradation and clustering pattern of species in both sites. Six clusters corresponding to one ecological group of forest species were shown in government managed forest while 33% of the clusters in community managed forest were ecotonal communities (containing a mixture of savanna and forest species). The savanna species are however not expected to portend serious ecological problems to forest species in community managed forest due to the obstacles which the forest environment pose to their regeneration potentials. Topsoil analysis indicated that organic matter, available phosphorus and moisture content in government managed forest were significantly different from that of community managed forest. No significant difference was observed for waterholding capacity, total Nitrogen and pH. The subsoil variables follow the trend of the topsoil variables. The organic matter, available phosphorus and moisture content in government managed forest were all significantly different from that of community managed forest. Due to the superior status of soil and vegetal (biomass and structure) indices in government managed forest and an higher species richness in community managed forest, coupled with the high index of similarity of the forests in both sites, a blend of government management tools and indigenous knowledge is thus recommended for the maintenance of the pristine characteristics of the forest of Idanre Local Government.|Theses Collection|Floristic bio-diversity/vegetation/principal component analysis/foliage cover/topsoil/pH value/pristine/biomass/forest reserves*||||||Akpan, Theresa  Benedict|F|Some histological and histochemical studies of the effects of ingestion of chloroquine on the lateral geniculate body and the superior colliculus of adult wistar rats||||||Ph.D. Anatomy|E.A.

The present study was to assess the effects of ingestion of Chloroquine on the microanatomy, some macromolecules such as Nissl Substances, myelin, lipid, glycogen, DNA, RNA and some enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism namely lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH), succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) in these relay centres.Adults male and female wistar rats (120) weighing 200 g averagely, were randomly assigned into treatment (100) and control (20) groups. The rats in the treatment groups received 2 mg /kg body weight of chloroquine phosphate dissolved in distilled water daily for 13 days. The control rats received equal volume of distilled water. The rats were sacrificed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13. The superior colliculus and the lateral geniculate body were carefully dissected out and fixed in 10 % buffered formalin for histological or quickly frozen for lipid, enzyme histochemical and biochemical procedures.The histological findings indicate that the 9th to 13'h day treatment groups in both tissues showed degenerative cells, vacuolation and reduced cellular density. Neuronal density reduced significantly (P < 0.05), neuronal diameter also reduced but this was not statistically significant in both tissues (P > 0.05). In the 7th to 13th day treatment groups, Nissl Substances stained less intensely and appeared degenerative. Myelin appeared faintly stained, swollen with vacuolations in both tissues. The 13th day treatment group of superior colliculus stained intensely for glycogen, whereas the lateral geniculate body increased in the treatment groups. The histochemical staining intensities of LDH, SDH and G-6-PDH decreased in the treatment groups of the lateral geniculate body. In the superior colliculus, the staining intensity of LDH in the control and treatment groups was similar but the SDH and G-6-PDH activities decreased in the treatment groups. However, the biochemical estimations in both tissues indicated a decrease in the activities of LDH, SDH and G-6-PDH in the treatment groups. The biochemical estimations of total nucleic acid, DNA and RNA values decreased in the treatment groups of both tissues. These findings indicate that chloroquine ingestion has deleterious effects on the microanatomy, macromolecules as well as some enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism investigated. Chloroquine may have adverse effects on visual sensibilities by its deleterious effects on the superior collicullus and lateral geniculate body of adult wistar rats.|Theses Collection|Chloroquine/prophylaxis/microanatomy/Nissl Substances/vacuolation/Myelin/Neuronal density/metabolism/biochemical*||||||Esikot, Idorenyin  Francis|M|A critique of ethical naturalism with special reference to Thomas  Hobbes||||||M.A. Philosophy|Moses Oke||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Philosophy|1999|||OAU|||||ix,92p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The thesis found that the overall weakness of Hobbesian ethical naturalism lies in its prudential import. The thesis also found that Hobbesian ethical naturalism was filled with contradictions and false assumptions such that a total acceptance of it is not conducive to ethical development. It was also the findings or this thesis that in general, ethical naturalism suffers from its over-emphasis on scientific facts and from its limitation of experience.The thesis concluded that though ethical naturalism may give some good answers to certain important ethical questions, it is philosophically inadequate, and implausible as a meta-ethical theory.

The Basidiomycota, the most advanced fungi, grow mainly in the wild although some edible ones are cultivated globally. This present work was designed to screen some of the wild mushrooms of our ecological environment for antimicrobial activity and to examine the possibility of laboratory cultivation of the species with significant activity.Fifteen wild mushroom species available at the time of foraying were collected and tentatively identified. The fruit-bodies were extracted with 50% aqueous ethanol. The extracts were evaporated to dryness in-vacuo and screened for antimicrobial activity using the agar diffusion method at a concentration of 40mg/ml in 50% aqueous methanol. The results of the screening revealed that seven of the mushrooms namely Polyporus sulphureus, Marasmus androsaceus, Cyathus striatus, Polyporus dermoporus, Schizophyllum commune, Ganoderma concentrica and Pycnoporus cinnabarinus demonstrated activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. Selective marginal activity against B. subtilis was exhibited by four other species namely Polyporus betulinus, Inonotus sp., Panellus strypticus and Lepiota molybditis. Russula sp., which displayed the best activity of all the fungi, was active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staph. aureus and B. subtilis but showed no activity against Escherichia coli. The remaining three species, Auricularia auricula judae, Termitomyces sp. and Lentinus squarrosulus, did not show activity against any of the test organisms. None of the extracts exhibited any antifungal activity against Candida pseudotropicalis.Russula sp. and Pycnoporus cinnabarinus were subjected to laboratory cultivation by spore germination and tissue culturing on solid agar plates. Culture and solid state fermentation on rice grains. Bioautographic evaluation of the submerged fermentation revealed that both the culture filtrate and the mycelial extract of Russula sp. displayed antimicrobial activity while only the culture filtrate demonstrated activity in Pycnoporus cinnabarinus. The activity of the solid state fermentation was exhibited by the ethyl acetate fractions while the aqueous fractions showed no activity. The comparison of the culture filtrates (ethyl acetate fractions) of submerged fermentation and the ethyl acetate fractions of solid state fermentation displayed similar activities.The bioactive compound production monitored in a submerged fermentation, using agar diffusion method, revealed that the metabolite production peaked on the fourth day in Russula sp., and on the fifth day in Pycnoporus cinnabarinus with subsequent decrease in activity of the fermentation extract. Dry weight increases with fermentation time in both mushrooms.This study has revealed that the species of Pycnoporus cinnabarinus and Russula sp., possess some antibacterial principles which could serve as potential sources of medicinal agents. This work has also provided an additional information on the antimicrobial property of Russula species because very little report on this is available. Previous works on the fruitbodies of Pycnoporus cinnabarinus and related species indicated the isolation of a red pigment, cinnabarrine as the antimicrobial metabolite. It is evident from the thin layer chromatographic profile on the culture extract of this species that the metabolite responsible for the bioactivity is not a pigment.|Theses Collection|Mushrooms/fruit-bodies/fermentation/bioautograph/mycelia extract/cinnabarrine/chromatographic/Pycnoporus cinnabarinus/Russula sp/agar diffusion/Basidiomycota*||||||Farewo, Florence Alaba|F|Simulation studies of distributed protocol for computer networking communication||||||M.Sc.

Most developing countries including Nigeria have not been fully integrated into this global village. In Nigeria, there is no national network and most individual networks available are not nationally coordinated and the system of addressing being employed on them does not reflect a national flag. Thus, the need for a reliable and an efficient national network has led to the design of a nation-wide Wide Area Network (WAN) christened NINET for Nigerian NETwork. Its design proposes to interconnect heterogeneous computers all over the country into a WAN to allow coordinated access to computer facilities that are geographically remote from one another.This study designed and simulated network standards that would regulate communication between any two computers connected on the NINET. This was achieved by studying among others, the two popular network protocols; the International Standard Organization Open System Interconnection (ISO-OSI) and the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Their protocol functions were examined and compared with the protocol layers specified for NINET. The functions at the Data link control, the lowest level layer of NINET were designed and standards relating to packetization of user message, error detection scheme, addressing scheme, data encryption strategies, national database structure were studied and appropriate models were proposed for NINET implementation.New physical structure that incorporates all states within the federation was made for NINET and an appropriate address subnetting scheme for node identification was designed and distributed. The Data Link Control functions were simulated and programmed using C programming language while other layers already simulated were discussed. Two computers were able to communicate with each other upon handshaking and bits were transmitted. The results of programming packet disassembling and reassembling function with or without bit stuffing, error detection program module, data encryption model and database inquiries were presented.|Theses Collection|Wide Area Network/International Standard Organization Open System Interconnection/Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol *||||||Dere, Modupe Olufunmilayo|F|Studies on the simultaneous assay of the components of co-trimoxazole dosage forms||||||M.Sc.

The drug is susceptible to adulteration because of the commercial prospects. The official method of assay involves prior separation of constituents either by extractive procedures as in the British Pharmacopoeia (B. P.) or by chromatography as in the United States Pharmacopoeia (U.S.P.). The extensive extraction process involved in the B.P. method is time Consuming, tedious and expensive due to the costly solvents that are used. The U.S.P. method also involves the use of expensive equipment which is not affordable and where available, frequent breakdown and lack of money to procure necessary spare parts and the expertise to repair the machines have rendered them mostly unserviceable.There is, thus, the need to devise easier, reproducible, accurate and more economical methods for routine assay of both components in co-trimoxazole formulations. The present work explores the possibility of uv difference spectrophotometry and non-aqueous potentiometric titration in the simultaneous determination of sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim in co-trimoxazole preparations.The differences in uv absorption of sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim in acetate buffer pH 5.O and IM NaOH have been exploited in the quantitation of both compounds in co-trimoxazole preparations. The method is amenable to the determination of sulphamethoxazole, giving accurate percentage recoveries, but not for trimethoprim. The weak basic properties of sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim have also been exploited in a non-aqueous titrimetric method for their simultaneous determination in co-trimoxazole preparations. The method has worked very well with the various samples used giving precise and accurate result.|Theses Collection|Trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole/co-trimoxazole/uv absorption/chromatography/acetate buffer*||||||Dare, Samuel  Olugbenga|M|A womanist critique of selected plays of  Soyinka||||||M.A. Literature in English|M.E.M.

Womanism is the African expression of Western feminism and its emphasis is Africa. As a gender theory, it emphasizes cultural contextualisation through an inclusive approach. Though a relatively new ideology in African literature, it is a valid perspective in African literary studies.Some critics believe that most of the portrayal of women in African literature is negative hence; this work examines the issue through gender ideological view point, its method being a survey and a dialectical textual analysis of some selected plays of Wole Soyinka. Therein his treatment and attitude to women characters are evaluated against the paradigms of womanism. Also an attempt is made to evaluate the plight of African women as the base of the critique of society and as agent of social change.The findings reveal that Soyinka is prejudiced in his portrayal of women characters in some of his plays. It also surfaced that Soyinka fails to create new realities but only re-asserts the existing social cultural experience thus limiting the growth and development of his female character.Finally this research proffers the minimum consideration of the objective consideration of the position of the African women within the organic African society.|Theses Collection|Contextualisation/womanism/feminism*||||||Bamiwuye, Samson  Olusina|M|Factors motivating extramarital sexuality and their implications for STDs/HIV transmission in Ile-Ife||||||M.Sc.

The mean age at first intercourse for males is 17.3 years and for females is 15.1 years. The mean number of sexual partner in the last year for males is 3.1 and for females is 1.2. The bulk of women who had extramarital relations had it because of economic considerations.Added to the issue of multiplicity of sexual partners is the low adoption of condoms even among parties involved in extramarital sexual behaviour. The age-long cultural belief that semen can pollute breastmilk does not help matter. Men generally do not approve of the use of condom when wife is breastfeeding. The bulk of these men expressed the fear that condoms can burst during intercourse and semen can then escape and contaminate the breastmilk.Favourable attitude to money and or material compensation for sex correlates significantly with high level of extramarital sex. Women economic status is also found to predict significantly level of extramarital relations. Increasing economic hardships in the country have forced many people young or old to resort to promiscuous sexual behaviour to make a living. Unfortunately most of these illicit sexual relationships go unprotected. The fear of AIDS let alone other STDs is of less concern than the immediate lack of basic necessity such as food, clothes and shelter. Incidence of sexually transmitted diseases correlates significantly with level of extramarital sex.Survey results though show a high level of awareness of AIDS among men and women, the proportion of respondents reporting incorrect mode of transmission e.g. by evil spirits is also high. This clearly shows that more detailed information about HIV modes of transmission and prevention means are needed.Since marital infidelity is widespread and seems to be morally acceptable in Ile-Ife, an effort should be made to target married adults for education on AIDS.The study suggests more in-depth analysis on the extramarital sexual behaviour using more comprehensive assessment of variables measuring extramarital sexuality. Future endeavours using qualitative research methods could also allow for an improved understanding of factors motivating extramarital sex in Ile-Ife.|Theses Collection|Extramarital sexuality/condoms/semen/breastmilk/AIDs/STDs/HIV*||||||Bamire, Simeon  Adebayo|M|Factors influencing the adoption of fertilizer technology in Osun State of Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Agricultural Economics|Y.L.

One major approach to this, is increasing the adoption of agricultural technologies that would enhance farmers' productivity and maintain the land resource potential.This study examined those factors that bear on farmers' adoption decisions of fertilizer technology, and the extent of use of the technology on adoption in Osun State of Nigeria. Primary data were collected using structured questionnaire and focus group discussions, while the State's Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Development Project provided secondary information. Multi-stage sampling technique was employed to select three hundred respondents from two major agroclimatic zones in the state. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, Tobit regression technique, and costs and returns analysis.The socio-economic characteristics of respondents showed that 91% were male and of an average age of 51 years. Respondents were smallholders with mean farm size of 0.58ha for users and 0.62ha for non-users of fertilizer. Farms were fallowed for an average of two years and inorganic fertilizer was the most common intensification technology used in the area. Results from correlation analysis showed that respondents' farm size and net farm income have direct significant relationships with farmers' adoption recisions in the study area.Tobit regression estimates on all factor categories revealed that the availability of fertilizer, farm size and net farm income were highly significant in explaining fertilizer adoption decisions in the survey location, while estimates for each factor category showed that age and gender; farm size and net farm income; availability of fertilizer and mode of land acquisition showed statistically significant effects on respondents' fertilizer adoption decisions. Decomposition of fertilizer adoption elasticities showed that the availability of fertilizer and farm size had the greatest impact on the probability of fertilizer adoption and use in the derived savanna zone, while only the availability of fertilizer recorded a similar impact in the rain forest zone. Partial budget analysis revealed that average net income earned by maize growing respondents who used nitrogenous fertilizers in the rain forest zone was N21,507 per annum while non-users recorded is #15,681. Similarly, respondents in the derived savanna zone recorded N21, 553 and N13, 865 respectively for the two categories of respondents. The difference between the mean net income earned by users and non-users of fertilizer in each zone was highly significant at 5% level. A break-even price of about N14 and N18 respectively was also estimated for the rain forest and derived savanna zones.These results imply that fertilizer pricing policies should be designed to optimize the interest of farmers, while efficient marketing and distribution arrangements are important in enhancing the efficiency of both fertilizer use and supply. A policy that increases the quantity of fertilizer allocated to farmers will also be a more effective instrument for increasing expenditure on the technology.|Theses Collection|Agroclimatic zones/Tobit regression technique/inorganic fertilizer/decomposition/nitrogenous *||||||Balogun, Temitope  Hammed|M|Influence of morphological and phenological traits on the yield of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata  (L)  Walp||||||M.Sc.

Data were collected each season on phenological, morphological and yield traits.Six phenological traits studied were: days to 50% flower bud (ID'S), days to first flower formation (DFF), days to 50% flower formation (DFFS), days to first pod physiological maturity (DPM), days to 50% physiological maturity (DPM5) and days to seed fill (DSF ). Out of the traits, BDF5 and DFF were the two most important and accounted for 38.84% of the observed variation in grain yield. In this investigation, BDF5 varied between 35.50 for variety 15 (IT93K - 624) and 49.50 for variety 2 (IT89KD - 245) while DFF varied between 37.88 for variety 15 (lT93k - 624) and 50.00 for variety 2 (IT89KD - 245).The effects of six morphological traits were evaluated on grain yield. The six morphological traits studied were number of nodes per plant (NNP), number of branches per plant (NBP), number of penduncles per plant (NPP), number of pods per plant (NPD), length of peduncle (LPE) and number of seeds per pod (NSD). The two most critical morphological traits which had significant effect on grain yield were NPP and NPD. The two traits jointly accounted for 72.52% of total variation observed for grain yield. There were positive and significant correlation coefficients between NBP and each of NNP, NPP and NPD, with values of 0.66, 0.55 and 0.52, respectively.The five highest yielding varieties were: 19, 8, 17, 20 and 15 i.e. (IFOB93/42A), (IT90K - 277-2), (IT93K - 876), (IF0B93/74B) and (IT93K - 624). They produced grain yields of 1670.5, 1385.8, 1285.1 1247.1 and 1220.8kg/ha, respectively.Substantial genetic variability for biomass yield determined at anthesis and harvest maturity were obtained. Varieties 14, 3, 8, i.e. (IT90K - 59), (IT89KD- 260) and IT90K - 277-2) with mean values of 49.10kg/ha/day ((I), 44.73kg/ha/d and 41.92kg/ha/d produced high biomass anthesis while varieties 8, 19 and 3 i.e. (IT93k - 277-2), (IFOB93/42A) and IT89KD - 260) produced 89. 27kg/ha/d, 87.05kg/ha/d and 85.40kg/ha/d, respectively at harvest maturity. They also produced I385.5kg/ha, 1670.5kg/ha/and 977. 11kg/ha, grain yield, respectively. They are good dual purpose varieties that combine high biomass at maturity with high grain yield.Variety 19 (IFOB93/42A) is not only high yielding in terms of biomass and grain yield, it is also early maturing. Varieties with high estimates for yield growth rate (YGR), yield accumulation per day of plant growth (YDACC) and yield per day of seed fill (YDSF) were consistently high yielding. The performance of varieties 19 (IF0B93/42A), 8 (IT90K - 277-2), 15 (IT93K - 624) and 17 (IT93K - 876) corroborates this observation.|Theses Collection|Phenological traits/physiological maturity/biomass/Vigna unguiculata (L) Walp/randomised complete block design/seed fill/penduncles*||||||Akinsanola, Iyiola  Mofolorunso|M|The impact of local government agricultural investments on rural development in selected local government areas of Osun State, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The study compared the allocations to agriculture out of local government static annual budgetary allocations to other sectors within the local governmentDescriptive statics were employed as methods of data analysis. Financial ratios such as rates of return to capital invested, turnover ratio as well as the examination of physical efficiencies of worker and hectare of land used for the production were considered. The study also examined the agricultural and non-agricultural activities of the local governments.Results of the analyses revealed that allocations to agriculture in each local government (ranging from 3.49% in Ayedade to 17.24% in Ife Central Local Governments) were grossly inadequate, and hence, accounted for why the impact of investments on agriculture could not be adequately felt in area of rural development.Also, investments on maize and cassava were profitable ventures which if adequately funded, could generate enough funds to the local government for the prosecution of other development projects.|Theses Collection|Bbudgetary allocations/financial ratios/turnover ratio/agriculture/hectarage/investment*||||||Adebola, Olubunmi  Janet|F|Purification and partial characterization of a protein with antiviral activity from the root of  Petivera alliacea  (Linn)||||||M.Sc.

This study was designed to investigate the possibility of the phosphate buffered saline extract of Petiveria alliacea [Linn] posessing antiviral activity.Proteins from fresh roots of P. alliacea- were extracted, purified and characterized by a procedure which consisted of salt extraction, salt precipitation with solid ammonium sulphate and fractionation on Sephadex G-150.The purity was adjudged by the presence of a single band of protein after sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel eletrophoresis [SDSPAGE].The proteins were fractionated into two namely protein I and protein II. The two proteins gave a single band each on polyacrylamide gel eletrophoresis under non- denaturing conditions which implied that they were single polypeptides. But protein 1 in the presence of SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol gave four non-identical subunits which showed that protein l may at least be a tetramer. The molecular weight of the native protein I was estimated to be about 105,900 daltons while the four non-identical subunits have molecular sizes of 32,360, 28,840, 22,900 and 17,780 daltons respectively. Protein I was observed to have about 13 sugar residues, 8 sulphydryl groups, It was extremely toxic to cultures of Heps and Vero cells 10pg/10,000cells and not toxic to rats. It was able to reduce the infective titres of polio Virus and Yellow fever Virus [Batch NO 69834Band304165H] by 100 TICD log10 and inhibited the multiplication of the two Viruses by 29.8% and 38.7% respectively. Investigations have shown that any molecule that was able to reduce the infective titre of any Virus by 100 log1010-1 is regarded as a potent antiviral agent .Since protein 1 was able to reduce the infective titres of both viruses by 100 TCIDIog,10 10-2, it can be considered to be a potent antiviral agent.|Theses Collection|P. alliacea/salt extraction/salt precipitation/fractionation/ephadex G-150/polyacrylamide/gel eletrophoresis/polypeptides/tetramer/sulphydryl groups*||||||Adedokun, Sunday  Adetayo|M|An evaluation of the reproductive performance of the Nigerian indigenous chicken ecotypes||||||M.Phill  Animal Science|E.B.

In a crossbreeding experiment, specific groups of the NIC (i.e. Fulani, Fu; Fulani dwarf, FuD from the Northern Guinea Savanna and Yoruba, Y from the DS) and the DR and DRD were used to produce four genetic groups DR x Fu, Fu x DR, DR x Y, and FuD x DRD which were also evaluated for the traits listed above.Data for this work were collected over a five-year period (I993-1998). A total of 579 eggs from DS and RF zones, 505 growers from DS, GS and RF zones, and 584 and 48 imported day-old DR and DRD chicks, respectively, were evaluated. Data compilation was by D Base IV. Data were analysed using the General Linear Model (GLM) procedure of Statistical Analysis System (SAS). Ecological zone, age and sex were the fixed effects in the model. Means of the variables were compared using the Least-Square Analysis of Variance and Duncan option of SAS.Percent fertility and hatchability of fertile eggs of 17.I9 and I3.99 and 63.33 and 59.26 were recorded for hatchable eggs purchased from the rural areas of the RF and DS zones, respectively. The percent fertility and percent hatchability recorded for fertile eggs produced by the mating of the NIC and DR were 72.38 and 42.75 respectively. For all the traits evaluated, there was no significant difference (P>0.05) between NIC from the three ecological zones. Therefore, pooled NIC means were compared with the means for the DR and the crosses between them. The DR were superior to both the NIC and their crosses in all the traits studied except percent laying mortality while the crossesin turn were superior to the NIC except for percent laying mortality. The DR x Fu crosshad a significantly higher (P<0.05) egg weight and egg number with a percent peak egg production of 72.32 while the reciprocal cross (Fu x DR) came into lay at a significantly earlier age than DR x Fu cross. The same relationship was observed for body weights.  traits studied. This could be attributed to the effect of the exotic cock. Repeatability estimates for egg weight for the NIC from six different locations ranged between 0.15 and 0.90. Results of the skin test showed FuD x DRD, DR x Y and Fu x DR with values of 0.45mm, 0.36mm and 0.34mm respectively. FuD x DRD had the highest skin response to phytohaemagglutinin inoculation, hence, highest resistance to disease is expected. Phenotypic correlation coefficients between body weight, shank length and body weight at first egg were positive and moderate to high in magnitude but were negatively correlated with age at first egg.  Results of this experiment showed that there was no significant difference in the performance of NIC from the three ecological zones for most of the traits studied. Hence, the NIC cannot be said to belong to different genetic groups. Also, the performance of the NIC with respect to egg weight, egg production and body weight can be substantially increased through crossbreeding with high yielding exotic cocks.|Theses Collection|Ecological zones/egg production/dahlem red dwarf/hatchability/general linear model/duncan option of SAS/laying mortality/crossbreeding   *||||||Adetunmbi, Moses Adeolu|M|A contextual analysis of worship in the Ekiti Anglican Diocese 1970-1995||||||M.A. Religious Studies|D.O.

Inspite of this perceived importance and development of the subject: Worship- it has not been given its worth-while attentions by scholars. This Study is a critical analysis of contextual worship in the Ekiti Anglican Diocese. It covered the period between 1970 and 1995. The Study examined the changes that the Anglican pattern of Worship in Ekiti Diocese has undergone between the period under study.The study utilised the historical, phenomenological and missiological theoretical approaches in the analysis of worship. It traced the historical development experiences and contribution of Anglicanism to the religious scenario in Ekitiland. Attempts were made to contextualise Ekiti Diocesan Anglican Worship and account for the emerging trends.The work has established that the worship setting of the Anglican Church was right but needed to absorb certain changes in order to give room for dynamism. For example, the practice of playing trumpets, drums, guitars, piano, Bible study during mattins were innovations in Ekiti Anglican liturgy. Other changes include praying aloud, Testimonies and Revivals.

The purpose was to determine the plant's size requirements, predict the economic viability, technical and socio-cultural acceptability index of harnessing biogas technology for cooking, as well as to suggest strategies for using the technology at the household level in Nigeria.Data were collected mainly from primary sources. These sources included the agricultural households, current biogas users, engineers, researchers, and equipment suppliers and fabricators. Questionnaire survey and interview techniques were used to elicit information from respondents. Both quantitative and qualitative analytical tools were used to analyze the primary data.The engineering design results revealed that a digester volume (Vd) of 6.0m3, and gasholding volume (Vg) of 1.20m3, will adequately meet the daily gas demand for cooking an average of 9.0 persons per household, using cattle dung as substrate.The study also revealed that, using the dynamic evaluation method for micro-economic assessments, the Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Benefit-Cost Ratio, and Payback Period of the financial analysis of the digester were Fifty Thousand Naira, 17.52%, 2.26, and 6.6 years respectively.

The study further revealed that, technically and socio-culturally, 86.1% and 83.3% of respondents would like to continue with the use of biogas.  These findings showed that cooking-energy investment in family size fixed-dome plant in Nigeria is design feasible, economically viable, technically and socio-culturally acceptable. It is therefore suggested that household application should be encouraged at the three tiers of government in Nigeria so as to save households from cooking-fuel crises.|Theses Collection|Net present value/internal rate of return/benefit-cost ratio/payback period/biogas/digester volume/gasholding voulme*||||||Adepoju, Akeem  Oludare|M|Indigenous institutions and customary laws in Osogbo 1950-1960||||||M.Sc.

Four hundred (400) Junior Secondary School III Students were randomly selected from eight schools in Osogbo area. Two hundred students from four schools were assigned to the treatment of Inverse Matrix method (the experimental group) while the other two hundred were assigned to the treatment of Elimination method (the control group) for a week after which they were tested. Data for the study were collected using three achievement tests (pretest, post-test and retention test) and were analysed using t-test and One Way Analysis of variance (ANOVA).The results showed that the students taught with Inverse Matrix Method (IMM) performed better than the students taught with elimination method (ELM). This is because IMM involves straight forward steps that can easily be understood by students than ELM. The students taught with IMM were also found to retain the knowledge of simultaneous linear equations better than those taught with ELM when tested four weeks after the training. It was also found out that students in Urban areas performed better than the students in rural areas in both IMM and ELM groups. Likewise boys performed better than girls in the two methods.The study thus showed that IMM is effective in the teaching and learning of problems involving simultaneous linear equations in the secondary school and in addition, it can be used to improve students performance in such problems in Mathematics.|Theses Collection|Inverse matrix method/elimination method/simultaneous linear equations/Analysis of variance*||||||Adewole, Olarinde Stephen|M|Some histochemical and histological studies of the pancreas of alloxan-induced diabetes mellitus in wistar rats||||||M.Sc.

This thesis is concerned, with the study of some qualitative properties of solutions, of a certain class of fifth order non-linear ordinary differential equations by using the frequency-domain method. The properties of solution that are considered are: stability, boundedness, periodicity and almost periodicity.We started with a review of the basic results of Lure, Popov, Yacubovich, Kalman and the generalizations of Afuwape, Barbalat and Halanay, which is the bedrock of the frequency-domain method. We further applied this method to the fifth-order non-linear differential equations that we considered and thereby extending an earlier work of Afuwape.By exploiting the mathematical richness of calculus, and geometry, we showed under explicitly stated conditions that, the equations considered have a unique solution that is bounded on the real line, globally exponentially stable, and that this unique solution, is periodic or almost periodic according as the forcing term is periodic or almost periodic.|Theses Collection|Frequency-domain method/periodicity/boundedness/stability/non-linear differential equations/calculus/geometry*||||||Agbaje, Ezekiel Ayowole|M|Financial aspects of housing management in  Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria||||||M.PHIL.

Emphasis is placed on level of awareness and usage of the traditional medicine under study; socio-economic and personal characteristics of the adopters of the technology; characteristics of the technology in relation to its adoption and community cultural factors that are associated with the adoption of the traditional medicine preparation. Data were collected from one hundred and seventy-nine (179) farmers randomly selected from the two blocks that made up the Local Government Area through the use of structured interview schedule. The information collected was analyzed using frequency distribution, multiple correlation and regression analysis.The results of the findings showed that a majority of the respondents (85.4%) were fully aware of the technology and about 96.0% of those that had heard about the innovation were interested in its adoption irrespective of their age, sex and religious affiliation.The study further revealed that Age and Farming Experience with correlation coefficient (r) of 0.3249 and 0.3619 respectively were positively related to the adoption of the innovation under study. Other characteristics of the adopters that were significantly and negatively related to the adoption were level of education (r= -0.2026) and cosmopoliteness (r= 0.1908). The study also showed that majority of the farmers agreed that the innovation was not too complex to use. It was culturally compatible, readily available, open to discussion and less costly. The only community related factor that was positively and significantly related to the adoption of the innovation was the traditional religious practices (r= 0.2305). Other factors such as Christian and Islamic religious practices (r= -0.4961), presence of various agricultural institutions (r= -0.2310) and community leadership in farm matters (r= -0.2198) showed negative but significant relationship with the adoption of the indigenous medicine under study.|Theses Collection|Traditional medicine/bird control/rice fields/farming experience/age/culture/religious practice/agricultural institutions/community leadership*||||||Agugo, Felix Otitochukwu|M|Development of a frequency scaling circuit fot analogue signals||||||M.Sc.

Down-scaling in this sense appears like a mathematical multiplication of the waveform frequencies by any scaler, Ü, in the domain 0< Ü <l. The original signal may be recovered by up-scaling, i.e. an operation which entails the multiplication of the down-scaled waveform by 1/Ü (the inverse of the number used for down-scaling).This project presents the mathematical development, and the circuit realization of a new technique for performing the frequency scaling operations for analogue waveforms which may be used in a novel bandwidth scaling scheme.Mathematical analysis and experimental tests/trials were used to develop a circuit which can achieve linear scaling over a wide range of frequencies. The circuit consists of a Wien bridge oscillator and a frequency-controlled resistor circuit. The oscillator was designed to give significant frequency variation by varying the equivalent resistance of the frequency-controlled resistor (FCR) circuit. Thus, the instantaneous value of the oscillator output frequency was made to be dependent on the equivalent resistance of the FCR at that instant, which in-turn is a function of the instantaneous input frequency. The results of the experimental tests of the circuit show that it has frequency transformation characteristics adequate for its use in the development of a novel bandwidth scaling scheme.|Theses Collection|waveform frequencies/novel bandwidth/Wien bridge oscillator/oscillator/frequency-controlled resistor circuit  *||||||Ahmadu, Bolatito Asiata|F|A critical study of the feminist challenge to ethical theory||||||M.A. Philosophy|Moses.

The study identified some stakeholders who are responsible for and affected by the problem of solid waste disposal in the city. These stakeholders include, the state government, local government, Private Refuse Contractors, residential and commercial users, and community-based organizations among others. The roles played by each of them were critically examined.The framework of analysis adopted for the study is the Institutional Analysis Approach. Both primary and secondary sources of data were employed for the study. The primary data included questionnaire and interview methods. Secondary data were collected from library materials and official documents.The result showed that the administration of solid waste disposal in Ibadan metropolis is the exclusive preserve of the state government through its agent - Ibadan Solid Waste Management Authority. The administration of solid waste disposal which initially belonged to the local government authorities was withdrawn a few years ago. The study discovered that despite the transfer, the state government's efforts at effective administration of solid waste disposal in the metropolis are not better off. Also, it was discovered that some registered Private Refuse Contractors operate in the metropolis particularly in the core and planned areas with the permission of the Ibadan Solid Waste Management Authority (ISWMA). The Authority only collects and disposes solid waste in the market areas. The study shows that very few households are involved in the exercise, majority still burn or dump their solid waste in any available open land. Ignorance about the health implications of such practices and the political instability which has weakened enforcement of laws all make illegal disposal thrive. Our findings also shows that refuse collection and disposal is no more free in the metropolis, as users charge is levied on the recipients of waste disposal service. The inevitability of involving the households and market users along with the local government is confirmed by the findings of the study. Since participation is a crucial element in the generation of capabilities for development, environmental decision-making requires an open system in which a larger number and varieties of actors are involved in it and key stakeholders are included in the administrative process.|Theses Collection|Private refuse contractors/Ibadan solid waste management authority/illegal disposal/political instability/environmental decision-making *||||||Ojo, Stephen Okunlola|M|An evaluation of procurement methods in building projects in south-western Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The thesis therefore evaluated the procurement methods employed in building construction in South-Western Nigeria.In order to achieve this objective, questionnaires were administered on clients, consultants and contractors in Lagos, Oyo, Osun, Ekiti, Ondo, Ogun and. Edo States. The clients studied varied from Ministries to Parastatals and Academic Institutions. The consultants included quantity surveyors, architects, builders and engineers. The contractors were drawn from medium indigenous to large-sized multinational companies. A total of one hundred and thirty-five questionnaires were distributed to clients (40), consultants (55) and contractors (40), using stratified random sampling. Seventy-seven were duly completed and returned, 23 by clients, 36 by consultants and 18 by contractors. Simple percentage, mean percentage change, mean cost overrun, mean time overrun and graphical methods were used to analyse the data. The t-test of difference was used to test the results particularly in comparing the means of the procurement methods on cost and time overruns because the samples were independently drawn.The results showed that the five procurement methods namely, traditional contract, project management, management contracting, design and build, and direct labour were used by client and that the traditional contract method was mostly used. Analysis of the data showed that, for all project cases (i.e. without division into cost sizes), the direct labour method least overran its estimated construction time (26.9%) compared with that of traditional contract method of 135.9%, management contracting (72.4%), design and build (36.3%) and project management (29.5%). The analysis also showed that management contracting projects least overran their estimated construction costs (20.9%) while traditional contract projects had the highest overrun of 42.6%. The results also showed that clients were more satisfied with the quality of design and build projects than projects of other procurement methods. Clients were least satisfied with the quality of direct labour projects.    The study concluded that to achieve a successful project using these five procurement methods may be elusive. The study has suggested that the design and build, project management and management contracting methods would be most appropriate for complex projects.

The reliability of kernel dry weight, milk line, black layer and ear moisture percent as estimators of PM were compared. The study was designed to provide information to bridge the gap between the much studied agronomy of maize and the little-understood physiology of seed development.Accumulation of dry matter in the kernels was monitored at weekly intervals from 3 to 59 days after silking (DAS) in both hybrids. Kernels were also concurrently rated for other maturity indices. Seed samples were removed at weekly intervals from 31 DAS till 59 DAS; for a total of five maturity stages. Seed samples from the maturity stages were used as treatment in all laboratory and field investigations. Three regression models were used to determine PM from kernel dry weight, and regression analysis was performed on variables for both laboratory and field experiments. For both hybrids, the indices gave different estimates of the time PM was attained. The pattern of dry matter accumulation in both hybrids was similar. Although the R2 for the three regression equations for each of the two hybrids were highly significant (P<0.01), only the cubic model gave seasonable estimates of the time of attainment of PM; 41 DAS for Oba Supa 1 and 48 DAS for Oba Supa 2.Generally, performance of seeds of the third maturity stage (harvested at 45 DAS) was better than that of other stages in all laboratory and field investigations. The estimate of PM obtained from the regression of kernel dry weight on DAS closely approximated the time at which seeds of the third maturity stage were harvested . Performance of seeds of the fourth maturity stage was exceptionally poor in all laboratory and field investigations. Both in the laboratory and the field, there was no significant maturity stage effect on viability of seeds harvested at the first, second, third and fifth maturity stages. However, seeds removed before full maturity, irrespective of kernel dry weight germinated faster, having significantly lower emergence indices than those harvested at full maturity. The rate at which seedlings accumulated dry matter during the first 30 days after planting in the field was closely related to the seed dry weight.The prevailing concept that PM is a function of kernel dry weight fails to take into full consideration, the interplay of physiological processes that are associated with a seed from formation to emergence after planting.

The objectives of the study were to isolate and identify bacterial species implicated in cases of septicaemia and to determine the antibiotic sensitivity profile of the bacterial isolates at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Complex Ile-Ife. This study was carried out between February 1994 and April 1995.One hundred and seven neonates were studied. The specimens were blood, urine, wounds and cerebrospinal fluid samples obtained from these patients. The primary isolation medium was blood agar and isolates were identified based on standard bacteriological techniques using cultural, morphological and biochemical characteristics. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the bacterial isolates were determined by the disc diffusion methods.A total of one hundred and eighteen samples were positive for microorganisms upon culture. Sixty two (52.5%) were cultured from blood, 24 (30.3%) were cultured from cerebrospinal fluid, 15 (12.7%) from urine and 17 (14.4%) wounds. The results showed that a number of features such as prolonged rupture of the membranes, jaundice, low birth weight and asphyxia should be employed in determining the criteria for categorizing neonates at high risk of developing septicaemia. Eighteen different bacterial species were isolated and identified. Six different bacterial species predominated namely: Staphylococcus aureus (30%), Pseudomonas sp (18.6%), Escherichia poll (9.3%), Klebsiella sp (12.6%), Citrobacter freundii (5%) and Listeria monocytogenes (43%). The incidence of septicaemia was higher in males (64.4%) than in females (35.6%). The isolation of Listeria monocytogenes was important since the organisms had not been implicated in past studies of neonatal septicaemia from this centre. The in vitro antibiotic sensitivity testing revealed that 86.6% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were resistant to ampicillin, while 80% were resistant to penicillin. In addition, 96.6% and 83.3% of Staphylococus aureus were resistant to cloxacillin and methicillin respectively, while 60% to chloraphenicol. The study shows the prevalence of meticilin resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates in the environment which is of epidemiological significant for the prevention and control of septicaemia.

The observed changes progressed in the lime rate and with time, an equilibrium being attained at about six weeks after lime application. Low rates of lime effected statistically significant improvement of soil available P and exchangeable K and Ca. The growth and dry matter yield of maize in the greenhouse were significantly enhanced even by the lowest rate of time used. The best growth performance and optimum dry matter yield were observed with application of 500 and 1000 mgCaCO3/kg soil in Epe and Onne respectively. Further additions of lime resulted in yield depressions in both soils. Plant uptake of major nutrient elements (P, K, Ca and Mg) was also increased by addition of lime. Optimum lime rates for nutrient uptake were either slightly lower than or similar to those that produced highest yields in each soil depending on lime type. Significant decreases in nutrient uptake were recorded at the highest rates of lime used. Grain yields produced by unlimed plots were only 16% and 21% of the maximum obtained from limed plots at Onne and Epe respectively.  Highest grain yields were obtained at lime rates equivalent to soil exchangeable aluminium multiplied by a factor of about 1.0 at both locations. Close correlations were obtained between grain yields and soil acidity factors (pH, -changeable acidity and aluminium), the highest relationship (r= - 0.8347) being obtained with EAl. Critical Al saturation was found to be 25% at Onne and 27% at Epe. Significant increases in leaf tissue concentration of Ca, Mg, P, K, Zn and Cu were affected by initial rates of lime. However, amounts of lime beyond rates required for optimum yields reduced the concentrations of these nutrients, micro elements being most affected Mn in leaf tissue was reduced at all levels of lime.The four lime sources used were all found capable of increasing crop yields as a direct result of neutralisation of soil acidity. While differences among lime rates were significant for most of the parameters tested, there were only either slight or no significant differences among the lime types. The effectiveness of the materials was order: hydrated lime. basic slag > cement fine dust > Mfamosing limestone. The highest residual effect was however obtained with Mfamosing limestone.|Theses Collection|Ameliorants/hydrated lime/optimum lime rates/leaf tissue concentration/soil acidity/soil pH  *||||||Ajetunmobi, Rasheed Owoyele|M|Migrations,settlements and socio-political development in coastal Yorubaland of Nigeria  1500- 1900||||||Ph.D. History|Biodun Adediran||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, History|1998|||OAU|||||ix,287p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

This study discussed the nature of the geographical environment; the historical origins of the major component settlements; the pattern of economic development, the dynamics of change as well as the extent of continuity in the socio-political and cultural organisations of the communities that existed in the region before 1900.The study was based on an extensive collection and analysis of oral data as well as ethnographic materials. In addition, archival materials and documents in private hands were consulted.The study revealed that the Yoruba occupied the coastal area for a combination of political, economic, social and religious reasons. It found that there was an original layer of aboriginal settlers thinly spread between the Niger Delta to the east and the estuary of the Oueme river to the west. But waves of migrations from the interior of Yorubaland from about 1500 led to the assimilation of pre-existing pockets of aboriginal inhabitants, the emergence of stable socio-political organisations and sub-ethnic differentiation. The thesis also found that the extension of Benin imperialism into coastal Yorubaland from the sixteenth century had significant socio-political and economic effects evident in the oral traditions, dialects, and socio-political institutions of the coastal Yoruba.By 1800, the divide and rule policy of the Benin conquerors resulted in the fragmentation of coastal Yorubaland into several semi-independent polities. Finally, the thesis discussed the effects of the 19th century wars which paradoxically resulted in the rise of Lagos and moves towards centralization among the Awori, the Ilaje and the coastal Ijebu.|Theses Collection|Cultural organisations/ethnographic/aboriginal settlers/estuary/Benin imperialism/dialects/divide and rule policy/fragmentation   *||||||Akinwunmi, Olumide Oluwole|M|Preparation and characterization of  (Indium Tin Oxide; ITO) pyrolytically deposited thin film from single solid precursor||||||M.Sc.

However, the properties of the deposited thin films depend mainly on the deposition techniques.The objectives of this work are; the preparation of the single solid precursor from appropriate reagent, deposition of ITO thin films using metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) technique and the characterization of the deposited films using Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (EDXRF), Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS). infrared (IR) and UV-visible spectrophotometer.The films were prepared using a single solid precursor of metalorganic compound of tin and indium and deposited on a soda lime glass substrate using MOCVD technique between temperatures of 320 °C to 420 °C.The precursor was characterized using IR spectrophotometer. The deposited films were characterized with the use of EDXRF, RBS for identification of the constituent elements, stoichiometry and thickness determination, IR and UV-visible spectrophotometer for optical studies. Van der Pauw method was used to measure the electrical characteristics of the films.In the IR region, the absorption spectra show the presence of metal and organic ligand for the precursor while in the deposited films no organic ligand was detected The analyses of the UV spectra show that the films are highly transmitting. Direct allowed optical energy gap of 3.76 eV was obtained for the film deposited at 380 °C, which gave the optimum properties of over 85% transmittance in the visible region and resistivity of 6.98 x 10-' 0cm at room temperature.The RBS confirmed the presence of the expected elements but could not give the stoichiometry because of the closeness of Indium and Tin in the periodic table. EDXRF confirmed the presence of indium and tin.Electrical measurements show that the film is highly conducting. The electrical conductivity was obtained to be 1.43 x 103 (0cm)-1 at room temperature and increased to  4.95 x 104 (Ocm)-1at 623 K. The activation energies of ITO thin film deposited at 380 °C were calculated from the plots of natural logarithms temperature and reciprocal of temperature. Activation energy of 0.2165 + 0.0013 eV was obtained.In conclusion, ITO thin films have been prepared by MOCVD and characterized. The results obtained from the optical and electrical characterization are comparable with known ITO thin films.|Theses Collection|Metalorganic chemical vapour deposition/energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence/infrared/uv-visible spectrophotometer/rutherford backscattering spectroscopy/ stoichiometry *||||||Adeyefa, Olusegun Gbadebo|M|Grammatical errors in the written English of junior secondary school three (JSS 3) pupils in Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria||||||M.A. English|W.B.

The schools were divided into three categories (good schools, average schools and below average schools) on the basis of the available records of performance in public examinations.  Two schools were randomly selected from each category of schools for a 40-minute English composition test which was written by the pupils in JSS 3 in each of the schools.The answer scripts collected from the pupils were analysed for occurrences of grammatical errors of various kinds. The scripts distribution percentages of the errors (SDPE) at the levels of Sentence, Phrase and Word were calculated. It was clear from the findings that the most common errors in the written English of the subjects pupils were bad punctuation (SDPE = 83.3%), error of tense (SDPE = 75.3%), wrong delineation of the sentence (SDPE = 71.3%), wrong use of sentence connectors (SDPE = 65.3%), wrong use of one or more dependent clauses as a sentence (SDPE = 51.3%) and errors of verbal phrase involving wrong forms (SDPE =50.8%).In the light of the findings, it was recommended that the problem areas should be given emphasis in the English lessons in the Junior Secondary School, and that the major textbooks for JSS 1, 2 and 3 pupils should be revised to take adequate care of the problem areas. Moreover, it was suggested that before any teacher is employed to teach English language, such a teacher, regardless of his academic qualifications, should be called for an interview and tested to determine his ability in the language.|Theses Collection|Grammatical errors/scripts distribution percentages of the errors/Sentence/Phrase/Tense/punctuation/sentence connectors/clause/verbal phrase*||||||Adubi, Kikelomo Olukemi|F|Changing role of women in the Rural family Institution in Osun State, Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Agricultural Extension & Rural Sociology|A.A.

It investigated the traditional roles currently performed and the modern roles currently performed by the women as a wife and as a mother. The study covered ten Local Government Areas from which twenty villages were chosen through systematic sampling technique with a random start. Two hundred and fifty respondents were interviewed, using a structured interview schedule between October 1995 and January 1996.Statistical tools employed in data analysis included frequencies and percentages, Chi-square, linear correlation, regression analysis and analysis of variance.The results showed that traditional roles currently performed by the women as a wife include: partial provision of labour on family farm, processing food crops for family consumption, house cleaning, laundering spouse's clothes and strengthening kinship bond. The traditional roles currently performed as a mother include lineage continuity by procreation, prolonged breast feeding to ensure infant survival and giving home training to siblings.The modern roles performed by the rural woman as a wife include membership in social groups with spouse and assisting in family finances. Those performed as a mother include: spacing births, contributing to child maintenance cost, employing gradual weaning system for infants, contributing to child educationcost and encouraging child involvement in clubs for socialization. About 60% of respondents	ascribed roles like looking after husband welfare caringfor his clothes, ensuring a clean home surrounding and assisting  husband on family farm. .About 70% perform achieved roles like protecting husband's integrity in the family participating in professional/trade association,- women societies and groups.Motivational factors indicated by mere than 70.. which facilitated performance of wife's roles are: recognition, feeling of achievement, conjugal stability, importance of housekeeping task itself for welfare of family members. There was a significant relationship between role performance and age, religion, level of education, major occupation, kinship pattern, marital status and marriage type. Most of the respondents (70.4%) were in the age range of 20-39 years, extra-local travel averaged 11 times per three months. Annual income was not less than N I9, 000, with non-farming as the major occupation.Correlation analysis showed positive and significant association between role performance and family social status (r = 0.288), years of schooling (r = 0.205), cosmopoliteness (r = 0.233), annual income (r = 0.244) and social group membership (r = 0.227). This indicates that role performance increased with increase in the above variables. The regression analysis showed positive and significant relationship between role performance and level of. satisfaction with marital life (t = 2. 186), motivational factors (t = 2.377) and shouldering family responsibility (t = 2.147). These represent the changes in these factors resulting from changes in role performance.Analysis of variance revealed non-significant difference between role perception and performance of ascribed wife role (F= 0.999), achieved wife roles (F=1.180); and ascribed mother roles (F= 1.183), between role perception and role performance of achieved mother roles (F=2.586).|Theses Collection|Procreation/breastfeeding/family planning/conjugal stability/kinship/child maintenance/weaning/laundering*||||||Aghware, Anslem Unurakpo|M|Development and simulation of an optimal machine-scheduling algorithm for a manufacturing firm||||||M.Sc.

The resultant effect of inappropriate capacity/volume planning and synchrony of the complex interactions between various mills often result in deadlocks, delays, machine idleness/overtasking within the system. The need for scientific planning towards operational efficiency of the manufacturing system, reduction in operational costs, and increased revenue necessitated this work. In this respect, an optimal scheduling algorithm was developed and simulated for the machine stations of a Timber and Plywood products factory.The facility's present configuration was studied and critically analyzed with the operations management team. To calibrate the model, historical data was gathered and used to deduce probability distributions for its job inter arrival times and that for the various workstations' service times. A random number generator was used jointly with these distributions and List processing algorithms to mimic the factory's operations. Statistical validation of the model data revealed 88% relationship with the system's job arrivals and service times. Confidence intervals constructed at 99% confidence level and Turing tests were also employed to determine the validity of the model results. Five performance level determinants of the product lines' machine-schedule optimality were used in the work. These are the average utilization of machines factor, average delay in workstations, average number of jobs in workstations' queues, product throughput, and the overall average delay in the factory for all jobs. A replication's optimality determining algorithm based on the model and performance factors was developed.The experimentation which ran for 180 days revealed existing bottleneck (idle or overtasking machine stations) points which were corrected in subsequent iterations towards optimality. achieved a 100% improvement in throughput (from 400 unit product turnouts to 800 units), 100% reduction in overall delays within the system (from I.48hrs to 0.0hrs) in addition to a significant gain in revenue from machine disposals amounting to about N5.06 million and consequent operational efficiency.

The rotifera fauna of waterbodies within the basin mainly River Gongola and its tributaries was investigated over the two seasons of the annual cycle from 1996 to 1997. Altogether 70 quantitative plankton samples were collected from various surface waterbodies (52 stations comprising of 32 lotic sites, 17 lentic sites, and 3 spring water sites) at representative locations by filtering 20litres of water through a plankton net(mesh size = 45µm) to reduce the sample to a concentrate volume of about 30ml. The concentrate volume was preserved in 5% Formalin solution and later treated with Lugo] solution for sedimentation of all suspended particles and plankters. The concentrate samples were examined at both scanning power (x40) and low power (x100) magnifications of the compound microscope. The encountered plankters were measured, counted and drawn for later identification which was clone based on previous work-done on rotifers in Nigerian waters.Some physicochemical parameters namely temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and pH were determined and their relationship with the recorded rotifera species' occurrence/abundance investigated using statistical analyses. The statistical analyses used include descriptive statistics, linear regression analyses, correlation analyses, cluster analyses and factor analyses using appropriate software (SAS, 1987) on personal computer.Thirty-seven species belonging to sixteen genera and ten families of two orders of the phylum Rotifera, the orders Ploima and Flosculariacea were recorded. The number of species per station varied from 0 to 14 with mean of 5 species per station. On the average, the highest numbers of species were recorded from lentic water sites with a mean of 6 species per station while the lowest were recorded from spring with a mean of 5 species per station. Abundance was slightly higher during the dry season than during the rainy season with mean values and standard error of 2693.8 ± 732.4 per m3 and 1183.0 ± 280.1 per m3 (P<0.05) respectively. The dominant common species were Keratella tropica, Brachionus calyciflorus, Brachionus falcatus, Brachionus quadridentatus, all belonging to the Family Brachionidae (48.2% of the total number of species). The subdominant species were Lecane (I,) curvicornls, Lecane (M) bulla, Lecane (L) luna,all belonging to the family Lecanidae (26% of the total number of species)Highly significant correlation coefficient values (P 0.01) were found between total rotifera abundance and conductivity while temperature and dissolved oxygen each showed weak negative correlation with total abundance of rotifers (P > 0.05).From the records of the number of rotifera species of other waterbodies in Nigeria, which was on the average 40 species per waterbody, the studied waterbodies were quite rich in rotifera fauna. With the list of species recorded having no pollution indicator species and their richness in Brachionus spp as well as presence of Asplanchna priodonta, Brachionus quadridentatus, Brachionus urceolaris, Keratella cochlearis, and Polvarthra vulgaris.It can be concluded that the waterbodies studied are mesosaprobiceutrophic and they are not much polluted and nutrient-rich.|Theses Collection|Zooplankton fauna/plankton/waterbodies/dissolved oxygen/conductivity/pH value/rotifera species/Asplanchna priodonta/Brachionus quadridentatus/ Brachionus urceolaris/Keratella cochlearis/Polvarthra vulgaris *||||||Olawoyin, Serifat Joke|F|The effect of motivation on staff teaching effectiveness in private and public secondary schools in Osun State||||||M.A. Educational Administration|M.A. Adelabu||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Educational Administarion and Planning|2000|||OAU|||||xiv,125p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Constant availability of these facilities is dependent largely on formidable and effective maintenance and replacement policy. This study therefore has as its main objectives the evaluation of maintenance and replacement policy in the telecommunications industry in Nigeria. This is to ensure maximum efficiency of utilization and growth of telecommunications infrastructures in Nigeria through appropriate policy.Primary and secondary data were collected from relevant organs in the telecommunications industry in the country. The respondents were in the maintenance and operations departments at NITEL headquarters, Nigeria Communications Commission, Ministry of Communications, users of telecommunications facilities and other organs of the industry in the south west area of Nigeria. The data were collected with the aid of questionnaire and interview guide and presented using descriptive statistic such as bar-chart, pie  chart and percentages.The results showed that the existing telecommunications infrastructures were poorly maintained and that the major faults on the infrastructures were due to cable faults, users attitude, willful damage from individuals or corporate organizations, cross-talk, and lockout. Other problems discovered as militating against maximum availability of telecommunications facilities in the country were attributable to low morale of staff and insufficient provision of necessary maintenance application and support systems, and logistics unavailability. In addition, the results showed that there were loose interaction and communication gap between telecommunications services providers and the users in the country. Appropriate strategies that could be incorporated into a comprehensive policy on manpower training, pre-start up documentation, funding, organization, proper coordination and harmonization of the activities of other government agencies and proper education of users of telecommunications facilities were proffered.|Theses Collection|Telecommunications/computers/ NITEL headquarters/Nigeria Communications Commission/Ministry of Communications/cable fault/cross-talk/lockout *||||||Olaoye, Adefoluke Omoyeni|F|A study of word formation problems in the written English of some senior secondary school III (SSS 3) pupils in three local government areas of Osun State||||||M.A. English|Bidemi Okanlawon||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, English|2000|||OAU|||||vi,75p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The purpose was to carry out the study of Achebe's A Man of the People from the perspective of Linguistic Stylistics. Only a few works exist in which texts have been analysed from this perspective.The methodology adopted in carrying out this study was based on the tools provided by pragmatics with emphasis on Grice's Cooperative Principle and its maxims. Dialogue passages that manifested examples of the use of the various maxims of Grice's Cooperative Principle were identified from the text, categorised, analysed and interpreted so as to discover their thematic functions.The study found that the application of certain methods of analyzing dialogue in the prose fictional text improved the quality of one's interpretation of the text. It was found for instance, that the maxims examined generally followed the guidelines for efficient communication during conversation, although in some instances they deviated from the guidelines in varying degrees. It was also found that the themes of corruption and irresponsibility were prominent in the text.The Linguistic Stylistics approach to the study of prose fiction benefits a lot from the inclusion of Grice's Cooperative Principle in the analytical procedure.

The analysis also shed more light on how the combination of these data could be used as an effective tool in correct interpretation and thus accurately indicate areas of severe corrosion attack, having taken into consideration the different environmental and other conditions to which the pipeline may be subjected. From the analysis of the photomicrographs, it was observed that there was localized corrosion, namely severe pitting and erosion sandcut in the pipeline and that there was an increase in the corrosive effect in the direction of the fluid flow as it passes through the pipeline when in use.In conclusion, various methods by which both the internal and external corrosion problems often encountered in the oil production processes can be solved at minimal cost were suggested.|Theses Collection|Corrosion/resistivity/metallography/wellhead/flowstation/photomicrographs/fluidflow/pipeline*||||||Oladeebo, Job Olatunji|M|The effects of scattered farm plots on agricultural production in Ogo-Oluwa and Oriire local government areas of Oyo State||||||M.Sc.

Primary data were collected through the use of structured questionnaires from two hundred farmers selected from eight villages in the two Local Government Areas during the 1996/97 cropping season. Data were analysed using ordinary least-square regression procedure, descriptive statistics and correlation technique.The study indicated that the need for food security of the farm families was mainly responsible for cultivating scattered farm plots. Scattered farm plots were more prevalent in Ogo-Oluwa LGA than Oriire LGA. Population pressure was another cause in Ogo-Oluwa LGA. It was discovered that the average farm size per farming household was 2.5 hectares while the average number of farm plots was about three. The results also indicated that the plots were located far from the homesteads to be readily serviced by the household as well as the hired labour. The average amount invested in farming to buy fertilizers, chemicals and payments for hired labour during the cropping season was about =N=9,218. This amount was statistically significant at the 5 percent level suggesting that an increase in the amount will lead to increase in gross farm income. About 67 percent of the farmers were natives of the study area and the main form of access to farm land was through inheritance as represented by 54.5 percent of the respondents.Scattered farm plots did not cause inefficiency among small-scale farmers contrary to the views of a number of researchers. Cultivation of scattered farm plots by the farmers took the advantage of different soil types thereby leading to a more diversified cropping pattern as represented by about 60.0 percent of the respondents. This offered the farmers a tool for combating food insecurity.The implication of the findings is that any government policy on land reform should be tailored towards the provision of more lands to the willing farmers. This could be achieved by allocating government reserved land to such willing farmers|Theses Collection|Scattered farm plots/agricultural production/food security/population pressure/farm size/labour/fertilizers/chemicals/farm income/inheritance/farm plot/cropping pattern/government policy/land reform  *||||||Oluga, Florence Adeola|F|A study of the bacterial isolates cultured from cases of Acute Otitis media in children in Ile-Ife||||||M.Sc.

Despite advances in public health, medical care and extensive research on various aspects of otitis media, this disease remains an important health care problem of childhood and is still prevalent around the world. This investigation was undertaken to determine the incidence of acute otitis media in this environment, to isolate and identify bacterial species recovered from children suspected of suffering from acute otitis media and to determine antibiotic susceptibility profile of some of the isolates.Fifty-three patients mainly infant/children participated in this study but only 15 were eventually diagnosed as having acute otitis media. Purulent samples from the ear were taken using cotton-tipped applicators while blood samples were collected using sterile needle and syringes. The primary isolation media were blood agar, mannitol salt agar and eosin methylene blue agar and isolates were identified based on cultural, morphological and biochemical characteristics. The in-vitro antibiotic susceptibility patterns of some of the isolates were determined by the disc diffusion method. A total of 68 bacterial isolates were recovered from the swabs and blood samples. 56 of the isolates cultured were recovered from swab samples averaging 3.73 bacterial per swab while the remaining 12 isolates were from blood of 12 patients positive upon culture averaging a bacterium per blood sample. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant organisms recovered and accounted for 74.0% of the total staphylococci encountered while coagulase negative staphylococci (CONS) accounted for 26.0%.	Other gram-positive organisms encountered were streptococcus sp (9.0%), Bacillus (I5.0%) andCorynebacterium sp (4.4%). Gram-negative rods were also cultured with Proteus sp (16.1%) leading followed by  psedomonas aeruginos and Haemophilus influenzae (7.3%) each, Klebsiella sp. (6.0%) and Citrobacter sp. (1.4%). The in-vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing of selected bacterial isolates showed that most of them were multiply resistant to the various antibiotics employed.The study shows that Staphylococcus aureus is the predominant isolate associated with acute otitis media in this environment. The study reveals multiple
antibiotic resistance among isolates, which may indicate ineffectiveness of these drugs in the event of an epidemic. The study suggests prompt diagnosis and treatment of acute otitis media to avoid possible sequalae, which may lead to morbidity in the patients.|Theses Collection|Acute Otitis Media/paediatry/antibiotic/mannitol salt agar/eosin methylene blue agar/blood agar/morphological and biochemical characteristics/disc diffusion/ method/Staphylococcus aureus/coagulase negative staphylococci/Proteus sp/psedomonas aeruginos/ Haemophilus influenzae/Corynebacterium sp/patients/Bacillus/Klebsiella sp    *||||||Olusa, Henry Kolawole|M|Numerical methods for boundary integral equations||||||M.Sc.

Both integral equations and methods for solving them come in many forms. The objective was to consider some selected methods, which are: the collocation method, the method of least squares (combined with Trapezoidal and Simpson's rule), the method of weighting functions and the direct method, and subsequently apply them to obtain approximate solutions to certain classes of (first and second kinds Fredholm and Volterra) integral equations.To achieve this, numerical quadrature, which is the basis of every numerical method was introduced and relationship between differential and integral equations was illustrated with an example. Existence and uniqueness of solutions were proved analytically. Numerical examples were given to illustrate each method. Convergence and stability of the methods were investigated both theoretically and numerically. Comparison of methods was done by obtaining the maximum error from the known exact solutions and evaluated approximate solutions.Algorithms were developed for solving the linear system of equations resulting from the methods with FORTRAN Language programming techniques. With these algorithms, the numerical performance and reliability of each method were investigated.This investigation showed that the collocation method is most reliable, stable and simple to use.|Theses Collection|Integral equations/collocation method/Simpson's rule/weighting functions/Fredholm and Volterra integral equations/differential equation/algorithms*||||||Omoleke, Ishaq Ishola|M|Inter-Governmental relations and management of primary health care in Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Public Administration|Samuel Bamidele Ayo||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Public Administration|2000|||OAU|||||xvii,258p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The study covered the period between 1988 and 1999.Both primary and secondary sources of data were employed for the study. The primary sources of data included information generated from a questionnaire survey, interviews and participant observation while the secondary sources of data were collected from hospital and medical records, government documents, bibliographical studies and immunization records. Data gathered from both primary and secondary sources were analysed using quantitative and descriptive methods. In particular, Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software was used.The findings of the study showed that there was a low level of interaction among the three tiers of government in Nigeria, and this has affected intergovernmental dimensions of the management of the PHC system in the zone. The PHC programme was grossly underfunded. This underfunding, manifested in the low performance of the PI-1C delivery facilities across all levels of government. Furthermore, the research findings showed that there were some inherent institutional impediments such as conflicts between local and state governments resulting in a strained relationship, poor collaboration and weak linkage between them.The study also observed that community participation in the PHC programme which was a sine qua non in the attainment of the objectives of the programme was very low. The participation of international organizations such as UNICEF and USAID in PHC implementation in Nigeria was responsible for most of the achievements made so far.The study concluded among others that the three tiers of government must relate to one another to ensure that a harmonious relationship existed at all times through official interactions on all issues that affected the three levels of government, especially the policy formulation and implementation of PHC. To this end, there was need to re-visit the parameters used for the distribution of revenue from the federation account among the three levels of government to ensure harmonious financial relationships. Finally, there was need for all levels of government to be more committed to the faithful implementation of settled policies in order to avoid the problem of failed policies.|Theses Collection|Inter-governmental relations/immunization/statistical package for socials sciences (SPSS) software/policy/UNICEF/USAID/federation account  *||||||Omotosho, Sunday|M|Woro: A musical genre of Indigenous Yoruba people of Lagos State||||||M.A. Music|A.

Careful materials selection is therefore paramount to enhance the durability, safety in use, efficiency, and also the aesthetics of the product. The growth in materials technology has resulted in the progressive development of new materials. This has vastly expanded the number of possibilities deserving serious considerations, thus resulting in most of the problems encountered in the materials selection process. The objective of this work is to develop materials selection database software. This is expected to effectively manage materials property data to minimise some of these problems.The systems approach to materials selection was adhered to in the development of the materials selection software. It was designed using the "Microsoft Access", a relational database package. Data on material properties were sourced from journals, textbooks, handbooks and other literature. They were utilized in the development of the databank by grouping the data collected into different subjects. These include the `mechanical property', `physical property', `materials history', `materials' data etc. These corresponded to the different tables within the databank. Relationship was established between the tables. This facilitated the development of the queries and their corresponding filters. The filters obtained in the dynasets correspond to the list of the best materials for the different application.The database software obtained was able to effectively process materials property data into a material property databank from which desired information about materials can be easily retrieved. It also enhanced the material selection process by making available the various materials presently in use for the selector's consideration. This resulted in the avoidance of the risk of overlooking of some possible candidate materials. Thus minimizing some of the problems encountered when journals, literatures, textbooks and handbooks' consultation is utilized. It is also cost ad time effective because expensive process simulation, which is often inaccurate and time consuming, is avoided. Hence the adoption of the software for materials selection will improve the ease of selection, accuracy in selection while simultaneously rendering the materials selection process cost and, time effective.|Theses Collection|Design and production/durability/aesthetics/databasesoftware/Microsoft Access/dynasets/databank/*||||||Oyebayo, David Olasunkanmi|M|Attitute to work and alienation as correlates of academic performance among undergraduate students of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife||||||M.A. Guidance and Counselling|K.A.

The specific objectives are: (i) design and fabrication of laboratory-scale combustion chamber suitable for monitoring of the combustion process and (ii) evaluation and comparison of combustion efficiency, burning mode and pollutant emission characteristics of the briquetted and non-briquetted forms of sawdust.The methodology adopted for the study involved: (i) the production of sawdust briquettes, (ii) design and fabrication of combustion chamber, (iii) combustion of sawdust in both the briquetted and non-briquetted forms, (iv) sampling of some pollutants namely Carbon dioxide (CO2), Carbon monoxide (CO), Total Suspended Particulate (TSP), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) generated in the experimental combustion chamber using a state - of - the art combination of direct reading pollutant emission analyses systems, gravimetry and wet chemical methods and (v) data analysis involving calculations of emission factors, emission ratios and combustion efficiencies for the various samples. Level of emissions in the exhaust was investigated by the on-line use of a NDIR analyzer (BINOS 1001 model) for CO/CO2 connected to a paramagnetic 02 analyzer (OXYNOS 100 model) and a membrane filtering air pump via a stainless steel probe. An Aztec low-volume air sampler was simultaneously used for the collection of TSP on Whatman 2 cm filter papers while NOx and SO2 were collected in special absorption reagent in fritted bubblers sampling absorption bottles. The CO/CO2 sampling system gave real-time concentration of CO and CO2, which were then time-averaged. NOx measurement was obtained by the Saltzman's method while SO2 measurements were carried out by the Hydrogen Peroxide/Conductivity method. The TSP was measured by the gravimetric techniques. The exhaust emission temperature was continuously monitored by the use of a chromel-alumel thermocouple embedded in the hood of the combustion chamber.Results were obtained for overall emission parameters (that is, emission ratios, combustion efficiencies and emission factors) from the combustion of the sawdust test samples. Emission factors were obtained for the monitored pollutants CO2, CO, TSP, SO2 and NON on the basis of the prevailing phase of combustion. Emission ratios for CO normalized with respect to CO2, and combustion efficiency, which is a measure of how effective the combustion process was, were also obtained for the two distinct phases of combustion, that is - smouldering and flaming phases of combustion. As a case study, the emission factor data generated in this work was applied for the prediction of the air pollution generated at the OkoBaba Sawmill Complex of South East Lagos. On that basis, the pollutant emissions in the Sawmill Complex were estimated respectively as: CO2 (7.3 X 108 kg/year), CO (1.3.x 108 kg/year), TSP (1990 kg/year), NOx (9180 kg/year) and SO2 (164,100 kg/year). On the basis of combustion phase, the generated effluent gas CO2, was estimated to be 1.3 x 108 kg/year and 6.0 x 108 kg/year respectively for the smouldering and flaming combustion phases respectively. A generation rate of 3.6 x 107 kg/year and 1.0 x 108 kg/year respectively for smouldering and flaming combustion phases was estimated for CO. The findings of this study imply that briquetting of sawdust increases the combustion efficiency of its burning process; tilts the combustion mode in favour of flaming rather than smouldering, and generally reduces the percentage of ashes and residues left after burning. Pyrolysed briquettes and charred briquettes are recommended as alternative forms in which sawdust can be effectively utilized as useful sources of energy with limited emission of hazardous pollutants.|Theses Collection|Sawdust/smouldering/flaming/combustion efficiencies/paramagnetic 02 analyzer/ hydrogen peroxide/air pump/filter/OkoBaba Sawmill Complex of South East Lagos/briquetting/ashes/residue/gravimetry/NDIR analyzer/Whatman 2 cm filter papers/Saltzman's method *||||||Salami, Shakirat Oluwatoyin|F|Educational resources and students' Academic performance in selected secondary schools in Osun State||||||M.A. Educational Administration|M.A. Adelabu||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obfemi Awolowo University, Educational Administration|2000|||OAU|||||ix,103p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Data were collected from one hundred and twenty respondents through the use of questionnaires. The respondents are the Principals, Vice Principals, Heads of Departments and Guidance Counselors of selected schools. Related documents connected with the available human and physical resources of each school were examined. On the spot inspection and assessment of the existing physical facilities were also carried out and the available ones were quantified and analysed. Descriptive analysis and Pearson Product Correlation Co-efficient were used to analyse the data. The findings revealed that educational resources influenced students academic performance positively. There was inadequate provision of educational resources in secondary schools in Osun State. However, it was found that there were more human resources for Arts and Social Science subjects than for Science and Vocational subjects. There was lack of uniformity in the provision of human and physical resources such as the number of available teachers for the various subjects, the available buildings, furniture and audio-visual aids. It can be concluded from the study that secondary schools in Osun State were not well funded and this constituted a barrier to the attainment of goals and objective of secondary school education.|Theses Collection|Educational resources/Guidance Counselors/Pearson Product Correlation Co-efficient/teachers/furniture and audio-visual aids/buildings/funding*||||||Uthman, Ibrahim Olatunde|M|An Investigation of the status of Muslim women in Ibadan and its environs||||||M.A. Religious Studies|E.O.

Oral interviews were conducted with various Muslim scholars and leaders especially women. Relevant texts from the Qur'an, Sunnah, practices of the companions of the Prophet and views of leading orthodox and contemporary Islamic scholars were also cited to show the real status of Muslim women in Islam.At the end, the results of the research indicated that the conditions of Muslim women in general in the areas of study are not in line with the ethics and teachings of Islam. It also revealed that there is no marked difference between the views of most of the respondents and interviewees and the basic teachings of Islam on how the status of Muslim women can be improved upon. It however identified ignorance of the authentic teachings of Islam as the major factor responsible for the unpalatable and sordid state of Muslim women today.In the same vein, the research observed that major steps are already being taken by the Federation of Muslim Women Association in Nigeria (FOMWAN) to improve upon the status of Muslim women.

Also chromosomes from the salivary glands were studied. The four species were Simulium alcocki Pomeroy, Simulium damnosum Theobald sensu stricto and two yet to be identified species of Simulium herein referred to as US1 (unidentified species 1) and US 2 (unidentified species 2) .These studies were carried out with the aim of determining the diploid chromosome number and describing the gross morphology of the mitotic chromosomes, and also to utilize the banding patterns of the polytene chromosomes for species characterization.A diploid number (2n) of 6 was obtained for all species of blackfly studied. The results were obtained from the ganglia dissected from penultimate to final larval instars. The ganglia were fixed in 1:3 glacial acetic acid ethanol, hydrolysed in 45% acetic acid and squashed in FLP orcein (Formic acid, Lactic acid and Propionic acid) for 10-15 minutes.A new method for preparing mitotic chromosomes from the supraoesophageal ganglia was developed. This involved placing the fixed paired supraoesophageal ganglia in 2.5% Hydrochloric acid for 1-2 seconds and staining in FLP orcein for 10-15minutes. It has the advantage of reducing the thickness of the preparation due to the action of the hydrochloric acid which dissolves away more of the surrounding tissue around the chromosomes and reduces, to a large extent, the undesirable principle of parallax (due to the unevenness of the preparation, all the chromosomes do not come into focus at the same level).Idiograms were constructed for all the four species studied. Chromosomes 1 and 3 were nearly submedian (-) while chromosome 2 was nearly median for S. alcocki. For S. damnosum, chromosome 1 was median, while chromosome 2 was nearly median, and 3 was nearly submedian (-). For Simulium species (US 1) all chromosomes were nearly submedian (-) while for Simulium species (US 2) all chromosomes were nearly median. Polytene chromosomes were observed in all species from the salivary glands. There is no chromocentre, and all the three chromosomes are discrete in the four species studied. Features such as puffs, short sections of asynapsis and inversions could be identified. Salivary gland polytene chromosomes of Simulium species (US 2) were extremely fragile and hence proved difficult to handle. From the results of this study, one can conjecture that blackfly species may be conclusively identified using the larval and pupal morphological characteristics as well as its karyotype and banding pattern.|Theses Collection|Karyotype/mitotic chromosomes/supraoesophageal ganglia/Simulium alcocki Pomeroy/Simulium damnosum Theobald sensu stricto/larval instars/salivary glands/ Polytene chromosomes/pupal/Simulium species *||||||Olurankinse, Olanipekun|M|Ogbon-Isotan Imunimotele ninu Iwe Itan aroso Yoruba||||||Ph.D. Yoruba Language and Literature|T.M.

It also set out to analyse the various ways in which they are used.The research method involved the consultation of library and archival materials on the novels and prognosis. Selected Yoruba novels of writers such as Fagunwa, Ogundele, Okediji and Akinlade were studied so as to identify the writers' use of the narrative technique of prognosis. The features thus identified were analysed within the frame-work of the literary theory of structuralism.In all the works examined, about eleven different elements - called prognostics - were indicated. These were prognostic name or cognomen, idea of decorum, characteristic, position, protagonist, setting, dream, hint, heading, symbol and singularity.The utility of the narrative technique of prognosis was also examined comparatively in the English and Yoruba literatures. While its use in today's "higher written literature" of the English society has apparently been discarded, the Yoruba society still cherishes its use in its contemporary literature. The relative underdevelopment of the literary culture among the Yoruba and the permissive nature of the Yoruba language of its use might have accounted for the difference.|x,105p|||||||Yoruba||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The subjects were thereafter randomly assigned to experimental and control groups with 36 subjects in each group. The experimental group was exposed to pastoral counselling treatments twice a week, for four weeks and for one hour per session. The control group received no treatment.	The same research instrument (i.e. FSI) was administered again on both groups as post-test, after the therapy. The data collected from the administration of the research instrument were analysed using t-test statistics Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).The significance of the statistics was considered at 0.05 level of probability. The pre-test of both the experimental and control groups which revealed their initial level of fear of supernatural forces prior to the treatment revealed a t-value of 0.069 which was not significant at the 0.05 level of probability t(df=71.p > 0.05). This proved that the two groups had equivalent level of fear of supernatural forces before the treatment. A statistical test of significance between the post-treatment means of fear of supernatural forces of the experimental group and the pre-test value of the same group revealed a t-value of 14.2 which was significant at 0.05 level of probability t(df=7/.p < 0.05). This proved that the experimental treatment had a significant effect on the level of fear of supernatural forces of the subjects. A further statistical comparison of the pre-test mean value of the control group and the post-test of the same group revealed a t- value of 0.25. This confirmed that the significant at 0.05 level of probability t(df=71.p)O.O5)This confirmed that the significant result of the experimental group was as a result of the pastoral counselling treatment given to them.It was, therefore, confirmed that pastoral-counselling was effective in the reduction of the fear of supernatural forces of church goers.The post-test treatment mean of fear of supernatural forces of the experimental group was also analysed to show the significant effect of pastoral counselling on variable like sex, age and marital status of members in the church. The result revealed that there was no significant difference in the effect of pastoral counselling on the fear of super-natural forces on polygynists and monogamists in the church t(df=11.p> 0.05). It was also found that age did not significantly affect the efficacy of pastoral counselling on the fear of supernatural forces of church goers t(df=2.33.p 0.05). It was further revealed that there was no significant difference in the effect of pastoral counselling on The fear of supernatural forces on male and female members of the church t(df =17. p > 0.05) .Conclusively, the findings of this study suggest that the need to incorporate and intensify pastoral counselling in the curriculum of seminaries, encourage counselling seminars for pastors and church leaders and establish a functional pastoral counselling in the churches.|Theses Collection|Pastoral counselling/fear/supernatural forces/church goers/age and marital status/Anglican Churches in Ikire/polygynists/monogamists/counselling seminars/church leaders*||||||Ajao, Olajide Abraham|M|Production risk and resource-use efficiency among the participants of the women-in-agriculture programme of the Oyo State agricultural development project||||||M.Sc.

The study made use of a combination of time series and cross-sectional data One hundred each of participants and non-participants in the Women-In-Agriculture (WIA) programme were randomly chosen using a multi-stage sampling technique from two zones, namely, Ogbomoso and Oyo zones of the state ADP. Two out of the four zones of the state ADP were randomly chosen as a first stage while fifty women participants each from the two zones were randomly chosen given a total of hundred and equal number of non-participating women farmers were also randomly selected given a total of two hundred respondents.The regression function of output variance on input showed that seed, rent, labour and fertilizer used exhibited a positive marginal variance effect on the output. However, fertilizer use was the only statistically significant variable at the 5 percent level Also. the result of the regression function of the production function revealed that for the participants. all the variables had positive coefficients out of which rent, labour and fertilizer were statistically significant at the 5 percent level. The technical efficiency indices were computed using the Ordinary Least Square technical efficiency frontier and the relationship between these efficiency indices and farm size was sought using a Spearman rank correlation. Though a weak relationship was observed between the farm size and technical efficiency indices for both groups. the relationship was however, statistically significant at the 5 percent level for non-participants suggesting that an increase in farm size will increase their level of technical efficiency The non-significance of the relationship between farm size and technical efficiency for participants suggested that they were operating at a technically optimal level which might not significantly affect the efficiency of the operation.The Kendall Tau's coefficient of concordance was used to determine if there was an agreement in the average ranking of the constraints between the participants and non-participants in each zone. It was observed that there was an agreement in the average ranking for both groups in the two zones as the degree of association was significantly different from zero at the 5 percent level. Hence the most critical constraints for the two groups were high cost of inputs, weed problem and distance from market while lack of storage facilities, shortage of agrochemicals and land tenure constituted the least critical problems.|Theses Collection|Production risk/Oyo State Agricultural Development Project/labour and fertilizer/farm size/technical efficiency/Kendall Tau's coefficient of concordance/distance from market/storage facilities/agrochemicals/land tenure*||||||Ajewole, John Olugbenga|M|The methods of teaching music in Nigerian junior secondary schools in Ibadan municipality||||||M.A. Music|O.O.

The main purpose of this study was to survey the different methods of teaching music in selected junior secondary schools in Ibadan, to proffer solutions to the major problems confronting methods of teaching music, and to suggest appropriate methods for effective teaching of music at the junior secondary school (JSS) level. The rationale is based on discovering the factors accounting for the current state of music education in Nigerian schools.A survey of the methods of teaching music was conducted in five schools. Four hundred and fifty (450) junior secondary school (3) students and eight (8) music teachers were used for the study. Oral interviews were conducted with the teachers concerned and known authoritiesnthefieldf music education in Nigeria. Classroom observation on the teaching of music was carried out in each of the selected schools. Questionnaires were directly administered to the students and teacher(s) of the schools concerned.The outcome of the study showed that the music teachers in the selected schools did not depend on a wide variety of methods for instruction. The scope of the teaching methods utilized in the schools concerned was narrow. Only eight of the twenty teaching methods mandatory for quality music education were applied. The eight teaching methods applied in these schools were itemized as follows: Class/collective method, Lecture or Telling method.questioning method, Assignment: method, Discussion method, Demonstration method, Story telling and Individual method. Most of these methods were applied wrongly. The students however were satisfied with their teacher(s) methods of teaching music and had good attitude towards learning of music. The study also found that, musical instruments, teaching materials and facilities were inadequate for music instruction and contributed to the problems confronting the methods of teaching music.The thesis concluded that the situation of music teaching in the schools concerned demands urgent remedy based on the empirical findings, and there is a bright future for music education, if adequate facilities/equipment is provided for the selected schools. Recommendations for improvement included requests for better stalling and adequate facilities for the schools concerned.|Theses Collection|Music/methods for instruction/Class/collective method/Lecture or Telling method/Demonstration method/musical instruments/aequate facilities/equipment *||||||Ajibade, Adewole|M|Effects of audio-taped instructional package in teaching Oral English on students'performance in the schools of science in Osun State of Nigeria ||||||M.A. Educational Technology|D.K.

Multistage and simple random sampling techniques were used to select a total of eight "Blocks", forty villages and two hundred and forty women farmers, using pre-tested and validated structured interview schedule between September, 1998 and March, 1999.Majority (98%) of the women were full-time farmers whose average age was 45 years, with low level of education, but well travelled within their social environment and participated in one social organization or the other. Majority (95%) of them grew arable crops, and only 7% claimed ownership of the land they used, with mean farm size of 0.44 hectare. The women farmers spent an average of 12 hours per day on the farm. The annual income of the respondents was below N10, 000. The women farmers lacked access to credit facilities and new farm inputs. Only 16% of the women farmers had ever had contact with the WIA agents once or twice since the inception of the programme. The level of effectiveness of the programme was low, with a mean score of 2.43 and standard deviation of 1.42. The result of the Lorenz curve shows that the respondents did not feel equally the impact of the WIA programme.  About thirteen women related, three community related, and four programme related factors were identified as influencing the effectiveness of WIA programme in Ondo State, at P< 0.05 level of significance. These include participation in social organization (r=0.487), activities engaged in on crop productions (r=0.601), number of training had with the women agents (r0.422), number of advisory services had on cooperative groups/societies (r=0.540) and numbers of Small Plot Adoption Techniques practices had by the women(r=0.441). Others are compatibility (r=0.910), profitability 0.910), relative advantage (r=0.930), and communicability (r=0.516) of WIA programme, number of community leaders (r=0.221), community attitude towards women (r=0.211), and numbers of women leaders in the community (r=0.199).Hence, the order of influence of factors of effectiveness based on the correlation coefficient analysis is programme related factors, followed by women farmers' socio-economic characteristics and community related factors.|Theses Collection|Women-In-Agriculture programme/rural women/level of education/social organization/ownership of the land/arable crops/farm size/community leaders/communicability/ small plot adoption techniques *||||||Akalonu, Ogechi Immaculeta|F|Development and evaluation of  a weaning food based on malted maize and a mixture of germinated cowpea and sesame seed||||||M.Sc.

Plant protein sources have been found attractive both in cost and availability. The process of germination has been shown to improve the nutrient characteristics of grain. Consequently, it was applied in this study to develop a safe and acceptable weaning food with low water holding capacity, low viscosity and increased nutrient content.Experiments were conducted to formulate a weaning food from germinated grains. Germination period of 72 and 48 hours were applied for the cereals, legume and sesame seed respectively. The germinated grains were dried at a temperature not exceeding 45°C, milled and formulated as follows: Maize (60%), cowpea (20%), defatted sesame flour (10%) and micronutrients (10%). Defatted sesame flour was added to augment for methionine and cysteine while cowpea was added for lysine, since maize is deficient in essential amino acids. The product was evaluated for microbial safety, sensory attributes, proximate composition, physico-chemical properties, micronutrients and animal feeding trials. The data obtained were compared with those of Nutrend as control diet.The protein, fat, ash and carbohydrate content were 19.04%, 6.2%, 2.50% and 62.30% respectively. The diet was not significantly different (P>0.05) from the control in terms of the properties evaluated. Similarly the bioassay parameters: growth response, protein efficiency ratio (PER), net protein retention (NPR) and faecal nitrogen were not significantly different (P>0.05) from those of the control diet.

It also investigates the linkages that exist among Industrial establishments at the Complex. The work investigates the factors that have contributed to the development and growth of the Apapa Industrial complex. It also finds out how an Industrial complex evolved in the region, the existence of linkages between the seaport and the Industrial Complex and the problems that are faced by the two economic activities as a result of their interdependence.The Apapa Industrial area was divided into seven segments and sysmatic sampling of one hundred and four large establishments covering the entire seven segments was carried out to obtain relevant data to achieve the objective of the study. Data were also collected from the Nigerian Port Authority specifically in respect of Industrial raw material shipment through the Lagos harbour between 1975 and 1995. Data were also obtained from the Shippers Council as per the destination of goods arriving at the Apapa port from outside the country. Data tabulation was used to indicate the freight flow between the seaport and the Apapa Industrial Complex. A flow analysis was used to ascertain the level of flow of goods from the port to other parts of Nigeria and to Lagos as compared with flow of goods into areas within Apapa. The findings reveal that 84.6% of the establishments located in the area are there to enjoy services offered by the seaport. Industrial establishments started to be attracted to the site after the Port witnessed some development in 1913 and 1918 pointing to the fact that the presence of Industrial Estate in the area prior to the development of the Apapa port has played little or no role at attracting Industrial establishments to the site.It was discovered that 82% of the Industrial raw materials imported through the port were processed at industries located close to the port or stored in warehouses around the port site for onward transmission.The Apapa port is not only used for the importation of materials; seven of the sampled establishments transport goods from different regions of Nigeria to the industrial site through the seaport. Ninety Seven of the sampled establishments also use the seaport for the importation of raw materials rather than the exportation of industrial products.|Theses Collection|Apapa seaport/Industrial establishment/Nigerian Port Authority/Industrial raw material shipment/Shippers Council/freight flow/Apapa Industrial Complex/warehouses/importation of materials/transportation of goods/exportation of industrial products *||||||Akinsola, Peter Moronkeji|M|A comparison of the performance of Direct entry and University matriculation examination students in the Education degree programme of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife||||||M.A. Test and Measurement|E.R.I.

The primary objective was to determine whether or not the mode of entry into the education degree programme of the University, affects the academic performance of students both in specific aspects of the programme and in the over-all degree performance.Students admitted through University Matriculation Examination into part one in the Faculty of Education at the beginning of 1993/94 and those admitted through D.E. at the beginning of 1995/96 sessions constituted the population for the study. The sample was made up 351 students. These were those with complete academic results for three consecutive sessions (1995/96, 1996/97, 1997/98). Their results were obtained and analysed for the study. The raw scores of each student in the Teaching Practice during the 1995/96 and 96/97 (i.e. Part II and III), and in Education Core Courses and Teaching subjects during each of 1995/96, 1996/97 and 97/98 sessions were collected from the respective departments. Grade Point Average (G.P.A.) was derived from these raw scores for each subject and for the sessions indicated. The Cumulative Grade Point Average (C.G.P.A) at the end of the degree programme and for all the three aspects of the programme combined  (Teach Practice, Education Core Courses and Teaching Subjects) was also computed for each subject. The mean scores for the two study groups (U.M.E. and D.E students) were compared. for each of the three seasons (1995/96, 96/97, 97/98) and for the overall performance at the end of the programme - the C.G.P.A. The statistical significance of all tests was determined at 0.05 level.The results of data analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the academic performance of students admitted through U.M.E. and D.E. in their teaching subjects in each session. However, there was significant difference (t = 3.5, t = 5.2, t = 4.0), in the academic performance of U.M.E. and D.E. students in Education Core Courses during each of the sessions in the study with students admitted through D.E. having a better performance in each session. The results of the study also showed that students admitted through D.E. performed significantly better (t = 2.3, t = 2.6) than those admitted through U.M.E. in teaching practice. The study demonstrated further that both the UME and Direct entry students did not differ significantly in overall academic performance. Additional finding showed that more students admitted through the UME had extra semesters to complete their degree programmes than students admitted through the direct entry. Based on these findings it was concluded that the background Education experience of students prior to University degree tends to influence their performances only in the professional aspects of education degree programme (Teaching Practice, Education Core Course).|Theses Collection| Direct Entry students/University Matriculation Examination (UME) students/academic performance/teaching practice/grade point average (G.P.A.)/Cumulative Grade Point Average (C.G.P.A)/semesters/Education Core Courses *||||||Akpere, Lucky Patrick|M|Occurrence, Inheritance and effects of wattle on the reproductive and growth performances of West African Dwarf (WAD) goats||||||M.Sc.

Records on incidence of wattle and production performance of 1407 WAD goat kids sired by 20 bucks mated to a total of 199 does and records of 812 kiddings over a period of 15 years (1982-1997) obtained from the Goat Unit of the Teaching and Research Farm, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, in the humid tropics of Nigeria were utilized for these analyses.The production performance evaluated include: age at first kidding, gestation length, kidding interval, generation interval, litter size at birth, litter size at weaning, pre-weaning mortality, fertility index, incidence of multiple birth, incidence of apparent abortion, annual reproductive rate, birth weight, weaning weight, 6-month, 9-month and I2-month body weights. Data analysis and test of significance was by Studentst and Chi-square tests.Wattle in WAD goats is conditioned by a dominant autosomal gene with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. The development of wattle requires the cooperation of other factors (probably genes). Matings between non-wattled parents produced 18 wattled offspring. Unilaterally wattled animals are not heterozygotes but rather, unilateral wattles are due to variable penetrance and expressivity of the wattle gene.The gene frequency for the presence of wattle, W = 0.45 and that of its allele for the absence of wattle, w = 0.55. Most of the wattled animals were heterozygotes. Presence or absence of wattle did not exert significant effect (p>0.05) on all the traits studied except pre-weaning mortality, birth weight and 9-month body weight. Wattled kids have significantly lower (p<0.05) pre-weaning mortality, are significantly heavier at birth and at 9 months. Selection of wattled kids as future parents could result in heavier birth weight, reduced pre-weaning mortality and improved post-weaning growth rate which has a direct bearing on profitability.|Theses Collection|Gene frequency/mode of inheritance/West African Dwarf (WAD) goats/incidence of wattle/production performance/gestation length/kidding interval/litter size at birth/pre-weaning mortality/fertility index/annual reproductive rate/wattle gene/heterozygotes/penetrance/autosomal gene*||||||Aladejana, Francisca Olusegun|F|Botanical and cytogenic studies of some indigenous species in the A-Genome complex of the genus Oryza Linn||||||Ph.D. Botany|J.O.

Four species (0. longistaminata, O. barthii, 0. glaberrima and O. sativa) were found to occur abundantly in the wild or under cultivation (only O. sativa is cultivated). Accessions of these rice species were collected. characterized and studied for their agrobotanical attributes, species relationship, population dynamics and potentials as genetic resourcesfor the improvement of the rice crop. Crosses were made in all possible combinations among the species and the resulting hybrids were advanced to the F2, BC1F1, BC1F2 for genetic and chromosomal studies. Proximate analysis was carried out on the accessions to determine their food values.0. longistaminata is endemic in river banks and fadamas in Bida-Badeggi (Niger State) and Jebba (Kwara State). This species occurs alongside 0. sativa and O. glaberrima thus creating a necessary condition for natural hybridization which has been documented in this study.The morphological variations identified in this study have confirmed O. barthii, O. sativa, O. longistaminata and O. glaberrima as distinct species. The interspecific hybrids are generally sterile inspite of the modal chromosome association of 1211 except for the O. glaberrima X O. barthii F1 which was fertile and segregated for classical Mendelian ratios in some characters monitored in the F2 population. Fertility was progressively restored in backcrosses with marked variation in the fertility of the BC1F1 plants indicating that fertility may be under genetic control. The observation of diagnostic chromosomal associations and phenomena suggests the involvement of chromosomal mechanisms in the reproductive isolation of members of the A-genome complex.Genetic studies revealed that awning, ligule type, and long sterile lemma are under monogenic control: ripened hull colour and sensitivity to photoperiod fit the complementary gene interaction model; leaf pubescence is controlled by duplicate genes in the recessive condition while the rhizomatous habit in 0. longistaminata is recessive.Biological analyses showed that prolificacy is more important than density in determining the drooping panicle type in O. barthii; that the energy partitioned to the hull is taken from the total energy pool; that sensitivity to photoperiod causes a reduction of below-ground biomass, tiller number and tiller height but spikelet size is not affected.The population dynamics worked out for the A-genome complex highlights the roles of hybridization and introgression. The phylogenetic relationship proposed is that all the species arose from a putative parent with O. barthii as the progenitor of O. glaberrima.The study has identified agronomic attributes that may be useful as genetic resources in wild rice. These attributes include photoperiod neutrality, long grains, awnlessness, dense panicle, early emergence of seeds, high yield, high food value and early maturity. DTPMFe+ is an enriched germplasm which has been selected for these vital attributes.

Four physical factors were considered the equation, namely: the slope factor, the soil-water relationship factors of infiltration/permeability rates and field capacity and a fourth factor, which is ground surface roughness affecting the velocity of overland flow. The equation itself expresses a ratio of the relationship between a set of data in the database and a set of reference conditions empirically tested and found to be efficient for stream water quality protection.To generate the spatial data for the four factors a topographic map and satellite image have been considered. The key data from the topographic map was the contour and steam network layers. The study transformed the contour from its original vector mode to raster mode for the creation of a digital elevation model which facilitated relief slicing into sones and calculating slope values for the land units. The stream network layer of the topographic map was used for hierarchical ordering of the segments into first, second and third orders, thereby using the result a input map for the buffering operation.The concept of overland flow of rain-fed surface water discharge was considered in relation to ground surface permeability, which in turn is related to infiltration and field capacity of the soil. Therefore surface permeability zones were mapped using the land cover as the indicator. Two major land covers were perceived to be co-determinant of ground surface permeability, these were Built-up and Non-built-up. Whereas the former connotes ground surface; the latter is seen as open spaces of largely uncompacted soils of the natural surfaces As the permeability status of the latter depends largely on the texture of the soils, surface soil sampling for textural classification and determination of infiltration rates and field capacity were undertake. The ground surface roughness factor was quantitatively derived using observations reported in published hydrological studies in relation to the land cover types and conditions interpreted from the satellite imagery. The database was queried to reconstruct new relationships for the creation of factor maps, which could serve as input layers for spatial analysis by the overlay approach. Eventually the relational tables were used for the calculation of the appropriate buffer widths for the stream segments. The calculated buffer widths served two purposes, one as an input for deriving the buffer effectiveness ratios, and rating of the ratios into relative effectiveness classes; the other as input for generating the buffer layer. This layer was enriched visually by overlaying the satellite image, the DEM in hill-shaded angular view, the topographic map layers of roads, the UTM grid, and some place names. The outcome has been a buffer image map, showing the buffered zone in the spectral colours of the satellite image with a background of the hill-shaded view of the DEM. The riparian buffer can serve the functions of saving the life and quality of the head streams, and preserving green zones within the city's landscape. Ibadan's housing spraw can be effectively checked with vegetative buffers, but the buffer widths would need to be determined beaning in mind the physical and ecological consideration.|Theses Collection|Riparian Buffer Delineation Equation/infiltration/permeability rates/field capacity/topographic map/satellite image/network layers/overland flow/Built-up and Non-built-up land covers/soil texture/buffer effectiveness ratios/UTM grid*||||||Akintide, Folajoye Adebukola|M|Gender consciousness in Efua Sutherland's plays||||||M.A. Literature in English|M.E.M.

This, it was argued, hitherto had been of less concern to the critics of Sutherland's plays. It also showed the significance of orality in the transformation of her dramaturgy. Her plays it was further argued, constituted a platform for propagating her womanist ideals and promoting women's empowerment: that is, how through dramatic reflection of female archetypes and folkheroines, an authentic space for women's voices is being instituted.The study concluded that Sutherland's gender concerns as shown in her plays examined were culture bound and her gender ideology was enhanced by her dialogic principles which were founded on the recognition and integration of women within the Akan cultural space and the Ghanaian social polity.|Theses Collection|Gender consciousness/orality/folkloric tradition/The Marriage of Anansewa (1975)/Edufa (1967)/historical materials/dramaturgy/female archetypes/folkheroines/Akan culture/Ghanaian social polity  *||||||Akintoye, Maroof Adeniyi|M|Comparative karyology and evolution in Muridae (Mammalia, Rodentia, Muridae)||||||M.Sc.

These are (Cricetomys emini (Wroughton) and Gerbillus agag (Thomas) of the family Cricetidae and Lophuromys sikapusi (Temminck), Rattus rattus (Linnaeus) and Rattus species belonging to the family Muridae. The studies were undertaken with the aim of determining the karyotype of each species and also of making comparison between the results of this present study and past studies from the literature; and possibly to determine the relatedness of the species.The preparations of the chromosomes were made from bone marrow of the animals treated with 0.05% colchicine. The chromosomes of well spread cells were counted directly from the slide. Photomicrographs of well spread mitotic metaphase chromosomes were made, and from this, the measurement of chromosomes and construction of a standard karyotype for each species were made. Arms ratio and centromeric indices were determined from these measurements and the chromosomes were classified based on the centromeric indices obtained.A constant chromosome complement of 2n = 76 was recorded for male Cricetomys emini, 2n = 48 for female Lophuromys sikupusi and 2n = 38 for male Rattus rattus. While the diploid chromosome complements recorded for the single species of (Gerbillus agag and Rattus species obtained are 2n = 30 and 2n = 38 respectively. The fundamental numbers (EN) obtained for Cricetomys emini, Gerbillus agag Lophuromys sikapusi, Rattus rattus and Rattus species are 77, 53, 68, 60 and 52 respectively. The karyotypes of the four genera showed high conservation typical of each genus based on their chromosome morphology and numbers. The sex chromosomes observed for all the species were well differentiated.The karyotypes of the Rattus species showed both similarities and differences in terms of chromosome morphology and size variation with that of Rattus rattus. The fundamental number (FN) of 52 obtained for the Rattus species was different from the FN of 60 recorded for Rattus rattus.

In addition it examined classroom practice in order to determine its effectiveness for achieving communicative competence.A total number of 500 subjects was used for this study. These include 50 language teachers and 450 students in the Senior Secondary Class Three. These were randomly selected from three schools in three local government areas of Osun state. The instruments used were a teacher's questionnaire that was divided into five parts to elicit response in different areas of the Language Teacher's experience. A student questionnaire and a written task on picture stories, where students chose one of the two picture stories provided and wrote on it. In addition, an oral interview was conducted for both teachers and students in order to appraise the method of teaching English Language vis-a-vis a communicative language Teaching approach use.Using frequency count, percentages and concept of average, it was found that the present English syllabus good as it seems and as rated by some Language teachers fails to spell out methods those language teachers can employ to help learners meet the set aim of West African School Certificate Examination which is communicative competence. We also found that the present methods being employed by language teachers were not helpful in the achievement of communicative competence in English by the learners.In conclusion, some suggestions on the ways of improving communicative competence are provided and such improvement can be arrived at by making available a teaching syllabus for language teachers as well as ensuring that would be teachers are exposed to various methods of presenting the English Language in a second language environment. In addition, the learners should engage in meaningful tasks during the language lessons in order to foster communicative classroom situation.|Theses Collection|Communicative competence/English Language/Teacher's experience/English Language syllabus for Nigerian Secondary Schools/West African School Certificate Examination*||||||Adebowale, Adekunle|M|Biosystematic studies in four suffrutescent species of Cassia Linn||||||M.Sc.

Plants were raised from seeds to maturity and characterized using leaf, floral, fruit and seed morphological features, hybridization, chromatography and electrophoresis.Flowering periods overlapped in the natural sympatric populations and provided opportunity for interspecific hybridization. Cassia occidentalis and the simple-leafed Cassia accession were generally close in many respects but differed in leaf form, carpel number and standard petal shape. They also showed genetic compatibility by producing fertile and vigorous F1 and F2, hybrid progenies. Chromatographic analysis of leaf phenolics showed chemical markers (secondary constituents) that are useful for distinguishing between Cassia occidentalis and the F1 hybrid of C. occidentalis and the simple- leafed Cassia. Electrophoretic analysis of the crude seed proteins distinguished each species from the other and showed the closeness of C. occidentalis and the simple-leafed accession.Cassia hirsuta, C. sophera and C. occidentalis showed greater biochemical similarity than might be expected on morphological evidence alone. Though the four species in this study share common features, Cassia obtusifolia is distinctly different from the other three at all levels of investigation conducted, thereby justifying its placement in a separate section. The possible origin of the simple-leafed accession and the question of primitive characters among Cassia is discussed. It is concluded that the simple-leafed Cassia is a variety of C. occidentalis derived possibly by a reverse mutation from the compound-leaf to the simple-leaf condition.

It asserts that the way and manner spaces are planned and used are inextricable part of the cultural system of the community in question. One objective of the study was to identify aspects of culture relevant to space planning in the core of Ede. A second objective was to determine the congruence between culture and space planning. The third objective was to identify community space planning constraints at the core area of Ede and propose strategies for their resolutionTwo hundred and fifty (250) questionnaires were administered. A combination of area sampling and systematic sampling techniques was used in selecting respondents. Issues related to the people's utilization of open spaces within the residential area, location of open spaces in relation to buildings, respondents' satisfaction levels and their perception of how to effectively plan for open spaces were incorporated in the questionnaire.The study revealed that existing community spaces in the study area, are characterized by marks of the indigenous society and very little of imported cultural traits. The findings further revealed that traditional planning of community spaces were based on socio-cultural factors and availability of land without consideration for modern planning standards and changing needs of the people. Yet, the mere provision for community space, some uses, and their locations within walking distance are in congruence with modern physical planning concepts. The study also revealed that several community spaces have been reduced or have completely disappeared due to factors such as demand for more residential and commercial plots and lack of proper physical planning control.It is recommended that a proper development plan needs to be designed for the town. There is also a need to strengthen and provide adequate funds for Planning Authorities to increase their effectiveness and efficiency, especially for planning, provision, protection and maintenance of community spaces and facilities. Following this, the gap between legal provision and actual practice needs to be bridged to facilitate easy physical planning administration and development control.|Theses Collection|Conflict/culture/planning standards in community/Yoruba land/residential area/imported cultural traits/socio-cultural factors/development plan/adequate funding/legal provision *||||||Adeleye, Margaret Olayinka|F|A feminist critical study of anonymous female characters in MARK'S Gospel and the Nigerian folklore||||||M.A. Religious Studies|C.U.

Aware of this, this thesis has attempted to reconstruct early Christian history as womens history. It has sought to recover the Christian heritage of women lost over the centuries due to overt patriarchal authorial techniques.Thus the study has been addressed to the conscious eclipse of women characters in the Gospel of Mark. To carry the Nigerian readership along my interpretative journey, the image of women in some selected Nigerian folklore was studied. This was due to the fact that the author of the Gospel of Mark as well as the authors of folklore used oral traditions in the composition of their stories. Rightly, the Markan narratives bear traits of oralture which the Nigerian folklore shares much in common. Besides, the thesis has discovered that the author of Mark and those of our local texts employ anonymity as a literary device to displace women characters.From this comparative exegesis, the thesis has discovered the need to sensitize the Nigerian womenfolk that the hiding of women characters was an androcentric literary device employed to belittle women. Thus the thesis has proposed lines of contextualizing its findings in the Nigerian contexts. It has, beside other ways, suggested that the pristine offices held by women in the early church should be restored in order to allow women have visibility in the contemporary church establishments. It has recommended that Nigerian women should come together to unite themselves in order to struggle for their rights and to eliminate all forms of feminine degradation in the church and society.|Theses Collection|Jewish and Christian scriptural and non-canonical narratives about women/western world/chauvinistic patriarchy/Nigerian folklore/oral traditions/androcentric literary device/church and society*||||||Adeniyi, Gabriel Adegboyega|M|Strategies for incorporating environmental technology management into secondary school curriculum in Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The study identified the level of unemployment and pattern of poverty problems in the state. It examined the mode operation of self-employment enterprises by highlighting their potentials for solving poverty problem in Osun State. It also evaluated the effectiveness of the activities of the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) towards poverty alleviation in Osun State.The study method involved the use of questionnaire to elicit desired information from the characteristic features of self-employment enterprises which are capable of fostering poverty alleviation in Osun State. Some secondary data on the activities of the NDE and the UNDP in Osun State were also used to analyse their potentials in poverty alleviation. Non-parametric statistics were used for the analysis.The characteristics of self-employment showed that the enterprises have potentials for employment generation. For example, the 600 surveyed enterprises created 5934 jobs as at July 1 999. The labour per unit of output was found to be high. The rate of increase of employment generation was found to be more than double in every ten years. Despite the low initial capital base of the enterprises, an amount totalling N4,305,723.50 was realised from sales of their output while N 3,510,532 was the total weekly wage paid to all categories of personnel.The entrepreneurs also invested in housing and procurement of shares and landed properties. In terms of skills development, the surveyed enterprises were able to train 7699 apprentices. A total of 2426 were undergoing training as of the interview period i.e. June to July 1999. The UNDP gave a total soft loan of N2,560.00 in assisting co-operative societies at establishing small and medium scale enterprises within the last two years. The role of NDE as a Federal government agency in Osun State at alleviating poverty shows that a total soft loan package of N13,768,228.60 was disbursed by the Osun State NDE under its various poverty alleviation schemes from 1 988 to 1999.Some of the problems of self-employment: in playing its role of generating employment and fostering poverty alleviation include inadequacy of infrastructural facilities and lack of credit facilities needed for expansion of the enterprises.In conclusion the findings suggests that the characteristics of the self-employment enterprises are comprehensive at alleviating poverty in our urban and rural areas. The provision of infrastructural facilities which is an important ingredients to the entrepreneurs for effective performance are not adequate enough. Also if necessary infrastructural facilities are provided by the government in the rural areas, the operators of self-employment enterprise will do better in alleviating poverty in our society.|Theses Collection|Self-employment/poverty alleviation/unemployment/National Directorate of Employment (NDE)/United Nations Development Programme (UNDP/skills development/small and medium scale enterprises/ *||||||Adepoju, Deborah Mojirola|F|Survey of the status of public secondary schools insurance in Oyo and Osun States of Nigeria||||||M.A. Educational Administration|U.C.

The study also examined the future prospects of insuring uninsured schools in Oyo and Osun States.Data for the study were collected from 35 randomly selected principals from each of the two States, Ministry of Education officials in the two States and representatives of seven insurance companies. The other sources of data were documents and records as well as observation of physical facilities relating to security in the schools. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics.Findings from the analysis of data revealed that only 20% of the 70 schools involved in the study had insurance scheme even though most of the schools under study had a lot of insurable property worth millions of naira. Thirteen of the insured school 92.9% were in Oyo State while only one 7.1% belonged to Osun State. Out of the 13 insured schools in Oyo State twelve were in the same area  Ogbomoso. All the twelve were insured only recently, that is, in the past three years. The insured schools were found to have taken comprehensive insurance policy. It was also discovered that non-insurance of schools was caused by lack of funds and general lack of knowledge and awareness of insurance schemes on the part of the principals.The future of insurance programme in the two States was deemed to be very bleak as there were no preparations in the schools concerning the prerequisite for buying insurance policies and for companies prerequisite for selling the policies.

Given the numerous theoretical and empirical studies existing in the literature, and the absence of such studies on the study area, a number of objectives were set. These include an examination and description of the locational pattern of social service centres as well as their patronage in Ondo town in order to identify and discuss in detail the socio-economic and other related factors that have influenced the evolution of the identified patterns; to establish a hierarchy of social service centres in the town and the possible regional planning implication (if any).Data were collected using both stratified and systematic sampling techniques. Two sets of questionnaires were prepared; the first set was administered on owners or founders of some social service centres in the town, while the second set was administered on 400 randomly selected households from the seven traditional wards in the town. The data were subsequently analyzed using simple statistical analytic techniques.The study confirmed the existing known hypothesis that with the exception of health facilities, people prefer services in their immediate environment. As a result of this, as the distance covered increases the volume of patronage of social service centres decreases. Besides location and patronage distribution, quality of service and distance to the available services, space availability are the other most important factors in the location of social service centres in the study area. As large spaces are only available in underdeveloped parts of the town, services which require large spaces are located in the periphery of the town. Those that require small spaces are more concentrated within town. The index of concentration showed that social service centres are unevenly distributed in the study area. For instance, religious and educational, institutions are more randomly distributed than the recreational and medical institutions. Also the hierarchy of social service centres patronage can be identified with Oke-Agunla ward as the first order and Enu-owa ward as the seventh order centre. The identified hierarchy can be a useful tool for urban planning in Ondo town and towns of similar size functions in Nigeria.|Theses Collection|Social service centres/pattern of patronage/regional planning/socio-economic infrastructures/index of concentration/recreational and medical institutions/*||||||Aina, Omotayo Olugbenga|M|The effect of incentive schemes on construction productivity in Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The assessment was carried out by first, identifying the incentive schemes currently used in Nigerian construction industry and their relative performance. Second, by assessing the effect of financial incentive on the productivity of bricklayers in large, medium and small sized construction firms. Third, a comparison is made between productivity of sites where incentives were used and where not used. One hundred questionnaires were administered on construction using stratified random sampling.Three of ten incentive schemes found to be relevant to the construction industry, namely Hour-saved, Day work and Plus-rate schemes are discovered to be more commonly used and preferred in Nigeria. The modified Likart statistical method was used to calculate the performance ratings. The results of the regression analysis on the effect of applied incentives on productivity of 169 bricklayers show that the applied incentives have significant effect on the increase in the number of blocks laid daily, and that the incentives also contribute 21 - 25% to the increase in the number of blocks laid per day. The result also showed that when the compared output rates between bricklayers under incentive pay and those under basic wage alone was subjected to t-test, there is a significant difference between the outputs at P = 0.001.The study finally concluded that though incentives offer a significant input to productivity increase, there are other relevant factors which will account for the remaining proportion of increase, and that incentives can be an effective tool in quickening the pace of a project threatened by time overrun, without incurring new overhead costs from employing more labour.|Theses Collection|Incentive schemes/productivity/construction industry/large, medium and small sized enterprises/Likart statistical method/overhead costs/labour  *||||||Adewumi, Babatope Isaac|M|Locus of control and religiousity as predictors of marital satisfaction among Anglican Church couples in Lagos State||||||M.A. Guidance & Counselling|K.A.

This project has therefore been designed to extract, purify and study antimicrobial agents from Lagenaria breviflora, Senna alata and Nauclea latifolia. These plants were selected because of their uses traditionally in the tropics for the treatment of various ailments ranging from skin infections to sexually transmitted diseases and tuberculosis.The crude plants extract was prepared by cold extraction. This was partially purified by bio-assay directed fractionation while the actual purification was done by chromatography and the elucidation of the structure by spectroscopy. All the extracts were examined for antimicrobially active compounds. The crude and partially purified extracts were screened for both antibacterial and antifungal activity but the purified compound was tested for antiviral activity in addition. Their probable mechanisms of action were investigated and the nature of damage done to the microbial cells assessed.Phytochemical screening of Lagenaria breviflora revealed the presence of steroids, glycosides, alkaloids, and saponins. Senna alata contained tannins anthraquinones, steroids, glycosides, alkaloids and volatile oils while Nauclea latifolia had saponins, tannins, glycosides, steroids and alkaloids. The crude extracts of Lagenaria breviflora and Nauclea latifolia exhibited weak antibacterial activity while Senna alata was mor active against  Pseudomonus putida, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Streptocuccus faecalis, Aspergillus niger, Penicillum species, Geotrichum candidum, Candida utilis and Aspergillus brevipes. The purified Lagenaria brevifloria and Nauclea latifolia were moderately active against some bacteria while Senna alata demonstrated potent antifungal and antibacterial activities. Aloe emodin, which was purified from The mechanism of antibacterial activity of the partially purified extracts of was by the leakage of protein, nucleic acid and potassium ions from the susceptible cells. The partially purified fraction (extract F) containing anthraquinones was more antibacterially potent than the steroidal quinones (extract C); it leaked more cytoplasmic materials from susceptible bacteria. Leakage of cytoplasmic materials from bacterial cells reached the peak at 120 minutes and the electron microscopic examination of the cells at maximum activity revealed that the plant extracts either lysed or mummified the bacterial cell wall. The extracts appeared to have extra advantage of killing old bacterial cells that are not very physiologically active. This investigation has clearly indicated that extracts from the flower of Senna alata, the most active of these three medicinal plants, are potential source of drugs. However, more work needs to be done on the purified extracts such as a follow-up on aloe-emodin, for which preliminary tests have revealed anti-HIV activity. In addition, the other active components in the purified extract need to be properly identified and studied. It is expected that these components could become the lead compounds in the formation of drugs to be used in the formation of drugs to be used in the control of bacteria, fungi and even HIV infections.|Theses Collection|Antibiotics/traditional medicinal/Lagenaria breviflora/Senna alata/Nauclea latifolia/bio-assay directed fractionation/chromatography/spectroscopy/Phytochemical screening/*||||||Agboola, Johnson Olugbenga|M|A study of the predicting factors in the choice of marriage partners among students of selected tertiary institutions in Osun State, Nigeria||||||M.A. Guidance & Counselling|K.A.

The subjects, whose ages ranged between 16 and 35 years, were drawn from the Federal Polytechnic, Ede, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife and Osun State College of Education, Ila-Orangun. A self-constructed inventory in the Likert form, (Choice of Marriage Partners Inventory - CMPI) was administered to collect the data for the study. The Chi-Square (X2) statistic was used to analyse the-data collected.  The results of the data analyses showed that, in order of descending magnitude, health status, religion, economic opportunity, physical attractiveness and educational attainment, were the major factors that influenced the choice of intended marriage partners among students of tertiary institutions. Significant differences existed in the factors that affected male and female students' choice of intended marriage partners. In particular, physical attractiveness was more important to males than females, while economic opportunity was rated as more important by females than males in the choice of marriage partners. |Theses Collection|Marriage/choice of partners/Likert form/Choice of Marriage Partners Inventory/health status/religion/physical attractiveness and educational attainment/economic indicators*||||||Adisa, Ademola Lateef|M|A study of pre and post-retirement experiences of ex-service men in Osun State||||||M.Sc.

The past and present life - styles of Nigerian ex-service men were examined to determine the variation(s) (if any) in their pre and post-retirement life-styles. Thus, attempts were made to establish the determinants of post-retirement welfare of the ex-service men.This study was carried out in three local government areas of Osun State, namely, Ayedaade, Ilesha West and Olorunda. The three local government areas were selected to spread across the three senatorial zones in Osun State. They were also selected to be able to have a sample that would be large enough and unbiased in favour of rural or urban areas. Both purposive and probabilistic sampling methods were used to select a sample of one-hundred and fifty ex-service men from the three local government areas. Data were collected through questionnaire survey, indepth interviews, and observations. The study revealed that of all the job characteristics that were tested, poor pay and frequent transfers were those with noticeable effects on the ex-service men in post-retirement years. Among those who did not share the belief that retirement deteriorates health, 51 percent were of the opinion that poor pay was the likely cause of their poor state of health at retirement; and of these, 3.8 percent explained that poor pay brings about poor feeding which may result in sickness and death. Also, a significant number were of the opinion that frequent transfers while in service caused many problems among which were family disintegration, increased expenditures on keeping two homes, and difficulties of enjoying long relationship with colleagues at any location. In fact, as at the study time, 3.9 percent still remained separated from their wives, 41.2 percent described their pensions as insufficient, while 62.7 percent had already taken up other jobs such as day and night watch for sustenance. It can be concluded from the findings that retirement per se does not generally lead to crises for every individual retiree. However, the experience of crises in retirement by some retirees can be attributed to a number of job characteristics, such as the level of remuneration, the frequency of transfers, and exposure to hazards, among others. |Theses Collection|Retirement experiences/ex-service men/post-retirement welfare/rural or urban areas/purposive and probabilistic sampling/health deterioration/family disintegration/ level of remuneration/frequency of transfers/exposure to hazards  *||||||Adeyemi, Remi Sikiru|M|Studies on the sorption isotherm characteristics of dehydrated tomato||||||M.Sc.

Water sorption isotherm studies were carried out using a gravimetric static method at 25, 30 and 40°C and water activity (aw) values between 0.05 and 1, 00. Five mathematical models (Oswin, Halsey, Kuhn, BET and GAB) were applied to the experimental data in order to establish the best condition for the sorption isotherms of the dried tomato samples while the thermodynamic description of sorption isotherms was made using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation as normally applied to the temperature dependence of condensing vapour. The data were correlated using the least squares regression analyses.The sorption isotherms were of the characteristic sigmoid shape. The tomato samples exhibited an increase in equilibrium moisture content (EMC) with aw. However, as temperature increased, the EMC decreased at a known aw. Among the five mathematical models used to fit the experimental data, the Halsey model was most suitable. The constants and the monolayer values for all the models were found to be temperature dependent. The monolayer values decreased as temperature increased for the GAB model. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation was found to be adequate for a qualitative thermodynamic description of the dried tomato samples in the range of temperature considered. The practical implications of the sorption study' on processing, packaging, distribution and storage of the dehydrated tomato are such as would be applicable within the temperature range in the tropical region.|Theses Collection|Dehydrated tomato/storage stability/convection air drying technique/Water sorption isotherm/Clausius-Clapeyron equation/condensing vapour/sigmoid shape/equilibrium moisture content/Halsey model/monolayer values/tropical region   *||||||Arowomole, Musibau Adeleke|M|Capital bugeting decisions in public quoted companies in Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Business Administration|L.M.

As it remains an aspect of study for evaluating the viability of future projects, its link to investment operation of public companies is highly imperative. However, this study has appraised the extent to which public companies make use of capital investment strategies for implementing long term decisions.Two types of questionnaire were designed, application of capital budgeting technique and capital budgeting behaviour in funds rationing. Data were also sourced from the Nigerian Stock Exchange in various financial statements of the companies. One hundred and five companies were randomly sampled, from various locations of the federation. Of this number ninety-four accounting staff responded to questionnaire one, while sixty-eight Finance Directors answered questionnaire two. These data were analysed using regression analysis (OLS method), percentage, standard deviation and Spearman rank order correlation matrix.The overall results of these analyses revealed the strong positive impact of dividend and taxation; shareholders' funds and share capital; total assets and profit before taxation and cash inflows as favourable determinants of growth performance, while other variables appeared unfavourable especially in the period of economic recession. It was also revealed that 94.69% of these companies generally applied payback criterion combined with Net Present Value, Accounting Rate of Return and Internal Rate of Return to measure capital investment. With regard to response on capital rationing the results revealed that:(i)	Low level of investment was importantly the outcome of a lack of demand for funds caused by lack of attractive projects but not due to shortage in the supply of finance.(ii)	Self-imposed fund constraints evolved from an unwillingness to increase borrowing and not from capital market imposed restriction.Generally, the study documented the need to evaluate growth performance prior to investment decision and capital rationing has exclusively remained the internal policy of the quoted companies. This fund rationing as a capital market phenomenon was questioned.|Theses Collection|Capital budgeting/investment operation/public companies/long term decisions/Nigerian Stock Exchange/dividend and taxation/shareholders' funds and share capital/cash inflows/Net Present Value/Accounting Rate of Return /Internal Rate of Return/capital market/internal policy/Low level of investment *||||||Awodiran, Michael Olufemi|M|DNA hybridization and cytogenetic studies of the fish species clarias anguillaris (linnaeus, 1758), heter-obpanchus longifilis (valenciennes, 1840) and other reciprocal hybrids (pisces, clariidae)||||||M.Sc.

The studies were carried out at both the chromosomal and molecular levels. Morphometric characterizations of the hybrids produced were carried out to show differences between hybrids of the two reciprocal crosses.The hybrids produced and the parental H. longifilis performed better than C. anguillaris in terms of growth and development. The hybrids from the reciprocal crosses also showed intermediate features of the parental species while no significant difference was recorded, between the two hybrids from the reciprocal crosses.The mitotic chromosomes of hatchlings of C. anguillaris and H. longifilis parental stock and the hybrids studied revealed that C. anguillaris had a chromosome complement of 2n = 54 while H. longifilis had a chromosome number of 2n = 50. The hybrids from the reciprocal crosses also had a chromosome complement of 2n=52 which was the sum of the haploid sets of the two parental species. A number of mitotic polyploid cells were found in addition to the normal diploid cells. The meiotic chromosomes of the hybrids studied also showed a haploid number of n=26.Although DNA hybridization studies on the specimens did not yield any positive result, this work indicates that intergeneric hybridization has potential for increasing growth performance. Moreover, the superior performance of H. longifilis and the hybrids in terms of growth rate may also recommend them for further genetical improvement to enhance growth and feed utilization.|Theses Collection|Intergeneric crosses/Heterobranchus longifilis/Clarias anguillaris/Clariidae/genomes/hybrids/chromosomal/molecular levels/Morphometric characterizations/mitotic chromosomes/mitotic polyploid cells/diploid cells/growth/feed utilization    *||||||Awofisayo, Oladipupo Albert|M|Slavery and slave trade in Badagry C. 1500-1900||||||M.Phil.

This has been done to ascertain the roles actually played by the town, its quarter chiefs, British and French companies in the trade during this period.The study was based on an extensive collection and analysis of oral data as well ethnographic materials. Field trips were conducted to the Slave House, Akran's palace and other historical centers in the area. Oral information was collected from different parts of Badagry through the interview technique. The interviews were conducted in English, Ogu and Yoruba languages. Archival materials and private documents were also used in the work.The study revealed that the people of Badagry fully participated in the trade during this period. Many of the quarter chiefs also became wealthy and famous as a result of the trade. The study has also been able to confirm the description of Badagry as an emporium of slaves. It has been observed that the abolition of the slave trade affected the economic fortune of the people of Badagry adversely as the legitimate trade took some years to develop. This led to migration of people out of the famous town to seek their fortunes elsewhere, a trend which resulted in the emergence of many Gun villages in the area.The study concluded that slavery and slave trade in Badagry during the period under study went beyond moral issues. But like other themes in economic history, the slave traffic between Europe and West Africa in general was a perfect operation of the economic laws of demand and supply.|Theses Collection|Slave trade/Badagry/coast of West Africa/ethnographic materials/slave house/Akran's palace/emporium of slaves/migration *||||||Awolowo, Wednesday Ajibola|M|Blood flow in viscoelastic tubes with outflow||||||M.Sc.

The total number of detected lineament was 2,059 with a total length 5,198.67 lineal kilometer. The lineament map of the study area was produced by interpretation of the aforementioned photographs and maps. The lineaments were analyzed by recording the azimuth frequency and length of each that fell within ten degree azimuthal intervals The data were used in plotting the A-F/L diagrams and lineament density map.The pattern of lineaments studied was characterized by a strong degree of' preferred orientation in the approximate trends N-S, NW-SE:, NE-SW, ENE-WSW and F-W The dominant trend with approximate orientations of N-S and E-W, was interpreted to be associated with the two phases of folding caused by Pan-African Orogeny. The ENE-WSW and NE-SW structural trends were also found prominent. The NE-SW trending lineament was interpreted as representing the trend of lfewara fault. Also the existence of' NE-SW and NW-SE trending lineaments were associated with a conjugate system of NE-SW and NW-SE trending strike - slip faults in the area. Density-wise, the lineament pattern concentration and total length recorded in the area of study were more of contribution of drainage and drainage divides. The existence of long drainage and drainage divides east of' the study area gave it distinct long lineament with a unique NE trend. This orientation was presumed to be dictated by the orientation of Efon-Psammite formation. At the western flank of the study area, highest concentration of lineaments was found. This was interpreted to be due to the presence of short lineaments in the area.The fracture map produced can thus serve as data base for mineral exploration, ground water investigation geotechnics, as well as for disaster monitoring and control.|Theses Collection|Remote sensing/geophysical data/Precambrian Basement complex/rock/topographic maps/aeromagnetic map/aerial photographs/azimuth frequency and length/Pan-African Orogeny/drainage/Efon-Psammite formation/geotechnics*||||||Awoyinka, Ayodele Folasade|F|Establishing the basis of performance in the foodservice system of small-scale enterprise||||||Ph.D. Technology Policy & Planning|F.E.

Six Local Government Areas (LGAs), Ilesha, Ife, Iwo,Ila, Olorunda and Ede in Osun State of Nigeria were studied. Specific locations within each local government were selected for the study. These were the business centres, commercial bus depots and local government secretariats. Structured interview schedules were used to collect data from one hundred and forty four foodservice owners. Five customers were also randomly selected in each foodservice establishment and interviewed. Frequency and percentage distributions, means, standard deviation, and relevant technology management theoretical frameworks were used to describe the data collected. Correlation analysis was used to test the hypothesis and regression analysis was used to test the strength of the relationship between dependent and independent variables.The results showed that sole proprietorship dominated the ownership structure of the foodservice establishments. Most of the foodservice owners had no formal training. Labour ( r = 0.316); Technology ( r = 0.250) and the Operational size of the business ( r = 0.593) were significantly correlated to performance. Multiple regression analysis showed a positive and significant relationship between labour (T = 7.434) and performance of the foodservice. Operational size, size/type of labour was the crucial factors that determined profit (performance) of the small-scale foodservice business in the study area.Technology management theory analyses provided better explanations for the characteristics of the foodservice system of the small-scale enterprises in Osun State.  The theory predicts that five learning related variables - the number of people involved in productive work ; the level of education/training of the people in the economy and those involved in production in particular; the linkages (the breadth and depth of knowledge and skills) in the economy; the learning rate/intensity of the workforce and those involved in productive activities; and experience (the learning history) of the society and those involved in production in the society; directly determine the performance of individual business organisations and the contributions of the group to the performance of the economy.

It was used to analyse the Greek text of Mark 2:1-12. It compared and contrasted the text with the Synoptic parallels, namely, Matthew 9:1-8 and Luke 5:17-26. The interview method was also used in obtaining information from people who claimed that they had been healed miraculously at one time or the other. Publications of relevant charismatic churches that relate to healing were consulted. The participation-observation method was also used to assess healing claims and their perceived theological significance.The thesis found that the incarnation of Jesus as the Son of Man has become demonstrable in his pronouncement at the healing of the Paralytic. The thesis also discovered that this pronouncement was meant to correct a wrong impression about the person and mission of Jesus on the part of the audience.The thesis concluded that miraculous healing activities could be used as a tool to proclaim Christianity in contemporary Nigeria.

The strength of the effective interacting potential V0 was obtained for different incident energy and each target nuclei. The subtraction method was used, this was done by subtracting the contribution of multistep compound (MSC) from the total differential crosssection to obtain the contribution by the multistep direct (MSD) which is always forward peaked.The calculated forward cross-section excess values were fitted to the experimental forward excess using the Chi square (÷2) minimization method.The dependency of the MSD cross-section on the incident energy was discussed. The sensitivity of the MSD cross-section on the input parameters such as spin cut-off parameter, optical potential parameter [(for proton : Becchetti & Greenless and Perey & Perey while for alpha particle : Avrigeanu , Mac Fadden & Satchler , Arthur & Young,  Nolte PR and Huizenga & Igo were used)] and the residual potential function [such as Yukawa: , Gaussian and Zero range forms of potential ]were examined .The optical potential parameters examined for calculating the distorted wave function for the proton are Becchetti & Greenless and Perey & Percy.

The result of the study also showed that the experimental group, after exposure to concrete models recalled what they have learnt better than the control group that was exposed to lecture method (At level 0.05, t = 6.44, df = 298, P < 0.05). The results also revealed that students who were taught with the concrete models developed positive attitude towards mathematics (At level 0.05, t = 9.14, df = 298, P < 0.05).The following inference can be made from the findings of the study. In the first instance, the use of concrete models can significantly improve the students' performances in mathematics. Secondly, the student's retentive ability can be increased significantly with the use of concrete models. Thirdly, there would be positive difference in the attitude of students exposed to the use of concrete models.|Theses Collection|Learners' acquisition of mathematical problem/concrete models/lecture method/Learners' Attitude Towards Mathematics Questionnaire/Mathematics Achievement Test/   *||||||Idowu, Mary Kemi|F|The response of Tomato plant (Lycopersicon esculentum) to sodium and potassium application in soil culture||||||M.Sc.

DT 95/258') (Lycopersicon esculentum) was studied in soil culture. The soil was collected from the Teaching and Research Farm, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria.The experiment was a factorial design with four levels each of Na and K. Sodium was applied as NaCl at 0, 5, 10 and 20 mgKg-' and K was applied as KC1 at 0, 20, 40 and 80 mgKg-' . Records were taken of plant height, number of leaves, and flowers shoot and root dry matter yield and nutritional symptoms caused by the deficiencies or excesses of the nutrients weekly until the termination of the experiment at five months, thereafter, chemical analyses of plant were carried out.At three months of growth, the plant receiving 0 mgKg-' Na treatment showed K deficiency symptoms while those receiving 20 mgKg-' Na were severely necrotic and apparently toxic to the plant. However, the application of K seemed to play an antagonistic role on Na uptake. Vigorous plant growth with no deficiency symptoms, increased shoot and root dry matter yield, height, numbers of leaves, flowers and fruits reflecting the synergistic relationship between K and Na were obtained at treatment combinations of 20 mgKg-' K with 10 mgKg-1Na, 40 mgKg-' K with 10 mgKg -1 Na and the best plant performance was observed at 40 mgKg -%with 5 mgKg -1 Na corresponding to K: Na ratios of 2:1, 4:1. and 8:1 respectively. The root dry matter yield was observed to be greater than shoot dry matter yield at increasing Na application thus resulting in reduced top to root ratio.Potassium concentration in plant tissue increased consistently with increasing K application while Na concentration decreased. Addition of 5 mgKg-1 Na depressed the toxic effect of K at 80 mgKg-' treatment rates. Tissue K and tissue Ca decreased at 20mgKg-1 Na while tissue Na and tissue P increased. However, at low K, Na can be a complementary element to the enhancement of growth of tomato in soil culture.|Theses Collection|Nutrient composition/growth/soil culture/necrotic/potssium/sodium/synergistic relationship/tomato/Lycopersicon esculentum*||||||Awoyemi, Olubukola Akinola|M|The effect of using different types of fertilizer on the growth rates of Oreochromis niloricus (L) and Clarias gariepinus (Burchell) in home stead fish ponds||||||M.Sc.

In addition to testing the effectiveness of different type of fertilizers on the growth of O. niloticus and C. gariepinus. The effectiveness of cheap and readily available organic fertilizers as substitutes for expensive superphosphate for the growth of the fishes in homestead ponds was also tested.Six hundred and seventy live  fingerlings of O. niloticus and three hundred and twenty live fingerlings of C. gariepinus were stocked at the rate of 5 fingerlings per meter square and stocking density of 200 fingerlings per pond area (40m') in five different dug out homestead ponds. The size of each pond was 8m x 5m x 1.2m.Four out of the live ponds were treated with four different types of fertilizers including a combination of inorganic and organic fertilizer, while the fifth pond served as control.Total lengths and weights gained by these fishes, together with some water quality parameters were taken and recorded periodically.Growth of fishes was highest in the pond treated with a combination of superphospate and poultry manure. This is closely followed by the pond treated with poultry manure only. The other two ponds gave fairly good results except for the control pond without fertilizer application where growth was minimal.One important conclusion from this study is that O. niloticus and C. gariepinus have great potential for homestead level of' production with only poultry manure application.|Theses Collection|Fertilizer/pond/Clarias gariepinus/Oreochromis niloticus/superphosphate/fingerlings/poultry manure/*||||||Balogun, Adeoye Lambe|M|Adoption of alley farming among farmers in Osun State, Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Agricultural Extension & Rural  Sociology|E.A.

Data were collected from randomly selected 130 programme and non-programme farmers. A structured interview schedule was used for data collection. Frequency counts and percentages were used to describe the data. In addition, correlation, regression and chi-square analyses were used to test the hypotheses. Factor and component analyses were also used to isolate crucial factors influencing adoption of alley farming in the study area.The results showed that there was a positive and significant correlation at P<0.05 between adoption of alley farming and number of wives of the farmers (r = 0.2454); number of children (r = 0.1720); and rights to occupy land (r = 0.1995). It also showed that only three variables of research-extension-farmer-input-linkage-system were significantly correlated to adoption of alley farming.Seven groups of factors that were significantly related to adoption of alley farming in the study areas were isolated.

The study was carried out using the questionnaire approach structured to obtain information on the various indices of personal hygiene such as washing hands before and after meals and after visiting the toilets: frequency of bathing and cutting nails: methods of waste disposal, water treatment and handling of adult and infant foods. The questionnaire was administered to a total of 200 mothers visiting the post-natal clinic of the Eleyele Comprehensive Health Centre, Ile-Ife. Their responses were validated by follow-up home visits to 20% of the mothers.Results obtained show that most respondents (74.5 %) dispose of their wastes indiscriminately around homes and other public places where they constituted potential sources of air and water pollution. and hence health hazards to man and animals. The overall prevalence of infant diarrhoea (23%) and the condition is more prevalent among children of mothers with poor practices of personal and domestic hygiene than their counterparts.Diarrhoea episodes correlated inversely with frequency of washing toilet and cutting nails, mothers educational background and socio-economic status while directly increasing with the distance of water supply source. Although people were well aware of diarrhoea as a disease. Only 22.1% believed that it is caused by environmental contamination and poor hygiene practice and 34.5% perceived the disease as dangerous. These findings suggest that a sustained programme of health education and improved water supply may be needed to increase awareness and promote personal and domestic hygiene behaviour of mothers.|Theses Collection|Hyiene/diarrhoea/infant/post-natal clinic/air and water pollution/educational background/water supply/disease/health education *||||||Dare, Akinniyi Lawrence|M|Factors affecting the preweaning growth performance of the West African Dwarf goat||||||M.Sc.

The records covered a period of four years from 1989-1992. Results showed that the litter size at birth for the flock was 1.94± 0.06kg, litter size at weaning was 1.63 ±0.05kg. The percentage kid viability for the flock was 71.70%, and the preweaning growth rate was 38.5 ± 0.42g/day.Results indicated that litter size at birth, birth weight, parity, sex, year and season of birth significantly (P<0.05) affected preweaning growth performance of the West African Dwarf (WAD) goat. Heritability estimates from sire component was 0.28±0.11 for birth weight, 0.18±0.01 for litter size at birth and 0.25±0.01 for preweaning growth rate. Repeatability estimates of 0.68 0.03, 0.18±0.05' and 0.34 ±0.02 were obtained for birth weight, litter size at birth and preweaning growth rate respectively.The phenotypic and genetic correlations between the preweaning growth rate and birth weight were 0.29 and 0.11 respectively, these were moderately significant (P<0.05). The phenotypic and genetic correlations between preweaning growth rate and litter size were -0.23 and 0.02. While the phenotypic correlation was significant, the genetic correlation of 0.02 was however, not significant (P<0.05). The annual reproductive rate was 2.52 kids per breeding doe while the productivity index of 15.4kg at weaning was obtained. Kids weight at birth appears to be the best criteria for selection to improve the preweaning growth performance. The advantage of multiple birth was very visible but selection for twining is likely to sustain and improve the viability of the kids and hence, the productivity of the herd.|Theses Collection|Preweaning/growth performance/West African Dwarf (WAD) goat/kidding and production/litter size/flock/heritability/phenotypic and genetic correlation/reproductive rate/productive index/herd *||||||Ejiogu, Stanley Chibuzor|M|The use of local substrate in spawn production for cultivation of mushrooms||||||M.Sc.

The mushroom species were isolated on conventional media (sabouraud dextrose agar and potato dextrose agar). Sterile soaked pieces of each substrate (15 g) were inoculated with 2 x 2 mm portion of the pure mycelia culture and incubated at 34-35°C until the pieces were covered with a thin film of mycelium.The efficiency of the test plant materials was compared to that of the conventional substrates (sorghum grains and tobacco midribs) for viability and pure quality spawn culture. The test local plant materials were relatively good spawn substrates when compared with the conventional substrates. The percentage weight losses of the six test plant materials as spawn substrates for Pleurotus florida incubated for 28 days ranged between 14.67 and 33.67%, while those of the conventional substrates were 22.23% and 55.47% for sorghum grains and tobacco midribs respectively. The percentage weight losses of the six test plant materials as spawn substrates for Lentinus squarrosulus incubated for 28 days were also between 32.67 and 49.00%, while those of the conventional substrates were 33.53% and 56.33%, for sorghum grains and tobacco midribs respectively. The percentage weight losses of the six test plant materials as spawn substrates for Lentinus tigrinus incubated for 28 days ranged between 38.00 and 50.67%, while those of the conventional substrates were 32.00% and 59.33% for sorghum grains and tobacco midribs respectivelyThe changes in the initial acidity (pH) values of the substrates during mycelia growth of the three mushroom species had little or no effect on spawn quality. Undifferentiated fruit bodies were observed during the eight-week cultivation of uncased substrates probably due to inadequate ventilation.From this study, it was observed that T. grandis midribs was the best substrate for spawning Lentinus species recorded, while cornstover was the best substrate for spawning P. florida. Generally, L. tigrinus was found to be the most vigorous growing of the three species on most of the six substrates. This result is encouraging, in that, it clearly revealed that at least some of our local edible mushroom species could be spawned on our local substrates.|Theses Collection|Mushroom/Mussanga cercropioides midribs/Azadirachta indica bark/Lentinus squarrosulus and Lentinus tigrinus/mycelia growth/ventilation/cornstover/local substrates *||||||Bada, Babatunde Saheed|M|Heavey metal concentration of soil and vegetation associated with highways of two different traffic densities in Osun State||||||M.Sc.

Detailed information about this is not readily available in Nigeria. The objectives of this study were therefore to determine the effect of traffic densities on gasoline associated heavy metals in soil and vegetation along selected roadsides and estimate the extent to which vehicular movement along the roads in Osun State, Nigeria, contributes to heavy metal pollution of soils and plants.Soil and vegetation samples were taken along two roads: Ife-Ibadan (with a high traffic density of 5,364vehicles/day) and Ife-Ifewara (with a low traffic density of 1.358vehicles/day). The samples were collected at different road segments (uphill, downhill, flat surface and bend) and at varying distances (1m,lOm,30m and 50m) away from road edge and at different soil depths (0-15cm and 15-30cm). The soil and vegetation samples were digested and analysed for Lead (Pb), Zinc (Zn), Cadmium (Cd), Nickel (Ni) and Vanadium (V) using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). To interpret the data descriptive statistics such as ANOVA, Duncan's Multiple Range test (DMR) and correlation analysis were employed.Results of the various analyses indicated that the levels of these elements were found to decrease with increasing soil depth and horizontal distance away from the road edge. The study also showed that there was positive correlation between the soil content of heavy metal and associated plants. The metal content of soils and associated plants in the higher traffic density was significantly higher than the low traffic density. The levels of the metals investigated in soils and plants were as follows: uphill > flat surface > bend> downhill. When the heavy metal content in plant samples at 50m from road edge was compared with FAO/WHO guideline for edible plant, it was observed that the metal contents in the plant along the two roads were higher, than the threshold level; hence the plants were considered contaminated.Therefore, land use within the right of way i.e. 50m on either side of the road for crop production, forage for livestock grazing, siting of artisan workshops and sun-drying of food items (e.g. fermented cassava tubers, pepper etc) should be avoided. Enactment of an enabling law and its enforcement should be considered as a priority programme of environmental management by the appropriate organs of government.|Theses Collection|Exhaust emission/combustion of fossil fuels/pollution/traffic density/soil depths/Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS)/Duncan's Multiple Range test/correlation/heavy metals *||||||Fagbenle, Olabosipo Ishola|M|Impact of non-financial incentive schemes on the productivity of construction operative in Southwestern Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The principal objective was to find a relationship, if any, between the productivity of construction operatives and the application of non-financial incentive schemes.The study employed the use of questionnaires and personal interviews conducted on both the management and the construction operatives that were randomly drawn from large, medium and small sized construction firms within the study area. A total of 170 questionnaires each were distributed to the management and the operatives, 103 and 118 were duly completed/returned by the management and the operatives respectively. On-site investigation and measurements were also embarked upon to study the activities of bricklayers and carpenters on forty (40) construction sites using six of the identified variables of non-financial incentive schemes found to be relevant to the construction industry. A likart statistical technique which is based on a Newman and Morganen subjective equation of motivation was used to determine the premiums placed on each of the various non-financial incentive schemes.	The results revealed that the applied non-financial incentive schemes had significant effect on the productivity of bricklayers and carpenters and that these incentive schemes accounted for between 6 percent and 26 percent of the variation percentage productive time of the tradesmen. The results also indicated that the management of the large sized construction firms attached greatest priority to the provision of adequate working tools and equipment to their operatives, followed by the provision of transport to and from working site as well as ensuring that the wages were paid regularly. For the medium sized firms, the management's utmost concern was ensuring that the wages were paid regularly to their workers, followed by supervision based on leadership by example. Leadership by example was accorded the greatest premium by the management of the small sized firms and this was followed by love and belongingness as well as recognition through praise for significant work done. The study concluded that management of the construction firms should attach utmost priority to the provision of adequate working tools and equipment to their operatives in order to stimulate their productivity.|Theses Collection|Incentive schemes/productivity/construction operative/management/Likart statistical technique/Newman and Morganen subjective equation of motivation/equipmen and working tools/supervision *||||||Fagbadebo, Omololu .M|M|The quest for a stable Nigeria federalism at the 1994-95 constitutional conference||||||M.Sc.

The primary and secondary sources of data among others included verbatim reports of the proceedings and official publications of the 1994/95 Constitutional Conference, text books, journals and official government publications. This was supplemented by private discussions with the participants.The findings (of the study) confirmed the well known parlous state of the Nigerian federal system. For instance, the Conference's recommendation of "rotational presidency" as a response to the clamour for "power shift" was an evidence of the entrenched geo-political disease in the federal system.The thrust of the quest for devolution of power was to reduce the excessive power concentrated at the centre. Essentially, this was aimed at making the centre less attractive in favour of the federating units. However, the study revealed that devolution of power could be an effective political instrument to aid federal stability in Nigeria when operated in a federal system that accords substantial autonomy to the federating units.The structure of the Nigerian federalism was found to be erected on a political platform of ethnic hostility with a pronounced fear of domination among the federating units. It was discovered that more than any others, this endemic political malaise constituted a slippery terrain where political actors- civil and military - have been juggling with the fate of the Nigerian federal system.It was further revealed that the political actors were aware of the need for an effective political platform that could guarantee federal stability. Nevertheless, they were not ready to come to terms with the reality of the Nigeria federalism. For instance, delegates at the Constitutional Conference expressed deep concern for the "mistakes" of the past on the state of the Nigerian federal set up. Similarly, the then military government actually charged the Conference to confront the problem with a view to restoring confidence. In the final analysis, there was no mutually agreed position. Debates on volatile issues were greeted with sharp ethnic divisions. And the military leaders, most often, exploited such development to influence, covertly, the outcome of the conference. Thus, the panacea offered for federal stability, at the Conference, could not go beyond rhetoric. The vacuum between the recommendations and the enabling constitutional provisions made a ridicule of the exercise. The birth and growth of the Nigerian federation were predicated on force. The colonial government midwived its operation while the post- independence military regimes enforced its growth to maturity. This instrument of force, as a balancer runs ceaselessly, like a life saving device, in the political veins of the Nigerian federalism, and this is contrary to one of the theoretical foundations for stable federalism. The departed colonial government and the subsequent military regimes could not bequeath a stable federal society because its doctrines and orientations are opposed to their own mode of operation. Hence the continuous political hiccups in the Nigerian federation.|Theses Collection|Centralization of power/stability/structural imbalance/1994/95 Constitutional Conference/federal system of governance/rotational presidency/power shift/devolution of power/ethnic hostility/military regimes/delegates/civilian government*||||||Ojo, Olugbenga David|M|Knowledge, attitudes and practices of parentss and teachers in relation to adolescents' reproductive health training in Osun State, Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Duidance & Counselling|K.A.

It also found out what the parents did (i.e. their practices) in training their children. It was also aimed at examining the influence of gender and religion on the attitudes of parents and teachers as regards adolescent reproductive health training.Attitude Towards Reproductive Health Training Inventory adapted from Bloch Doris'(1970) Attitude Towards Content and Timing of Sex Education (SECT) and Knowledge and Practices of Reproductive Health Training Questionnaire were administered to 1,400 respondents. The respondents comprised 600 teachers and 800 parents after stratifying the state schools into urban and rural schools. The sampled parents were chosen by careful and purposive selection in order to eliminate parents who are teachers while sampled teachers were obtained by random sampling method. The relevant data were analysed using t-test, chi square and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) statistics at the 0.05 level of significance.The results showed that teachers were more knowledgeable in adolescents' reproductive health training matters than parents (df=1398) P<0.05, t=22.94. It showed that urban parents were more knowledgeable in adolescent reproductive health training than the rural parents (df=798) P<0.05, t=8.68. It also revealed that parents relied on adolescents' self-discovery mode and method in training the adolescents in reproductive health matters (df=798) P>0.05, t=1.53.

In particular the study examined the admission requirements and procedures for admission of sandwich students vis a vis students in the regular programme. It also compared the course contents and the extent of coverage of both the sandwich and regular programmes. Further, the study assessed the attitude of sandwich students, college lecturers and school headmasters in Ilesa East and West Local Government Areas of Osun State to the sandwich programme.The population for this study was in four groups: 595 sandwich students, 48 college lecturers, 21 programme managers including the co-ordinators of all the study centres, and 50 school headmasters in Mesa East and West local government areas. From this population, a sample of 355 sandwich students, 20 college lecturers. 10 programme managers and 30 school headmasters was selected using stratified and proportional sampling procedures. Official documents on the admission requirements and procedures for admission into the sandwich and regular programmes were collected from the sandwich directorate and the admission office of the college. Also, the Sandwich Programme Appraisal Scale (SPAS) and Sandwich Programme Interview Schedule (SPIS) were administered on the sample. The data collected were analysed using simple percentages and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).The results showed that the admission requirements and procedures for the sandwich programme and the regular programme were not the same. For instance while the admission requirements and procedures for admission into the sandwich programme are controlled by the sandwich directorate of the college, those for the admission into the regular programme are controlled by Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Abuja The perception of the programme managers, the college lecturers and the sandwich students on the admission requirements and procedure were significantly different (F=11.8, df= 2,362, P < 0.05).

The aim was to investigate the changes in tree species population and litter production in the forest after the fire.Soil samples were randomly collected at two depths: 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm in the study plots and analysed for soil properties (pH, particle size distribution, organic matter content, cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+ and Mn2+), total nitrogen, exchangeable acidity and cation exchange capacity). All woody stems >, lm in height were completely enumerated in the plots and identified. Species richness, number of genera and families were established for the plots. Girth sizes of the trees were measured at breast height. Stem density, basal area and species diversity index were calculated for each plot. Litter production was studied monthly for one year (June 1997-May 1998).
The results from this study were compared with previous studies in the same forest.
Results showed that there was no significant difference between the plots in the soil properties studied. A total of 67 species were identified belonging to 53 genera and 23 families. Tree species richness of the burnt plot (37 per 0.25 ha) which increased to 40 species one year after the fire further increased to 67 species 14 years after. Stem density decreased significantly (p. 0.001) from 3192 trees ha -1 one year to 2456 trees ha-1 14 years after the fire. Basal area and species diversity increased during the period. The annual mortality rate for the forest was 2.02 % yr -1 while the recruitment was zero. The highest mortality rate was recorded for large trees of girth size 81-100 cm and the lowest for 21-40 cm girth size. There was higher recruitment in the smaller girth-sizes (0-20, 21-40 cm) than in the large girth-sizes. A comparison of the above parameters in the burnt and unburnt plots showed that the burnt plot has higher species diversity, stem density and litterfall but lower basal area than the unburnt plot. The unburnt plot has fewer trees in smaller girth-size but more trees in the higher girth-size classes than the burnt plot. Annual litterfall (t ha -1 yr -1) in the plot was 12.5 (total), 8.2 (leaf), 2.8 (wood 3.1cm diameter), 0.9 (reproductive) and 0.6 (trash). The highest litterfall occurred from December to March and the lowest occurred from May to August. Litterfall 14 years after the fire was significantly higher than that of 7 years after. There were changes in the relative contribution of different litterfall fractions to the total litterfall at the two periods. Percentage leaf-litter decreased from 91.7% to 69.1% while those of wood and reproductive litter fractions increased. Annual litter standing crop (t ha -1yr -1) was 112.6 t ha -1yr -1 (total), 48.0 (leaf), 46.2 (wood 3.1 diameter), 2.8 (reproductive) and 15.7 (trash). Decomposition coefficient (KL) values of litter on forest floor showed that reproductive materials are most rapidly de composed and woody material least decomposed.The findings of this study would contribute to further understanding of tropical forest dynamics during succession after fire disturbance. This may have implications for the management of rain forests which have suffered from such disturbance.|Theses Collection|Litter production dynamics/tree species population/soil properties/exchangeable acidity/cation exchange capacity/girth sizes/diversity index/stem density/basal area/rain forests/decomposition coefficient  *||||||Ojo, Oladipo Rufus|M|Application of sequence stratigraphy to reservoir delineation and description in the central oml 33, Niger Delta||||||M.Sc.

This approach has been used as a predictive tool to delineate reservoirs as well as describe their depositional setting within systems tracts. The data used include suites of geophysical well logs (Gamma Ray, Spontaneous Potential, and Resistivity), two-dimensional seismic sections, high resolution biostratigraphic and biofacies data, and the well pollen and faunal zonation data. To avoid bias in interpretation, the data sets were analyzed independently of each other and later the results were integrated. The biofacies interpretation data, microfossil zonation data and lithology interpreted from the logs were plotted against depth using a geological computer software called RAGWARE to produce a stratigraphic summary chart for each of the three wells analyzed. The stratigraphic surfaces viz: sequence boundary (SB), maximum flooding surface (MPS), and top lowstand (TLS) were identified on both the logs and biostratigraphic data. The necessary seismic criteria were employed in mapping the stratigraphic surfaces, hence, third-order sequences and systems tracts.Three sequences, which fall within two of the cyclical depositional cycles (9 and 10) that make up the sequence stratigraphic framework of Niger Delta, have been recognized in the area of study. These three sequences are composed of three marine transgressive shale markers: namely; Nonion 4 (10.4 Ma), Uvigerina 8 (9.5 Ma), and tentatively Lado shale (7.4 Ma).The sequence model shows that particular depositional systems types and facies association characterize each systems tract. The producing reservoirs within the area of study are located within the highstand systems tract (HST) and transgressive systems tract (TST) of sequence I and II respectively. The TST reservoirs of sequence II are deduced to have been deposited as sand bars within shallow marine environment. The HST reservoirs are made up of stacked sand bodies probably deposited in an inferred shallow water (proximal fluvio-marine) environment.The lowstand systems tract (LST) of sequence I is assigned high priority potential for prospect and play generation for several reasons. These include, ease of assignment of geometry and environment of deposition to its reservoir units, identification of single petroleum reservoir system and limited structural closure of the deep play. The deep play, especially within the LST, requires a focus on stratigraphic trap.The application of sequence stratigraphy in the study area allowed for prediction of additional possibilities with stratigraphic trap in the untested deeper part (LST) of the study area. The reservoirs here consist of channelized and unchannelized sand lobes. For further delineation of the play and its subsequent development, it is recommended that the extent of the channelized sand lobes and unchannelized fan lobes be mapped into the adjoining OMLs. Three-dimensional (3-D) seismic data should be acquired to properly define the limits of the play and map any subtle changes in the facies characteristics.|Theses Collection|Sequence stratigraphic/Shell's OML 33/eastern Niger Delta/systems tracts/geophysical well logs/seismic sections/high resolution biostratigraphic/biofacies data/microfossil zonation data/lithology/sequence boundary (SB)/maximum flooding surface (MPS)/and top lowstand (TLS)/lowstand systems tract/reservoirs  *||||||Ogunfowokan, Aderemi Okunola|M|Moss, surface runoff and associated sediments as indicators of metal and trace organic pollution in Lagos, Ile-Ife and Osogbo Areas||||||Ph.D Chemistry|F.O.I.

The aims of the study were to: develop a simple and efficient procedure for the GC-MS measurement and identification of PAHs in surface runoffs, sediments and mosses of Lagos, Ile-Ife and Osogbo areas, determine levels of some heavy metals and low-molecular-mass ions in the aforementioned samples; and infer that PAHs and some trace metals are indicators of traffic pollution.Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in all these samples were determined using Liquid-liquid extraction and column chromotographic technique prior to GC-MS analysis. Extraction of samples was carried out using dichloromethane, as the extractant. The sample extracts were concentrated and run through silica gel adsorbent column. The concentrate was first 'cleaned-up' by washing with n-pentane to remove all saturated hydrocarbons. Polycyclic hydrocarbons were then eluted from the column using dichloromethane: pentane mixture (85:15 V/V)Generally, in both runoff and sediment samples 13 PAHs were identified and quantified. The PAH distributions in runoff and associated sediments are dominated by three - and four-membered ring PAHs, some of which are either irritant, cancer suspect, toxic or possible mutagen. The least found PAHs were Indene and Azulene.In runoff the mean levels of PAHs ranged between 0.10 mg/L for Azulene and 15.81 mg/L for Dibenzothiophene in Osogbo and Ile-Ife areas and between 0.10mg/L for Indene and 73.72 mg/L for Dibenzothiophene in Lagos area respectively. The runoff samples from Lagos area contained between 2.03 and 110.02 mg PAH /L while those of Osogbo and Ile-Ife area contained 12.84-47.86mg PAH /L.The PAH levels in runoff of Lagos area constitute 70.03 mg/L average PAH of the total PAH detected in the study area compared to 31.96 mg/L average PAH contribution made by samples from Osogbo and Ile-Ife. The higher average PAHs reported for Lagos area compared with those of Osogbo and Ile-Ife is consistent with higher traffic density of the former study area. The levels of PAHs in sediments were relatively higher compared to those of runoffs of the study areas. The concentration of total PAHs have an upper level of 349.26 mg/kg in Lagos area while in Osogbo and Ile-Ife area the upper limit for total PAH was 272.49 mg/kg. It was established in this study that the PAHs in sediments of Lagos area contribute an average of 228.57 mg/kg to the total PAH sediment burden of the study areas compared to Osogbo and Ile-Ife area which contribute only 91.13 mg/kg average PAHs to the total PAH burden. A comparison of results obtained from this study with those reported elsewhere shows that PAH concentrations in sediments of the study area are higher than those of sediments from Norway. Elemental analysis of runoffs and sediments of the study areas showed that Mg, Ca, Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, Ni, Ba and Mn occurred in varied concentrations. The dominant ion was Mg having mean levels of 8.91 µg/mL and 8.25µg/g in runoff and sediments respectively. Some of the elements detected in samples using AAS were also detected using Capillary Electrophoresis. Results obtained by CE also show that Mg2+ was the dominant ion and that sediments are enriched in low-molecular-mass ions than their associated runoffs. Apart from Mg and Ca, all other elements viz: Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, Ni, Ba and Mn occur at higher levels in sediments compared to those in runoffs supporting the fact that soil is a sink for trace metals. In this study levels of four elements: Cd, Ni, Pb and Zn that have been allocated first priority by USEPA are below the maximum phytotoxicology upper limits of 8mg/kg, 100mg/kg, 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg for Cd, Ni, Pb and Zn respectively in surface soil. In moss samples, five general classes of organic compounds were isolated and identified. Out of a total of 40 compounds that were identified, 8 are PAHs, 2 are phthalate esters some of which are irritants, cancer suspects, toxic or possible mutagen. The efficacy of mosses as indices of traffic pollution was demonstrated in this work. Zn, Pb, and Cu were detected in moss samples of both relatively high and low traffic density sites. Results obtained show that Pb and Zn concentrations are strongly dependent on motor traffic density.|Theses Collection|Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons/Gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectometry/Atomic absorption spectrometry/capillary Electrophoresis (CE) techniques/ traffic pollution/dichloromethane/pentane mixture/mutagen/Dibenzothiophene/phytotoxicology/phthalate esters  *||||||Odeleye, Donald Abidemi|M|Psycological correlates of contemporary clothing habits of Nigerian undergraduate students||||||Ph.D. Guidance & Counselling|K.A.

Two major hypotheses were proposed to explain the possible relations between these variables. These hypotheses were broken into subsidiary postulates that related the independent variables with the four dimensions of clothing habits (social approval, anxiety, exhibitionism and originality).Descriptive survey method was used for the study. A quota sample of 1,000 undergraduate students was drawn from four universities, namely Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile- Ife, University, Ago- lwoye. The instrument comprised of four scales which were personally administered by the researcher. Three scales were used to elicit responses from the subjects on. demographic variables such as gender, age and socio-economic status, extroversion, personality stability, locus of control and religiosity. The fourth scale was used to determine clothing habits of individual subjects. The data collected was analysed by means of several sub-programmes of SPSS PC + 4.01 ANC SAS.The result of the study shows that social approval has greater influence than any other variables on the clothing habits of Nigeria undergraduates. The results reveal that major variance in clothing habits is contributed by religiosity, locus of control, personality stability and socio-economic status. They show that highly religions students are not anxious about clothing habits just like the poor students; they spend little time in making choice of what to wear unlike the rich students who show off. The results also reveal that the introvert students are original and individualistic in clothing habits more than the extrovert students. However, a distinct feature of the findings is that the older undergraduates are likely to be more original and independent in clothing habits more than the y ones. Also, female students re inclined to be more exhibitionistic than the male students.|Theses Collection|Clothing/clothing habits/Nigerian undergraduate students/personality stability/socio-economic status/religion/social approval/anxiety/exhibitionism/originality *||||||Kolade, Oladele Bolade|M|A comparative study of factors of deforestation in three ecological zones in Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The objectives of the study were to evaluate the perception of the people about the problem of deforestation in each zone; to see the peculiarity of factor (s) to each zone; examine the effectiveness of current measures/strategies for checking deforestation in each zone and therefore suggest ways of improving the effectiveness of measures and propose new control measures.Fifteen probable factors that could be responsible for deforestation were identified for field study. These factors are indiscriminate tree felling, uncontrolled fires/bush burning, timber/fuelwood extraction, poverty, lack of available alternate fuel (such as Kerosene), drought/decreased rainfall, overstocking /overgrazing, agricultural land clearing, price/credit distortions, urban expansion, increasing population/population influx, industrial land clearing, weak institutional linkage/jurisdictional overlap, construction land clearing, weak tenure and forest policies/legislation.The study relied on primary data collected through questionnaire administration and secondary data from the literature. The questionnaires were administered in three states namely Borno, Kogi and Ondo states representing Sahel savanna, guinea savanna and rainforest ecological zones respectively. Two local government areas were selected in each state/ecological zone and in each local government area, one toy r, (usually the local government headquarters) and two villages were selected for questionnaire administration. In all, six hundred (600) questionnaires were administered consisting of two hundred (200) questionnaires per ecological zone and one hundred (100) questionnaires per local government area. Administered questionnaires were subjected to statistical analysis, using descriptive and inferential statistical techniques such as frequency counts, percentages and one way analysis of variance (ANOVA -1).The results show that the level of perception of respondents to deforestation is very high, but despite this, deforestation is still going on at a very high rate in all the ecological zones. Factors responsible for and the manifestation of deforestation across the zones were discovered to be similar with slight differences. Factors such as timber/fuel wood extraction, poverty, lack of available alternate fuel (Kerosene shortage), drought/decreased rainfall, overstocking/ overgrazing, agricultural land clearing, price/credit distortion, weak institutional linkage/jurisdictional legislation show significant difference at 0.01 level across the zones. According to the weighted mean, factors with significant difference across zones have low and very low contributions to deforestation in the rainforest aid guinea savanna zones respectively while the contribution to deforestation is high in the Sahel savanna. It was also discovered that budget for afforestation is highest in the sahel savanna with lowest revenue from forestry sector.Current measures/strategies at solving deforestation such as afforestation programme are not effective and lack the involvement/participation of private organizations, community based organizations and non-governmental organizations.The study therefore suggests poverty alleviation measures, which include accelerating growth/development and establishment of effective credit scheme for small and medium scale businesses, legislative, regulatory and institutional reforms as well as a participatory approach to all forestry project planning, formulation and implementation among strategies for checking the problem of deforestation.|Theses Collection|Deforestation/ecological zones/sahel savanna/guinea savanna/rain forest/aforestation/timber/fuelwood extraction/fires/bush burning/overstocking/ overgrazing/institutional linkage/jurisdictional legislation/increasing population/population influx/urban expansion *||||||Ikamaise, Valentine Cornelius|M|Occupational exposure to heavy metals among battery charging, vehicle spraying and welding workers in Ile-Ife||||||M.Sc.

About 10% of the total number of each of the three small-scale industries in Ile-Ife were selected for the investigation. A control site was chosen at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex premises where non of the industrial activities being investigated take place.Samples of Particulate matter and soil were collected within 10-m radius of each workshop and analyzed at the laboratory for Lead, Cadmium and Mercury using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) after appropriate pre-assay preparations. Blood samples were also collected from persons employed by each selected workshop and a control population and analyzed for the heavy metals using AAS. Appropriate statistical methods were employed to determine the elemental relationship between environmental and blood levels on the one hand, and between the workshops and the control sites on the other.Results obtained show that the mean total suspended particulate (TSP) concentration in the workshops ranged from 593 ìg/m3 in VSP to 931µg/m3 in BCR, while the mean elemental concentration in air ranged from 3.8 ìg/m3 in WPB to 17.8 ìg/m3 in BCR and VSP for Pb; 23.0 ìg/m3 in WPB to 67.5 ìg/m3 in VSP for Hg; and 0.1 ìg/m3 in VSP to 1.1 ìg/m3 in WPB for Cd. Their corresponding values in the soil were 168.5 ìg/g in VSP to 13645.1 ìg/g in BCR for Pb; 6738.7 ìg/g in WPB to 16904.6 ìg/g in VSP for Hg and 88.9 ìg/g in VSP to 179.3 in WPB for Cd, and in blood from 6.9 ìg/dl in VSP to 31.8 ìg/dl in WPB for Ph; 1912 ìg/dl in VSP to 722.0 ìg/dl in BCR for Hg and 1.0 ìg/dl in VSP to 3.7 ìg/dl in WPB for Cd .The concentrations of the three heavy metals in air, soil and blood were generally lower in the control site (CTR) than within each workshop. Unlike the blood metal levels, the concentration of each metal followed a seasonal pattern with higher values in the dry season. Correlation analysis showed positive and significant relationship between air and blood, and between air and soil lead levels. The mean concentration of each heavy metal in each type of workshop exceeded the guidelines limit set by both World Health Organization (WHO) and the Nigerian Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) and suggest that the activities of these workshops constitutes occupational risk to the health of persons working in them.Appropriate risk management measures are recommended to improve the environmental sustainability of these industrial activities.|Theses Collection|Effect of Battery Charging/Vehicle Spraying/welding/mercury/cadium/atomic absorption spectrophotometer/World Health Organization (WHO)/Nigerian Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA)/occupational risk  *||||||Ijila, Pauline Oluwatoyin|F|Wind energy potential in Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

An  in-depth analysis of the Yoruba anaphoric items, such as ara-mi and ara-re, was carried out, and their referential capabilities were deeply studied.The research methodology adopted was based on the Government and Binding Theory as propounded byChomsky (1981) through rules, principles, and constraints. These were used to explain the syntactic functions and structural distribution of the anaphoric items. The study revealed the particular usage domains of Yoruba anaphora: while the ara- forms were mostly used for reference within the confines of the simple sentence, the pronominal types were used to refer to antecedents in complex and compound sentences. Any violation of these led to ungrammaticality. It also showed that the Yoruba honourific feature, which is not common to most Languages, is a. significant feature for the proper understanding of the Yoruba anaphora system.The study concluded that the Government and Binding Theory was capable of handling the Yoruba anaphoric reference (syntactically). The little shortcomings discovered were the ones generally found in the realm of Language use which were, of course, not accounted for by structural theories like ours.

Specifically, the study identified the personal and socio-economic, physical and mental development and the environmental factors influencing their educational needs.The study was conducted in the three agricultural zones of Osun State. One hundred and twenty seven out-of-school rural young farmers were selected and interviewed using the interview schedule. Descriptive statistical techniques like frequency counts, percentages and weighted mean scores were used to analyse the data. In addition, correlation and regression analyses were used to determine the relationships between the identified factors and the non-formal educational needs of the rural young farmers.The mean age of the out-of-school rural young farmers was 22.09, with 3.29 standard deviation. Majority of them were female (52%), married (65.35%) lived with parents (75%). had no contact with extension agent (88%). and were dependent on parent for farm land (77.95%). All the respondents have dropped out of school due to financial problems, lack of interest in formal education and family problems. Areas of non-formal educational needs identified were mainly improved farm management practices in both crop and livestock production, including compost preparation and application, foliar application of fertilizer, selection and application of chemicals for weeding, pest control and storage for crop production. Other areas of non-formal educational needs in livestock production include diagnosis and selection of drugs for sick animals, cross-breeding of animals, construction of pens for goats, rabbit pens, bee hives and poultry houses. The study revealed that majority (95.28%) of the respondents did not belong to any Young Farmer group, while 11.8% were executives of local clubs. The systems of values and attitudes of the people in the communities were conducive to educational growth and development (51.97%). Four factors such as years of formal education (r=0.235), size of livestock (r=0.37), source of information on improved farm practices (r=0.288) and cosmopoliteness (r=0.290) had positive and significant correlation coefficient with non-formal educational needs of the rural young farmers. Three factors: number of children (r =-0.284), years of farming experience (r =0.252) and number of subjects required for training (r = -0.206) had negative but significant correlation with non-formal educational needs of out-of-school rural young farmers. It is therefore concluded that the three factors influencing the training needs of the Young Farmers in the negative direction are the most important factors of training programmes e.g. years of farming experience, number of subject required for training and number of children.|Theses Collection|Non-formal educational needs/rural young farmers/environmental factors/extension agent/farm land/family problems/finances/farm management practices/crop and livestock production/educational growth and development/cosmopoliteness*||||||Moses, Roselyn Funke|F|Effect of power supply on the productivity of selected enterprises in south western Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

This study was designed to examine these policies as they affect the production performances of such enterprises.The data for the study were collected from a sample of eleven randomly selected small, medium and large firms that engage in metal and agro-allied products, in Lagos and Oyo States by using questionnaire, personal observation and guided interview. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and engineering economy methods.The result revealed that 72.7% of firms relied both on NEPA and generating sets, while 18.2% relied on NEPA. One of them used only generating set as source of electric power supply. A significant proportion (72.7%) of the firms using generating set, and NEPA claim this decision to be due to the unreliability of NEPA services. As a result of the unreliability of electric power supply in most of the manufacturing enterprises, the production process is affected. From the study, the effect of frequent outages on the total output of the enterprises was identified to include: reduction in quality and quantity of total production output, increase in cost of production due to high cost of energy supply, increase in cost per unit output of firm, and decrease in the firm's total revenue. Plots of energy intensity index and production index over the study period (1993-1997) show that as energy intensity index increased, production index declined. This is an indication of inefficient domestic energy utilization in most of the firms. However, an increase in production index and decline in energy intensity index was observed in two of the companies. These companies are large enterprises which utilize both NEPA and generating set as source of electric power supply.It is obvious from the results in this study that the unreliability of power supply through the national grid has serious effect on the production performance of firms in the metal and agro-allied products sector, and that a combination of measures to revitalize NEPA facilities and deregulation of power supply to allow for joint independent power providers (IPPs) as well as embarking on research into renewable energy sources would be needed to turn around the power supply situation in the country.|Theses Collection|Electric power supply/national grid/energy policy/generating set/metal and agro-allied products/Natioanal Electric Power Authourity (NEPA)/outages/energy intensity index/production index/Independent Power Providers (IPPs)    *||||||Muoghalu, Caroline Okumdi|F|A study of the life styles of professional women in Ile-Ife and Lagos, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The aim of the study is to build profiles of the life styles of professional women in Ile-Ife and Lagos.The fieldwork was undertaken between September and November 1998 in Ile-Ife and Lagos. The research instruments comprised in depth interview schedule and questionnaires. Quantitative and qualitative methodologies were used. Using purposive sampling techniques, 200 respondents were selected, out of which 133 completed the questionnaires and 10 were interviewed in depth to provide qualitative data on the ways of life of professional women. The respondents were selected from ten different professions - Medicine, Law, Teaching - tertiary and lower levels, Police, Banking, Accounting, Nursing, Pharmacy and Administration. The data were analysed using non-parametric statistics.The results indicate that most professional women are still within the child bearing age. Their age at first marriage increases with education and therefore, they tend to marry later than their illiterate sisters. Most of them had their first pregnancies between the ages of 26 and 35 years. They do not have more than four children and delivered their babies in hospitals. They use pills and other forms of orthodox family planning methods. They are generally highly educated with at least a first degree, and are mainly in teaching and nursing, the usual traditional women's professions. Most professional women spend between 5 to 9 hours and very few spend between 10 to 13 hours in the work place daily, and an average of 11.8 hours at home daily. They spend their free time doing housework in their homes. Their husbands take major decisions. Most of them are involved in religious programmes and charitable activities despite their tight schedule. Very few are involved in development programmes. They appeared not to have suffered discrimination with respect to promotion, salary and training in their workplaces. They are promoted and sent to training as often as men and earn as much as their male counterparts, the only difference is that they are denied children tax allowance offered to men. Their life styles are the same irrespective of the fact that they are in different professions. There is no significant difference between the life styles of professional women in Ile-Ife and Lagos. Professional women still carry out traditional household chores and combine productive and reproductive roles in varying degrees. Consequently the professional women studied do not have much time for leisure. The women cherish family happiness more than professional accomplishment. However, most of them want to get to the peak of their professions.It is concluded that it is not that professional women are not ambitious but that there are so many factors beyond their control militating against their progress.|Theses Collection|Career paths/associational patterns/division of labour/reproductive health/illiterate/pregnancies/family planning methods/salary and training/promotion/tax allowance/ambition *||||||Layeni, Olawale Patrick|M|Variational formulation of contact problems||||||M.Sc.

It then attempts to establish conditions for existence and uniqueness of the problems. The thesis highlights the variational approach to problems of solid mechanics and recalls some concepts associated with finite elasticity and elements of functional analysis with respect to space specifications. It considers the variational formulations of unilateral contact problems, which invariably lead to variational inequalities.With respect to small deformations, it gives the variational formulation for the case of a short memory viscoelastic material in unilateral contact with a rigid elastic foundation. The pertinent conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the solution to this problem are then obtained. Furthermore, in the case of finite deformation, the variational formulation for a viscoelastic material in unilateral contact with a rigid foundation that permits large elastic deformation is given by invoking the concepts of hyperelasticity and polyconvexity for energy functions. The conditions for the existence of solution to this problem are also obtained.|Theses Collection|Viscoelastic materials/finite deformation/variation/solid mechanics/elasticity/variational inequalities/small deformation/hyperelasticity/polyconvexity for energy functions*||||||Kulepa, Akeem Adewale|M|Effects of market and foreign exchange liberalization on the production and marketing of cocoa in southwestern Nigeria (1970 -1996)||||||M.Sc.

The primary data were obtained from three hundred respondents, half of whom were farmers and the remaining produce marketers. Six cocoa producing Local Government Areas were randomly selected in Ondo, Osun and Oyo States. The secondary data, which were mainly time series data on aggregate cocoa output, exchange rates, interest rates, producer prices, aggregate fertilizer supply and world prices were obtained from Federal Office of Statistics, Central Bank of Nigeria, State Ministries of Agriculture and Natural Resources and International Cocoa Organisation manuals. The analytical techniques employed were descriptive statistics (range, mean, mode, median, percentages) and ANOVA, correlation and regression analysis and market concentration indices of Bains, Gini Coefficients and Lorenz curve.Results of the various analyses indicated that the factors influencing cocoa output at farm level included, old age of the farmers, small size of holdings, man-days of labour employed, illiteracy, old age of cacao trees, as well as scarcity of young and energetic people in the cocoa production industry. The study also showed that about seventy percent of the produce marketers entered the industry during the inception of Structural Adjustment Programme. The various concentration indicators show that there was little barrier to entry into the cocoa marketing industry and no firm could influence market price. Lastly, the result of the estimated cocoa production response function indicated that aggregate cocoa output is determined by the lagged real producer prices, lagged exchange rates, lagged world prices, interest rates and aggregate fertilizer supply.|Theses Collection|Cocoa/cocoa output/real producer prices/exchange rates/interest rates/world prices and fertilizer supply/State Ministries of Agriculture and Natural Resources/ International Cocoa Organisation manuals/small size of holdings/illiteracy/labour/new species/ Structural Adjustment Programme*||||||Opaleye, Olalekan Abdul-rauf|M|Analysis and policy implications of energy demand in the Nigerian petroleum refining industry||||||M.Sc.

The first refinery was constructed and commissioned in 1965. The industry has grown steadily over the years and is now made up of four local refineries with a combined installed capacity to process 445,000 barrels of crude oil per standard day. The industry itself is a heavy consumer of energy. Thus, this study was designed to analyze the industry's total energy demand and assess the overall energy efficient utilization planning in the Port-Harcourt refinery.The study employed a secondary data collection as well as the use of questionnaire and interview techniques to collect data from the Port-Harcourt refinery. The refinery's annual energy demand for the various energy types from 1989 to 1996 was determined. The basic analytical approach adopted for the study involves the calculation of energy intensities. The data analysis for the study is limited to the Port-Harcourt Refinery due to the closure of Kaduna and Warri Refineries as at the time of data collection.The Port-Harcourt refinery is a good example of a modern refinery with a factory designed energy intensity of 4.00 barrels of crude oil equivalent (BOE) to process 100 barrels of crude oil (0.04 BOE/BOE) to various petroleum products. However, the results of the study showed that the actual energy demand for each year under study (1989 1 996) exceeded the required refinery standard in varying degrees (4.28 BOE/BOE to 8. 09 BOE/BOE). This implies that the performance of the refinery for the eight-year period, in terms of energy demand efficiency was very poor. As a result of this inefficient energy utilization, an average daily wastage of about 2,707 barrels of crude oil, estimated to be $50,000 (US Dollars) was incurred, based on the 1989 posted price of $18.61 per barrel of crude oil. The study shows that lack of optimal fuel utilization mix could be attributed for the reason for the poor energy demand efficiency in the refinery's energy demand pattern. Over the study period, the highest level of energy demand efficiency of 0.0428 BOE/BOE, which was close to the standard, was achieved in the year 1995. This was due to the utilization of a proper energy mix of fuel gas, petroleum coke and AGO for that year. The use of this energy mix or a better combination should be encouraged in the refinery.|Theses Collection|Nigerian Petroleum Refining Industry/petroleum products/crude oil/energy intensity/optimal fuel utilization mix/petroleum coke/fuel gas *||||||Oluyemi, Olubiyi Nicholas|M|Effects of hardness of water on crude oil biodegradation by autochtonous bacterial flora ||||||M.Sc.

The possibility of employing microorganisms, to clear spilt oil has been the subject of review and research in the laboratories. The present study was undertaken to determine the effect of water hardness on biodegradation of crude oil in aquatic environment using autochtonous bacteria. The effect was studied in relation to the physical and chemical properties of water that could influence the microbial degradation of oil.Five different water samples were used for this work; marine water from Lagos; stream water, well water, tap water and rain water all from Ile-Ife. Their physical and chemical properties were analyzed using standard methods. The properties measured were pH(6.53-7.85),Turbidity(38-300), conductivity(12.0-46,400), Dissolved oxygen(6.40-10.30mgL-I), Nitrate(0.028-0.252mgL-1), Nitrite(nil), Sulphate(0.00-784.00mgL-1), phosphate(0.020-0245mgL-I), calcium(0.74-742.60mgL-I) , magnesium (0.312-292.00mgL-1), total hardness (3.13-3,056.16mgL-1), total alkalinity(4.00-350.00mgL-1), bicarbonate(4.88-426.62mg-1)and chloride(0.154-20,500.00mgL-1).The presence of autochtonous bacteria was first ascertained in all the water samples by preliminary test while fungal growth was prevented by antifungal drug. Bacterial counts were equally accounted for, twelve genera were the total oil degrading bacterial counts obtained.Biodegradation of Nigerian Escravos Gulf crude oil was carried out under normal conditions in all the water samples and under induced hardness in rain water sample alone. Biodegradation under normal conditions was observed to follow the order of rain > marine > stream > well > tap. Water hardness was observed to enhance biodegradation when Mg2+ + Ca2+ or Mg2+ alone were induced and the two conditions appeared not to be effective herders, but induce- Ca2+alone appeared to hinder biodegradation and can be used as herder.The GLC analyses of residual oil recovered from both normal conditions, induced hardness, control, and uninoculated weathered oil showed that hydrocarbon less than C9 disappeared not due to microbial degradation but probably due to solubilization or volatilization, hydrocarbons between C9 and C13 were completely biodegraded but higher hydrocarbons generally resisted degradation except in rain water sample. The order of effective Biodegradation was rain > marine > stream > well > tap. Biodegradation was observed better in rain water with induced hardness than normal rain water in the order of Mg2+ + Ca2+ > Mg2+ > normal rain >Ca2+.Biodegradation by individual bacterial isolate was observed to be better than collective biodegradation. The ability of the isolates to degrade based on the percentage degradation followed the order of Pseudomonas oleovorans > Achromobacter ciquaillarliills  > Vibrio phytoplanktis >Enterobacter sp  >Eschericia freundii > Pseudomonas  membranoformis  > Micrococus denitrificans  > Proteus .sp Aeromonas sp > Pseudomonas fluorescens  >  Alcaligenes viscolactis  >  Flavobacterium Fucatum   > Brevibacterium linens  > Achromobacter stenohalis  > Arthrobacter ureafaciens  > Micrococcus varians.|Theses Collection|Petroleum/water hardness/biodegradation of crude oil/autochtonous bacteria/aquatic environment/turbidity/total alkalinity/bicarbonate/Escravos/solubilization/volatilization/hydrocarbons/*||||||Owolabi, Amos Akintola|M|An evaluation of manager's and accounting professionals' perception of environmental issues and reporting in south western Nigeria||||||M.Phill.

This is because a conducive environment is sin-qua-non to socio-economic and political development everywhere. This world-wide concern for environmental issues translates into an important externality for corporate entities. Therefore, the role of managers of industry and commerce as well as professional accountants in the management of the environment cannot be ignored. The skill and experience with which they manage the financial, human and material resources to attain economic objectives are invaluable to the management of the environment given the right philosophical approach and belief previous approaches to the management of the environment have been rather legalistic and coercive. This study adopts a conceptual approach to environmental issues and management.It is against this background that this study evaluates managers' and accounting professionals' perception of environmental issues and reporting in South Western Nigeria. Specifically, the study assesses the attitude of firm managers in the study area to environmental issues. It measures the perception of professional accountants to environmental information reporting and disclosure in addition to the imperative of environmental regulations and the formulation of accounting standard. We also investigate the firm's actual environmental performance in terms of the environmental costs incurred and liabilities resulting essentially from violation of environmental regulations. The study is expected to improve on our knowledge regarding the management of our environment and the necessary strategies to adopt to achieve this, in addition to serving as a framework towards accounting standards on environmental reporting.Opinions of the managers and  accountants on environmental issues are measured using the Likert scale method. Data extracted from the questionnaires for the validation of the research hypotheses are subjected to studentst  test statistic. Content review of financial reports of some listed companies is also carried out to determine the extent of environmental costs incurred and the degree of environmental information disclosure. The results of the study reveal that there is a growing awareness among managers with regard to the need for environmental performance by firms in South Western Nigeria. The managers are of the view that efforts towards the management of the environment should be disclosed in the financial reports. The accountants also strongly believe in environmental information reporting, disclosures and the setting of an accounting standard to regulate the attitude of business firms towards the environment. Paradoxically, content review of financial reports reveals the existence of a gap between managers' and accountants' perceptions of environmental information disclosure and the actual disclosure. The existence of a gap between perception and reality is apparently as a result of the voluntary nature of disclosure. To meet the aspirations of stakeholders on environmental information disclosure, it is worthwhile as a policy option to consider mandatory disclosure by way of accounting standard. The modality and guidelines for disclosure could be initiated by the appropriate constituted authority. The business operators and the auditors should be guided professionally in the preparation and audit of environmental information.|Theses Collection|Environmental degradation/human and material resources/environmental regulations/Likert scale method/financial reports/environmental information disclosure/manager's and accounting professionals*||||||Omotoso, Johnson Adeolu|M|The potency and limitations of Nigeria's foreign policy under Babangidas administration, 1985 -1993||||||M.Sc.

A total of 42 subjects with the diagnosis of LBP of lumbosacral origin resulting from mechanical derangement of the spine participated in this study. The subjects were alternately assigned to two groups Vertical Oscillatory Pressure (VOPG) and Transverse Oscillatory (TOPG). Each group consists of 21 patients. In each of these groups, (i) Spinal Range of Motion (SROM), (ii) Straight Leg Raising (SLR), (iii) level of Pain Score (PS) were taken and were compared.Patients were then treated with either VOP or TOP following standard procedure described by Nwuga (1990) thrice weekly. At the end of the treatment sessions the patients were re-assessed.

The aim was to determine the effect of the cement dust deposition on the primary productivity of the plant community in the area.Sample plots, 20mx20m, were established at 1km interval from the factory site up to 10km distance in the four cardinal directions of North, South, East and West. Within each plot five random 20m line transects were laid at 4 metre-interval. Five stands of Manihot esculenta and Saccharum officinarum were randomly selected within each plot for chlorophyll content analysis, leaf abundance and leaf area measurement. Woody species were enumerated within each plot and their girth sizes measured at breast height. Herbaceous species were also enumerated within the established plots. Topsoil samples were randomly collected at three points within each plot and analysed for pH, organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and moisture contents. Data generated were subjected to statistical analysis using One Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) while the ecological groupings of the species were determined using ordination technique with the aid of Principal Component Analysis (PCA).Chlorophyll contents, leaf abundance and leaf area of M. esculenta and S. officinarum were observed to increase significantly with increasing distance from the factory site. Woody species density and their basal areas increased significantly with increasing distance from factory site. Ordination by PCA showed that the vegetation around Ewekoro is an ecotonal community. Topsoil analysis showed that pH, organic matter, total nitrogen and moisture contents were not significantly different across the study site.

Aqueous infusion of fistula leaves contracted the colon at a dose range of 2.0 to 4.0 mg/ml, but relaxed it at a dose range of 8.0 to 16.0 mg/ml, while that of the fruit produced a very little contraction Methanolic extract of C. acutifolia leaves, reference drug, produced very little relaxation of the colon Its aqueous infusion contracted it and its effect was blocked by promethazine and nifedipine. Methanolic extract of C acutifolia fruits reference drug, contracted the colon and its action was abolished by nifedipine only Its aqueous infusion relaxed this segment Hexamethonium, promethazine and chlorpheniramine enhanced the contractile effect of aqueous infusion of C  podocarpa fruit and methanolic extract of C. fistula leaves on the colon At the colon., aqueous infusion of C. podocarpa leaves was more potent. that of C fistula leaves was equipotent. while methanolic extract of C. fistula fruits and leaves were less potent than the standard reference. The results of this investigation confirmed that the site of the laxative action of the two plants is the colon; Methanolic extract of C. fistula leaves and fruits stimulate muscarinic receptors and open calcium channels in the colon; Aqueous infusion of C. podocarpa fruit and leaves act mainly by opening the calcium channels. Methanolic extract of C acutifolia fruit caused calcium channel activation; Aqueous infusion of C. acutifolia leaves caused He receptors stimulation and calcium channel opening, It is likely that the anthraquinone glycosides in the two plants. and even the reference drugs do not possess the same chemical configuration or structure; Hexamethonium promethazine and chlorpheniramine probably caused allosteric activation of the muscarinic receptors stimulated by aqueous infusion of C. podocarpa fruit and methanolic extract of C. fistula leaves: With proper processing, the two plants can substitute for C. acutifolia, the official laxative drug.|Theses Collection|Nigeria Cassia species/Ileum and Colon of Albino wistar rats/aqueous infusion/methanolic extracts/Tolazoline/nifedipine/acutifolia leaves/laxative/Hexamethonium promethazine/chlorpheniramine/anthraquinone glycosides/allosteric activation/muscarinic receptors/fistula leaves  *||||||Goji, Sunday Dombo|M|Assessment of traditional birth attendants'(TBA) practices in the federal capital territory, Abuja, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The objective of the study was to assess the current knowledge and practices of TBAs on pregnancy, antenatal, delivery services and postnatal care for within the past one and twenty-six years.The study observed that majority of practicing TBAs were middle age married, illiterate women who had children and had been in operation for within the past one and twenty-six years. The mode of training of TBA was through apprenticeship with other TBAs usually their mothers or aunties. Although 70 (49.6%) of the TBAs studied had two weeks structured TBAs Training only 28 (19.5%) had an opportunity allow a period of 3 day for retraining.It was observed that there was no significant difference in the activities of the trained and untrained TBAs during antenatal care and preparation of women during labour and delivery. However it observed that the trained TBAs were more efficient in referral of cases, record keeping and post-natal activities such as cord care, health education, advice on immunization and breast-feeding. Some of the untrained TBAs were still engaged in some harmful traditional practices like insertion of herbs into vagina, administration of herbs orally and in dressing of the cord.Clients were still patronizing TBAs for reasons that services were cheap and it conforms with their culture. An outstanding feature of client's evaluation is that TBAs were reported to be experienced, caring, humane and therefore well accepted and trusted sources of maternal health services in the communities within the territory. TBAs, if adequately trained, equipped, supported and supervised effectively, can contribute to safe motherhood in Nigeria until adequately trained health personnel are available and readily accessible.|Theses Collection|Traditional Birth Attendants/Federal Capital Territory/pregnancy/labour/post-natal/anti-natal/illiteracy/harmful traditional practices/cluture/experience/safe motherhood/health personnel*||||||Oyelese, Olubukola Babatunde|M|Relationship between the right quadriceps angle [ Q-ANGLE] and right foot angle of selected normal population of male and female undergradrates of Obafemi Awolowo University||||||M.Sc.

The relationship between the dependent variables, right Q-angle and right foot-angle and independent variables, physical characteristics, such as Body Mass Index (BMI),Weight, height and foot lengths of the male and female subjects were also determined. The procedure involved the measurement of right Q-angle of volunteered students (50 males and 50 females) in the erect posture by use of a goniometer. The foot angle was determined for the same number of subjects through right foot prints on a walk way. The data obtained were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics.The study showed that right Q-angle had an inverse correlation with right foot angle and the correlation was not significant (r = -0.041; p>0.05). The mean right Q-angle (15.81± 4.27 degrees) was found to be significantly higher than the mean right foot angle. 8 47 ± 4.92 degrees (P<0.05) for all subjects. There was insignificant difference between the male foot angle (9.06 ± 5.16 degrees) and female foot angle. 7.88± 4.71 degrees (P>0.05). Physical characteristics such as weight, height, BMI, highest foot length and lowest foot length did not appreciably affect the values of foot angle and Q.-angle for both sexes.In conclusion, the value of Q-angle cannot be used to predict that of foot angle for an individual. Besides, these two angles cannot also be predicted from the physical characteristics such as weight, Height, BMI, highest footlength and lowest footlength. Thus separate examinations are needed to determine the values of Q-angles and foot angles.|Theses Collection|Right Q-angle/right foot angle/Body Mass Index (BMI)/goniometer/physical characteristics/weight/height/footlength                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *||||||Washington, Theresa.

Correspondingly, Aje's influence in the Africana ethos is also apparent in contemporary Africana literature. This study employed the precepts and paramount figures of Aje in the analysis of Africana literature. The project endeavoured to fully understand and correctly interpret the concept of Aje; to examine the acts and figures of Aje in the traditional and modern (published and oral) literature of Yorubaland and other Africana societies; and to construct a tool of literary analysis capable of interpreting the actuality and impact of Aje in contemporary Africana literature written in English.Methodological investigations relied on extensive collection and analysis of oral literature, contemporary literature, and literary academic studies relative to Special attention was paid to oral literature of Aje, as this literature formed the foundation of the tool of analysis. From the analysis and synthesis of the aforementioned data, a two-tiered analytical tool, The Matrix of Aje and Literary Gelede, was constructed. Using The Matrix of Ade and Literary Gelede, this study undertook thematic comparative analysis of Aje manifestations in the contemporary literature of both continental African writers and those historically dislocated as a result of the Transatlantic Slave Trade.Aje's timeless significance in Africana cultural properties and artistic expression translates into the force's capacity to evolve to fit new parameters of literary expression. Aje revealed itself to be used variously by a plethora of figures: historical, mythical, and literary entities, and, at times, the authors themselves. Importantly, the figures and forms of Aje elucidated in traditional literature emerge as archetypes for characters and occurrences in contemporary literature. This study effectively elucidated and interpreted Aje's literary import in many areas: Aje's solidification of sacred space, prophetic healers of Aje and their utilisation of power of the word, neo-political Ajes influence on gender relations, and the mother-daughter Aje relationship. Aje revealed itself to be as pertinent and complex a factor in the workings of contemporary literature as in traditional literature. In addition to their spiritual roles, Ade and Gelede festival affect specific communal and social orders. The same proclivity to restructure society and affect social balance, while evolving artistically, is clearly apparent in Aje-influenced Africana literary works. The Matrix of Aje and Literary Gelede proved appropriate and efficient tools for interpreting literary manifestations of Aje. Currently, Aje is feared, shunned, and devalued; it is rarely mentioned socially or in conjunction with aesthetic or spiritual forms. However, Aje is a force that is essential to important aspects of the Africana ethos and properties of evolution. Aje's cultural import is abundantly evident in contemporary Africana literature. Many modern authors are influenced by Aje and use the force to motivate their inter- and extra-textual communities; therefore, it is necessary that Aje take a prominent position in the realm of Africana literary theory.|Theses Collection|Aje/Africana women's spiritual power of myriad potentialities/artistic antecedents/Yoruba and Africana cultural and spiritual/The Matrix of Aje and Literary Gelede/Transatlantic Slave Trade/inter- and extra-textual communities/Africana literary theory*||||||Ogudu, Regina .E|F|Behavioural pattern of post- mastectomy patients attending radiotherapy clinic at University College Hospital, Ibadan||||||M.Sc.

Ibadan and factors influencing some selected behaviours were also identified. Sixty-five post-mastectomy patients who gave their informed consent to participate in the study were purposively selected. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire which had been tested for face validity and reliability. Data generated from the study were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical procedures.A negative pattern of behaviour was observed where behaviour involved in public religious, social and outdoor activities as well as sexual behaviour was concerned. However, family relationships and cosmetic behaviours improved.Majority (76.9%) of the women experienced emotional trauma which resulted in them making positive efforts to improve their cosmetic outlook. Some of the cosmetic enhancing behaviours included the use of special accessories and protective dressing. This behaviour pattern was observed more among married than single women and those who went out to work. Family relationships were improved as most of them enjoyed a sustained or improved relationship with their children (96.9%) their husbands (80.0%) and readily accepted assistance with housework (69.2%). The emotional trauma experienced by these women was  primarily responsible for the majority (72.3%) of them refusing assistance with bathing and grooming. Many (53.9%) of them had stopped attending parties; whilst many (60.0%) had either excluded or reduced the frequency of outdoor activities e.g. games.Sexual activities were observed to be reduced among 41 out of the 42 women of child bearing age and non-existent in the elderly and the widows. Some women reduced the frequency of sex because they attributed the need for mastectomy to sex-related activities and therefore wanted to "protect" the other breast from disease. None had bilateral mastectomy. Peri-operative management showed that all women had skin care but only 22 (33.8%) were pre-operatively educated on the methods of improving their post-operative body image. Of those that were educated 13(60.0%) had a positive perception of mastectomy.In conclusion, the study observed that there is an important need to make health education an integral part of peri-operative care of patients admitted for mastectomy to enable them improves on their post-operative appearance.|Theses Collection|Mastectomy/post-mastectomy patients/radiotherapy clinic/emotional trauma/social functions/Sexual activities/bilateral mastectomy/Peri-operative management/ health education *||||||Oseni, Mufutau Adebayo|M|The pronunciation of English by journalistists of Osun State Broadcasting Corporation||||||M.A. English|R.O.

For this reason, the two aspects as used by Nigerian journalists in the electronic medium of mass communication are examined in this work. Specifically the objective of the research is to know how these features of English phonology are put to use by Nigerian journalists who broadcast in English in Osun State Broadcasting Corporation (OSBC).To do this, five English phonemes whose articulations are believed to be difficult for the majority of Nigerian speakers of English, including journalists, were examined in the broadcasts of the journalists in the first aspect of the study. The five phonemes examined are the voiced dental fricative sound /d//, the voiced Iabio-dental fricative sound /v/, the voiced alveolar fricative sound the central half-open short vowel or schwa / ; t ) / and the central half-open long vowel /:/. I n the second aspect of the study, ten polysyllabic words were selected and tested for stress placement in the broadcasts of the journalists.The findings from the research confirm that the journalist; pronounce different phonemes available in their Mother Tongue (MT} in place of the ones in their broadcasts. Also, they stress syllables that should normally remain unstressed and unstressed those that should be stressed in the majority of the English words in their broadcasts.This research work, therefore, on account of its findings, arrived at the conclusion that the journalists, like other categories of Nigerian speakers of English, neither pronounce the tested phonemes well nor stress English words correctly at all times|Theses Collection|Phoneme/word stress placement in English/oral communication/English language/Nigerian journalists/mass communication/English phonology/Osun State Broadcasting Corporation (OSBC)/Mother Tongue/polysyllabic words*||||||Jimoh, Mahboob Adekilekun|M|Vegetation and trace metal content of plant species in Itagunmodi gold deposit area of Osun State||||||M.Sc.

The objectives of the study were to describe the current state of the vegetation and determine the trace element concentrations of some plant species and soil in order to determine the impact of gold mining in the area.Four sites viz: currently under mining; mined and abandoned with forest degradation; mined and abandoned with deforestation; and unmined (control) were selected for the study. Sample plot, 20m x 20m, was established in each site. In each plot, all plant species were identified to species level. All woody plants = 1.5m high and girth size 7.0cm were completely enumerated. Their heights and girths were measured. Species richness and diversity, and number of genera and families were established. Density, basal area and volume of wood of trees were calculated. Litter cover and standing crop of litter were estimated. The leaves and fruits of commonly occurring plant species, litter samples and soil samples at 0-15cm depth were randomly collected and analysed for content of lead, cadmium, mercury, and iron. The data were analysed using parametric statistics.Results showed a total of 223 woody individuals per 0.06ha representing 50 species, 46 genera and 24 families occurring in the study area. Unmined site has the highest tree density while the mined and abandoned with deforestation site has the lowest. Shannon-Wiener's index of diversity (3.08) and Menhinick's index of species richness (0.46) were highest in the unmined site. There were significant differences in tree height and girth among the four sites at P 0.05. The control site has the highest volume of wood (1307.4 m3ha-1). The mined and abandoned site with forest degradation has the highest basal area (78.3 m2ha-`). Percentage litter cover was highest in the site currently under mining dominated by Theobroma cacao and Cola nitida. Though the standing crop of litter (816.6 kgha-l) in the unmined site is the highest among the four sites, there was no significant difference (P= 0.05) among litter standing crop of the unmined, currently under mining and the mined and abandoned with forest degradation sites. Soil pH (6.64-6.91) showed that the soils are acidic. Soils and litter of the mined sites have higher content of trace elements than that of the unmined site. There were significant differences (P=0.01) in the trace element contents of Manihot esculentus, Cola nitida and Elaeis guineesis growing in the unmined site compared to each of the mined sites.It is deduced that there is drastic reduction in the vegetal cover, and there is contamination of soils and plant species of the three mined sites compared to the unmined (control) site. It is therefore necessary to closely monitor the miners and fully enforce statutes that can engender sustainable mining operations that will not have adverse impact on the environment of the area.|Theses Collection|Vegatation/Itagunmodi gold deposit/Osun State/trace metal content/plant species/forest degradation/basal area/Theobroma cacao/Cola nitida/Manihot esculentus/Elaeis guineesis/vegetal cover*||||||Ijabadeniyi, Olasupo Augustine|M|Evaluation of the National Programme on Immunization coverage in Owo local government area, Ondo State, Nigeria. 1991 -1997||||||M.Sc.

Questions asked were those relating to knowledge of mothers about National Programme on immunization; access of mothers to immunization services; attitudes and value systems of mothers; infant immunization status using mothers of 12-23 months old children; reasons for immunization failure and evaluating the immunization status of mothers (Tetanus Toxoid) using mothers of children 0 - 11 months old.Opinions of health workers randomly selected from the eleven health districts were sought on source of vaccines, adequacy of the quantity supplied, cold chain system/ storage facilities; adequacy of manpower/material resources, record keeping and staff development training programme.The study in its findings revealed that formal education is highly significant in achieving high level immunization status. Eighty seven (82.8%) of mothers of 0-11 months old children had formal education while 83 (79.0%) of mothers of 12-23 months old children had formal education which could have been responsible for the high level immunization status for infants.There was gross under utilization of private health institutions in providing immunization service. Only about 2.0% of mothers utilized this source of health care.Poor access to immunization services in terms of distance, costs and time were responsible for the drop-outs recorded. About 58.0% of the respondents claimed that the supplies of vaccines were inadequate which could have been attributed to the drop-outs recorded. The coverage level (88.6%) was highly encouraging since the infant immunization status of the fully immunized were confirmed mostly though cards plus date and the presence of scar. Although there was no proper record keeping in terms of cards on the part of the mothers as only 44 (41.9%) could produce cards as evidence of having received TT1 vaccine.The study also revealed that the level of training embarked upon by the local government council for staff was not enough. In the implementation of immunization programme, it was discovered that there were no enough infrastructural facilities that could enhance the level of efficiency. It was also found that the mothers (i.e. mothers of 0 - 11 and 12 - 23 months) were different in their knowledge, attitudes and access to immunization. Also there were differences in potency of vaccines supplied, while on the other hand, potency did not differ with the sources.Therefore, among measures recommended for improvement of knowledge, attitudes and access of mothers to immunization programme are needed for intensive health education directed at mothers since this will improve the level of awareness about immunization; contact periods and time must be reduced or limited since drop-outs are especially due to the tight schedules of mothers, distance and cost of transportation. Staff development programmes such as seminar, workshops and conferences must be organized periodically so as to keep the health workers atuned to new strategies and inventions.|Theses Collection|National Programme on Immunization/immunization services/staff development training programme/formal education/health institutions/TT1 vaccine/ infrastructural facilities *||||||Abimbola, Oluremi Matthew|M|Interrelationships of phosphorus sorption characteristics, chemical properties and P.availability in igneous/metamorphic forest soils of southwestern Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

Soil chemical properties were related to the P sorption parameters, and the relationships were later used for P-sorption characteristics prediction. The equilibrium solution phosphorous concentration (ESPC) that gave optimum uptake by maize was determined. The ESPC was also correlated with soil chemical properties and P-sorption parameters.Adsorption capacities at 0.2ppm ESPC ranged between 2.5 µg/g and 14.0 ìg/g and were in order Ondo > Fagbo > Iregun > Iwo (C-02) > Iwo (C-25) > Obayantor. Using Langmuir plot, all soils exhibited two populations of adsorption sites each. Initial adsorption maximum had significant positive association with pH in CaCl2 (r = 0.82), Mg (r = 0.96*), sum of bases (r = 0.81*), ECEC (r = 0.82*) and free silica (r = 0.87*). Total adsorption maxima had significant positive association with organic carbon (r = 0.85*) and organic matter (r = 0.85). Phosphorous requirement to maintain 0.2ppm ESPC had a significant negative association with pH in water (r = -0.82) and pH in CaCl2 (r = - 0.90*). The soil pH in CaC12, ECEC, organic matter, sesquioxides of Al, Fe and Si, and extractable micronutrients (Fe, Zn and Mn) could be used to predict all P-sorption characteristics except the initial and final binding energy.Optimum P sorption was obtained at ESPC of 0.213ppm, 0.093ppm, 0.086ppm, 0.119ppm and 0.075ppm for Ondo, Fagbo, Iregun, Iwo (C-02), Iwo (C-25) and Obayantor soils respectively.

Both Primary and Secondary sources of data collection were employed for the study. Primary data include questionnaire, structured interview and focused grouped discussion. Secondary information was generated from Library documents and relevant records available in NNPC.The study among others revealed that although the military made some positive contributions within the context of industrial relations, their negative roles on same outweighed the good contributions. The study also discovered that the State of Labour - Management relations in Nigeria as a whole and particularly in the oil industry under the various Military regimes was a failure. The promulgation of obnoxious, punitive and draconian decrees did not help the matter. The study revealed further that the major problem confronting the Military within the framework of industrial relations is the autocratic rather than democratic ways by which they address labour issues. The study further discovered that the Military has no respect for human dignity and the rule of law as attested to data collected. It was also observed that the promulgation of unpleasant decrees by the Military leadership to deal with labour issues did not prevent strike, but rather aggravates it, as workers are at times adamant until their demands are met. Moreover, lack of autonomy in the recruitment of key management staff and poor financing among others, are some of the problems hampering the operation of NNPC.Finally, the study recommended several solutions.

Concentrations of suspended particulate matter in the ambient air were determined and compared to the standard set by Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA). The particulate matter samples collected were analyzed using x-ray fluorescence (XRF) analytical technique to comprehensively determine the elemental composition of the suspended particulate matter. The measured concentration of lead in the ambient environment was found to be much higher than the limit set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). Risk assessment was carried out to examine the medical implication of the high concentration levels on the health of the target group. Total suspended particulate (TSP) matter values obtained within the working environment range from 70µg/m3 to 7.963µg/m3, while chemical composition values were obtained for the following elements: K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb. Of all these elements, lead was found to be the most abundant, with concentration values between 2.98µg/m3 to 538.47µg/m3.From these results, it can be inferred that according to the study conducted by Thomson and Harrison (Romo-Kroger, 1996), diseases attributed to the overabundance of lead in the body may be common among the workers of this secondary lead smelting company.|Theses Collection|Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA)/air quality/x-ray fluorescence (XRF)/United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)/World Health Organisation (WHO)/Risk assessment/concentration levels/Total suspended particulate/chemical composition/diseases/lead smelting company*||||||Dike, Kingsley Nzelegu|M|Human rights and national security in Nigeria (1985 -1998)||||||M.Sc.

The primary sources include:(a)	Interviews with officials of the different layers of National Security organs like the Nigeria Police, State Security Service (SSS), the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI), the Ministries of Internal Affairs and Justice.(b)	Interviews with relevant officials of Non-Governmental Human Rights Organizations like the Civil Liberties Organization (CLO) and Amnesty International. Officials of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) and notable Human Rights activists like Chief Gani Fawehinmi were also interviewed.(c) Academics who are specialists in Human Rights Studies.The secondary sources are books, journals, newsmagazines, newspapers and publications of Human Rights organizations.The study revealed that: First, there were gross Human Rights violations and abuses under the regimes of Generals Ibrahim Babangida and Sani Abacha. Second, that the logic of military dictatorship particularly its fixation with security and the interpretation of the National Security of the state to mean the survival of the regime in power made Human Rights violations inevitable during the two regimes. Third, the emergence of a strong, vibrant and enlightened civil society would make it impossible for any government to exercise arbitrary powers. Fourth, a government and institutions of the state, can only endure if those who enforce the laws of the land have the confidence and support of the public they serve. Our conclusion is that nothing short of the institutionalization of democratic civil governance in Nigeria with its emphasis on the rule of law, would mediate the discord between National Security and Human Rights.|Theses Collection|Human Rights violations in Nigeria/National Security/regimes of Generals Ibrahim Babangida and Sani Abacha/Nigeria Police/State Security Service (SSS)/the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI)/the Ministries of Internal Affairs and Justice/Amnesty International.

It also determined the level of preference for rabbit meat as compared to other conventional sources of meat.The study was carried out in twenty-one selected villages in Osun and Oyo States. A structured interview schedule was used to elicit current information from fifty-one rabbit keepers; directly through personal interviews between March and May, 1999. The baseline data were collected in 1984 to which current data were compared. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data and Analysis of Variance was used to test the hypotheses.The results showed that the level of knowledge of management practices of rabbit keepers was higher after (mean = 58.22) than before the introduction of improved rabbit keeping practices (mean = 56.98). The level of knowledge of breeding and kindling practices of rabbit keepers was higher after (mean = 44.76) than before the introduction of improved rabbit keeping practices (mean = 38.2). All of the respondents, (100%) before and most of the respondents (92.2%) after introduction of improved rabbit keeping practices indicated that there was no belief and value constraints against rabbit keeping and use for food. The level of preference (<50%) for rabbit meat was still low among the farmers. The major problems militating against the spread of rabbit keeping were as follows: that Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources had not paid particular attention to rabbit keeping; farmers were generally ignorant of how to keep rabbits; and rabbit meal was not a popular food item in the study area. The result of testing hypotheses using ANOVA technique at 0.01 level of significance, showed that there was a significant difference between knowledge of management practices of rabbit keepers before and after introduction of improved rabbit keeping practices (F = 13.13); there was a significant difference between knowledge of breeding aid kindling practices of rabbit keepers before and after introduction of improved rabbit keeping practices (F = 77.02). However, there was no significant difference in attitude of rabbit keepers (F = 5.46) towards rabbit keeping before and after introduction of improved rabbit keeping practices. There was also no significant difference in amount of subsidized agricultural inputs enjoyed by rabbit keepers (F = 1.35) before and after introduction of improved rabbit keeping practices to farmers in Oyo and Osun States. The hypotheses further revealed that there were significant differences between socio-economic characteristics of rabbit keepers before and after introduction of improved rabbit keeping practices. Farm size, labour size, extension contacts and cosmopoliteness decreased while level of income and participation in social organisations increased. In conclusion, the knowledge of rabbit keeping practices of rabbit keepers had increased considerably after the introduction of improved rabbit keeping practices and there was no belief and value constraint against rabbit keeping and use for food.|Theses Collection|Rabbit breeding/kindling and management practices among farmers/rabbit meat/illiteracy amog farmers/agricultural inputs/level of income/improved rabbit keeping practices *||||||Omotosho, Lawrence Olaleye|M|Design of communications network to support hospital information system (HIS)||||||M.Sc.

Stomachs of the fish specimens were removed and the stomach contents identified under a binocular compound microscope. The fish species captured during this period of study were Gnathonemus senegalensis, Alestes longipinnis, Chrysichthys auratus, Schilbe mystus, Ctenopoma kingsleyae, Hemichromis fasciatus, Tilapia zillii, Tilapia mariae, Sarotherodon galilaeus and Barbus callipterus.The study revealed that T. zillii, T. mariae and S. galilaeus were herbivores and their main food was macrophytes and algae. H. fasciatus, G. senegalensis, C. kingsleyae and S. mystus were carnivorous in their feeding habits and they fed mainly on insects and fish. B. callipterus, A. longipinnis and C. auratus were omnivorous and their diets consisted of both plant and animal materials. Seasonal variation in food consumed was observed for most of the fishes. In the rainy season the fishes fed on a wider variety of food items while in the dry season they consumed fewer food items. The food consumed by the fishes also varied in relation to size.The fish species of Owalla reservoir and their food organisms were grouped into various trophic levels. The producers were observed to be the higher plants, algae and photosynthetic flagellates. The primary consumers, which fed mostly on plant material, were A. longipinnis, B. callipterus, T. zillii, T. mariae, and S. galilaeus.

A number of pyrimido [1,2-a] benzimidazoles have been reported to possess antihypertensive, fungicidal, virucidal, anti-inflammatory, antithyroid and CNS depressant activities.In the syntheses of new pyrimido [1,2-a]benzimidazole analogues in this work, a number of precursors were prepared and subsequently condensed with 2-aminobenzimidazole. The precursors included fourteen chalcones and other 1,3-diaryl-2-propene-l-ones, five isoflavones, ten I,3-diarylpropenoic acids and three B-diketones using known synthetic methods.While the condensation reactions of 2-aminobenzimidazole with 1 ,3-diaryl-2-propen- l -ones in refluxing dimethylformamide (DM F) yielded eight new 2,4-diarylpyrimido[1,2-a]benzimidazoles in 46-64% yield, the novel reaction of isoflavones with 2-aminobenzimidazole gave two new phenolic 3,4-diarylpyrimido[1,2-a]benzimidazoles in 52 and 67% yield respectively. The reaction of I,3-diarylpropenoic acids with 2-aminobenzimidazole afforded two new 2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimido[1,2-a]benzimidazoles in 68-73% yield.1,3-Diaryl-2-propen-l-ones and isoflavones as well as their condensation products 2,4- and phenolic 3,4-diarylpyrimido[1,2-a]benzimidazoles were examined for antimicrobial and molluscicidal activities. None of the tested products showed activity against E. coil but 4,4'- dimethoxychalcone showed activity against Staph. aureus, Ps. aeruginosa and C. pseudoiropicalis. Only 2-(2-aminophenyl)-4-(3,=1,5-trimethoxyphcnyl), 2-( 3-mcthoxvphenyl)-4-(3,4-dimethoxphenyl), 2-phenyl-4-(2-thienyl), and 2-(4-dimethylamino-phenyl)-4-(2-furyl)pyrimido[1,2-a]benzimidazoles showed more potent antibacterial activity against Staph. aureus than the corresponding chalcones. Interestingly, both the 3,4-diaryI analogues 3-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-(2-hydroxyphenyl)pyrimido[I,2-a]benz-imidaz_ole and 3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-(2-hydroxyphenyl)pyrimido[I,2-a]benzimidazole showed activity against Staph. aureus with higher inhibitory capabilities than their precursor isoflavones.The comparative molluscicidal activity study showed that the isoflavones were more potent than their corresponding chalcones. Their condensation with 2-aminobenzimidaz_ole led to pyrimido [1,2-a] benzimidazoles with reduction in the molluscicidal activity. However, the results of the molluscicidal studies of isoflavones in this work presented new findings as they showed that the isoflavones have strong molluscicidal properties.This work demonstrated the versatility of 2-aminobenzimidazole as a synthetic precursor to pyrimidobenzimidazoles.|Theses Collection|Tricyclic N-Heterocucles/benzimidazole nucleus/pharmacophore/antithyroid/CNS depressant/molluscicidal activity/chalcones/isoflavones/4,4'- dimethoxychalcone/dimethylformamide/pyrimidobenzimidazoles*||||||Taiwo, Elijah Adekunle|M|Variation of separation efficiency with dynamic liquid hold-up in a packed column||||||Ph.D. Chemical Engineering|S.O.

Distillates were sampled along the pre-marked locations of the bed during the distillation to determine the concentration, density and viscosity changes of the separating species along the packed section of the column. Temperature distribution along the bed height was equally measured. Three binary systems (acetone-methanol, acetone-ethanol, methanol-ethanol) and a ternary system (acetone-methanol-ethanol) were used in the study. The dynamic liquid hold-up in each designed segment of the packed column was measured.Experimental data showed that the dynamic liquid hold-up was resident in the lower portion of the column and the magnitude rose with decreasing systems volatility. The highest measured values of 0.03447m3/m3 for methanol-ethanol, 0.02935m3/m3 for acetone-methanol, and 0.02271m3/m3 for acetone-ethanol were obtained for the binary systems and 0.02697 was obtained for acetone-methanol-ethanol ternary system. When tested on the experimental data for the binary systems, the developed correlation in this study was within a deviation less than 3.5% for the hydrodynamics-based model and less than 8.5% for the dimensional analysis-based model. For the ternary system, the test of the experimental data on the models gave the highest percentage deviations of 0.40 and 4.60 for hydrodynamics and dimensional analysis based models respectively. A general decline in optimum performance as dynamic liquid hold-up increased was significant at higher number of transfer units for all the systems examined. The performance of both binary and ternary systems decreased with increasing column bulk liquid density.The application of this consideration for dynamic liquid hold-up in packed distillation column design will enhance column performance, and circumvent the need for overdesign provision|Theses Collection|Dynamic liquid hold-up/distillation/hydrodynamics/volatility/ternary system/liquid density/acetone-methanol-ethanol/concentration profile*||||||Afolabi, Magaret Olubunmi|F|Evaluation of drug utilisation pattern in the revolving funds scheme of a University Teaching Hospital Pharmavy shop||||||M.Phil.

The DRF was based on the principles and objectives of the National Essential Drugs Programme.In conducting the evaluation, four aspects of the activities of the shop were investigated: the pattern of drug use, the pharmacy unit workload, the level of patients' satisfaction with the services provided and how the objectives of the DRF were achieved. The study utilized the basic ingredients of formative evaluation.The subjects of the study were 364 out-patients selected by random sampling and the nine members of staff of the shop, including the Assistant Director of Pharmaceutical Services (ADP) and the Principal Pharmacist directly in charge of the shop.  A self developed and validated questionnaire, the Patients' Satisfaction Survey (PSS), was administered on the patients over a period of two weeks. Also, the two key members of staff of the shop were interviewed using a Structured Interview Schedule (SIS) to find out the performance of the shop in relation to the objectives the DRF. Furthermore, the Prescribing Indicator Form (PIF) was used to monitor the various processes involved in attending to patient with hospital prescriptions.  These processes were observed, timed and recorded in order to measure the workload.Finally, documentary sources, especially previous prescriptions were systematically sampled and examined in order to determine the drug use pattern. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics content analysis and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).The results of the study revealed that over 80% of the prescribed drugs were available at the pharmacy shop and 79% of these were prescribed in their generic names. The number of drugs prescribed per patient and the cost of drugs per encounter tended to increase with the age of patients with the average drug cost per encounter being N153.00. Bulk compounding took the highest man - hours among the activities of the shop while recording and billing of prescribed drugs took the least. About 82% of the patients were generally satisfied with the services provided at the shop, especially the quality of the drugs and the 24-hour service.

Both plants are used individually in ethnomedicine for treating gastro-intestinal disorders, rheumatism and various diseases of microbial origin. In addition, a recipe comprising the stem barks of both plants in used in Nigeria herbal medicine to treat peptic ulcer. While a number of saponins (leaf) and cytotoxic lignans (stem) have been previously reported from S. araliacea, B. dalzielii has been hitherto unexplored chemically.Previous work had focused on the Indian specie, B. carterii and the popular North-East African commercial sources of frankincense  B. carterii and B. frereana. The present study was therefore aimed at examining the plants for biological properties relevant to their ethnomedical uses as well as contributing to the knowledge of their chemistry.The dried powederd stem bark of B.dalzelii and S. araliacea were separately extracted with 50% ethanol. Each extract was fractionated into hexane, ethyl acetate and non-butanol respectively. The fractions obtained, along with the extracts were subjected to antioxidant (potential radial scavenging), antimicrobial, spasmolytic, and cytotoxicity (brine shrimp lethality) tests. Fractionation of antimicrobial active fractions using various chromatographic methods yielded pure compounds, which were characterized using spectroscopic methods.The ethyl acetate fraction of B. dalzelii bark afforded a novel stilbene glycoside, (E) -3  hydroxyl-4- methanoxy-5- [O-á - L  rhamnopyranosyl-(1> 6)-â-D- glucopyranosyloxy] stilbene which showed weak antibacterial (MIC> 400ìg/mL) and moderate antioxidant activities. Other compounds isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction include incensole  a cembrane diterpenoid, â sitosterol and phenolic compounds  protacatechuic acid,gallic acid and ethyl gallate. The three phenolic compounds accounts for the antimicrobial property of the bark. In addition, they exhibited strong antioxidant properties. Incensole showed antibacterial activity only in bioautographic screening. GC-MS analysis of the volatile oil (45 min, hydrodistillation) of B. dalzelii gum resis revealed the presence of the following monoterpenes: á pinene (57.9%), camphene (35.4%), â- pinene (0.9%), camphor (0.7%), mycene (0.6%) and limonene (0.6%).However, the oil showed no antimicrobial properties. In contrast, the oil obtained after 4th hydrodistillation showed antibacterial and antifungal properties. The dicholoromethane extract of the resin residue after 45min hydrodistillation yielded incensole and a triterpenoid, 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-â-boswellic acid. This boswellic acid, previously reported from B. serrata and B. carteri is known to be the most potent specific inhibitor of leukotriene biosynthesis. Indeed, both the neutral and acidic fractions of the extract, at a dose of 1mg/kg ( i.p), inhibited carrageenan- induced rat paw oedema (65.5 and 74>65 inhibition) but shewed no antioxidant property.The ethyl acetate fraction of S. araliacea bark yielded proptocatechuic acid as the main antimicrobial principle. The saponins mixture from the bark showed strong spasmolytic (antihistaminic) and anti-inflammatory (77.7% inhibition) activities.The spectrum of biological activities demonstrated by the extracts and isolates in this study seems to justify some of the traditional uses and suggests their great potential for further development.|Theses Collection|Boswellia dalzielii Hutch/Steganotaenia araliacea Hochst/West African Savannah/ethnomedicine/plants/herbal medicine/antioxidant/cytotoxicity/spasmolytic/chromatographic/anti-inflammatory activities/hydrodistillation/incensole *||||||Umoru, Lasisi Ejibunu|M|A study of corrosion of materials in a tar-sand digester||||||Ph.D. Metallurgical & Materials Engineering|A.A.

The aim was to identify which of them or their combinations would be most suitable as construction materials for the tar sand digester.The corrosion experiments for the various materials were done by the non-electrochemical immersion technique and the surface analysis by optical and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) techniques. The corrosion rate was expressed in mils per year (mpy). The spectroscopic analyses of the materials for this work were carried out using the Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA). The methodology adopted included investigation of the influence of weld type and post-weld heat treatments on the corrosion of the AISI 321 stainless steel. Furthermore, the influence of sodium carbonate and sodium hydrogen carbonate on the corrosivity of the environment was also investigated particularly with respect to the chosen AISI 321 austenitic stainless steel. In addition, the effects of different microstructures of the ST-60 Mn steel on their corrosion and corrosion wear resistance in the tar sand environment were studied. The heat treatment procedures considered included annealing, normalizing, quench hardening, tempering, austempering and martempering. Also investigated were the corrosion wear properties of the AISI 321 stainless steel and the ST--60 Mn steel with the help of a pin-on block wear testing equipment.The results of this study showed that the aluminum alloy and galvanized steel had relatively low corrosion resistance in the tar sand digester environment. The ST-60 Mn steel with austempering heat treatment evolved a bainitic structure that was not only strong and tough but was capable of exhibiting good corrosion wear resistance in the environment. Based on corrosion rate measurement, all the stainless steels considered in this work had corrosion rates that were less than 5mpy. The SEM analyses of the surfaces of the stainless steels, however, revealed the great tendency in them to exhibit crevice and pitting corrosions. Only the stabilized AISI 321 showed little tendency in this respect. The results of the weld and post-weld heat treatments conducted showed that the butt joint electric arc welding with or without water quenching of the component would suffice as the best fabrication technique for the construction of the tar sand digester.It can therefore be concluded that either AISI 321 stainless steel, austempered ST-60 Mn steels or their combination by appropriate welding procedure will be very suitable for the construction of a tar-sand digester.|Theses Collection|Corrosion properties/aluminum alloy/two austenitic stainless steels (AISI 304 and AISI 321)/hot water tar sand digester environment/construction materials/electron microscopic (SEM) techniques/spectroscopic analyses/Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA)/galvanized steel/bainitic structure/an ST-60 Mn steel   *||||||Owoeye, Saibu Ainde|M|African healer- prophets in selected independent churches in Yorubaland, 1963 -1998||||||Ph.D. Religious Studies|D.O.

The study sought to find out the religious, socio-economic and political impact of the activities of healer-prophets on the society. The continuing emphasis on healing among contemporary healer-prophets made the study imperative.The study employed a variety of methodologies. Firstly, the phenomenological approach was used to examine the essence of the healing activities of the selected healer-prophets. Secondly, the study involved extensive use of published books, articles in learned journals and magazines dealing with healing and prophetism in the African context. Thirdly, the participation-observation method was used to obtain a first hand account of the healers' activities.The study discovered that the healer-prophets emphasized the healing of curses, remedies to personal problems and socio-economic and political problems of the country. In addition, people who had suffered from physical disabilities, demon-possession and other incurable diseases were healed. The study also brought out in detail the essence of prophecy and the healing ministry as well as their impacts on society. For instance, many political dignitaries including some royal fathers and governors were not only healed of their ailments through the prophets' ministrations but were warned against abuse of office through their prophetic utterances. Also, as part of their duties, the prophets prayed to avert civil war in the country especially during the 1993 annulment of the presidential election's results.The study concluded that the social upheaval in contemporary Nigeria and the lack of appropriate remedies from the government have made healing prominent among religious groups. The study has thus established faith-healing as one of the functional activities of the African Independent Churches in Yorubaland.|Theses Collection|Faith-healing/Yorubaland/religion/healer-prophets/political impact/physical disabilities/demon-possession/prophecy/African Independent Churches in Yorubaland*||||||Olowoyo, Joshua Oluwole|M|Effects of agricultural activities on phosphorus contents in streams draining into Opa reservoir, O.A.U.

Nigeria was investigated from March, 1999 to January. 2000.The agricultural landuse within the study area was mapped by active survey of the entire area. Thereafter, soil samples were taken from the landuse units viz: mixed cropping (maize and cassava), horticultural garden and the fallow land/bush regrowth. Composite soil samples were collected for laboratory analysis following bulking and homogenisation of ten core soil samples. Soil sampling depths were 0-15cm (topsoil) and 1 5-30cm (subsoil) and the samplings were carried out during the wet (July 1999) and dry (.January 2000) season periods. The samples were analysed for soil pit, particle size distribution, organic matter content, available phosphorus and erodibility index. Water samples were collected from various stations along the Opa River, Opa Reservoir and the tributary streams in April (early wet season). July (wet season). October 1999 (early dry season) and January 2000 (dry season) and analysed for BOD5. DO. PO4, organic matter and pH. Bottom sediment was collected from the reservoir and analysed for the same parameters as the soil. Student t-test and analysis of variance were carried out to determine difference ii phosphorus loading between landuse patterns and water sampling stations while correlation analysis was used to determine strength of associations.The results obtained indicated that soil pH ranged from 5.5 to 6. l (mixed cropping), 5.5 to 6.1 (horticultural garden) and 5.6 to 6.4 (fallow/bush regrowth). The soil organic matter varied from 1.3% to 2.7%; 1.1% to 2.3%, and 1.4% to 2.7% in the mixed cropping, horticultural garden and fallow/bush regrowth respectively. The corresponding values of available phosphorus in soil were 10.9mg/kg to 19.1 mg/kg. 8.9mg/kg to 21.4mg/keg and 9.0mg/kg to19.3mg/kg. Soil organic matter and available phosphorus showed significant patterns of seasonal and profile variations and correlated positively with each other (r =0.45). Mean erodibility index of the soils were in the order: mixed cropping (7.33) > horticultural gardens (6.l)> fallow land (2.7). Water pH in the Opa river, reservoir and the tributary streams ranged from 6.0 to 7.9. DO was from 3.2 mg/l to 8.2mg/l, ROD; from 0.4mg/l to 7.4mg/l. PO4 from 0.2mg/l to 0.3mg/l and organic matter from 0.9mg/l to 2.8mg/l, each showing a considerable pattern of seasonal variation.Compared with the WHO standards for fresh inland waters, PO4- was high in Opa reservoir but there is no reason to believe that the reservoir has attained a eutrophic state. Since phosphorus loading potential was higher in cultivated than non-cultivated areas, it is important that the zero-planting policy of the university is maintained to protect the reservoir.|Theses Collection|Agricultural landuse/opa river/phosphorus/Opa reservoir/soil sample/wet & dry season/soil organic matter/soil pH/mixed cropping/horticultural garden/fallow/bush regrowth/eutrophic*||||||Akinmusire, Thompson Olubunmi|M|Interpretation of three-dimensional (3D) seismic data over Utai/Usari oil field, offshore, Niger Delta||||||M.Sc.

The mapped seismic horizons divide the study area into five seismic layers. Layer-1 constitutes the Agbada Formation with the sandy Benin Formation occupying the shallow parts of the layer. Layers-2, 3 and 4 belong to the Agbada Formation while layer-5 falls within the Akata Formation.Layer-1 possess a thickness of 1700 m and interval velocity ranging from 1043 m/s to 1143 m/s. Layer-2 has a thickness range of 230 m to 800 m and its interval velocity ranges from 2778 m/s to 3026 m/s. This layer constitutes the hydrocarbon reservoir in the study area. Layer-3 has a thickness range of between 110 m and 515 m with an interval velocity of 2990 m/s to 3235 m/s. The thickness of layer-4 varies from 100m to 740 m and its interval velocity ranges from 3215 m/s to 3419 m/s. Layer-5 extends from a depth of 2900 m downwards.Qualitative interpretation of the borehole logs revealed the presence of hydrocarbon in separate sands intercalated with shale within the reservoir. A gas-oil contact was delineated at a depth of 1530 m. A thick shale sequence recognized to be the Qua lboe shale was observed in the Utai-01 and Usari EE-01 wells.Quantitative interpretation of the hydrocarbon bearing zone of the reservoir gave average porosity (b ), water saturation (Sw) and hydrocarbon saturation (Shc) of 27.2 %,25 % and 75 % respectively. The obtained average hydrocarbon moveability index of 0.88 implied that the reservoir contained moveable hydrocarbon. The isochron map of the reservoir revealed an anticlinal and a faulted anticlinal structure while the isopach map revealed a northwest-southeast dip of the reservoir respectively.The study of seismic structural maps for the area showed the hydrocarbon bearing zones occurred within formations of seismic interval velocity of 2680-2780 m/s, wave slowness of 360-373 ,u s/m and fluid velocity between 1280 and 1370 m/s.

This study was an attempt to integrate the interpretation of seismic velocities and wellbore measurements to predict reservoir characteristics in areas beyond well and detailed stratigraphic control.Eleven faults were identified and three seismic horizons (A, B and C) mapped on the seismic sections at average depths of 1872.4m, 2922.5m and 3754.2m respectively, dividing the study area into four seismic layers. Layer one with an average depth to bottom of 1872.4m lies within the Benin Formation. Layers 2 and 3 are within the Agbada Formation while layer 4 grades from the Agbada into the Akata Formation. Geometry of the relevant horizons was deduced from isochron, isodepth and isopach maps.Qualitative interpretation of available borehole log data revealed the presence of six hydrocarbon hearing sand units intercalated with shale within layer 3. Shale content by volume of between 0-30%, an average porosity of 22% and hydrocarbon saturation of between 62-99% were estimated from the well logs.The relationship of seismic velocities and sonic log velocities provided the basis for using seismic velocities to predict reservoir characteristics. Prediction of the lateral variability of the reservoirs was carried out by generating empirical relations which relate log-derived sonic interval velocities to Dix interval velocities at well IN-1. The reliability of these empirical relations was tested by employing the empirical relations in well I-1, which was 2.6 km from well IN-1. The results from well I-1 showed a correlation coefficient of 97% between sonic log velocities measured within the well and sonic log velocities predicted from Dix interval velocities. This implied that the empirical relations were suitable prediction tools.Reservoir distribution maps were prepared from predicted sonic interval velocities and used to study the reservoir variability and to delimit possible hydrocarbon-hearing zones. In conclusion, calibrating seismic velocities with sonic log velocities was a reliable tool for laterally predicting reservoir characteristics. Three-dimensional (3-D) seismic data should be acquired to provide a more rigorous detailed velocity analysis over the field.|Theses Collection|Reservoir/OML 33 western Niger Delta/geophysical well logs/Gamma Ray/Spontaneous Potential/Resistivity/Shell Petroleum Development Company Nigeria Limited/seismic velocities/isochron/isodepth/isopach maps/shale content/sonic log velocities/Dix interval velocities*||||||Aborisade, Caleb Ayoade|M|Qualitative and quantitative analysis of backscattered x-ray photons from different materials||||||M.Sc.

Bioremediation has been suggested as one of the cost-effective and environmentally safe remedies for oil contamination of soil. Enumeration of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms is important both to determine the potential for removal of oil through microbial degradation and to assess the amount of oil pollution that has occurred. The aim of this study is to isolate and enumerate hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria using different enumeration techniques and to carry out laboratory-scale oil biodegradation experiments using starter culture mixtures isolated from polluted sites. The study was carried out using contaminated soils from three oil-producing sites in Delta State.Total viable heterotrophic, aerobic bacteria in the soil samples were determined by plating on plate-count-agar after which hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were also enumerated by plating on solidified mineral salts oil media (SMO), silica-gel-oil media (SGO), and inoculating Bushnell Haas liquid media. A comparison was carried out to ascertain the most suitable enumeration technique in relation to the area of study. The dominant bacteria from the petroleum-contaminated soils were isolated and identified. These bacteria as mono-cultures and mixed cultures were used for laboratory-scale oil biodegradation experiment, which was evaluated using gas chromatography {GC). Liquid medium containing 1% crude oil as substrate gave the highest enumeration using the modified most probable number (MPN) method. Counts of petroleum degraders obtained using liquid medium were in most cases higher than those obtained from the SMO and SGO media.Of 21 presumptive isolates tested, twelve grew on petrol supplemented medium and thirteen grew on crude oil supplemented medium. Two bacteria, Pseudomonas sp. P3121 and Bacillus sp. B903 from the thirteen bacteria that grew on crude oil medium were selected due to their efficient degradative potential of Nigerian light crude oil, Forcados blend under laboratory conditions. The Pseudomonas sp. P3121 showed a higher ability in degrading the crude oil than the Bacillus sp. B903. This organism was able to cause a 62.14% decrease in weight of crude oil after 3 weeks of incubation, while B903 caused a weight loss of 61.56% over the same period. When both microorganisms were mixed as one culture a weight loss of 72.46% was obtained. Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus; in the ratio 0.5%:0.4%) addition to the growth medium enhanced crude oil biodegradation. In conclusion, the results obtained suggest that both microorganisms can play active roles in clearing oil spills in tropical soils, but much better results would be obtained if the two microorganisms are mixed together in a nutrient-enriched medium.|Theses Collection|Crude oil spillage/environmental problem/Bioremediation/hydrocarbon/pollution/hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria/heterotrophic/aerobic bacteria/silica-gel-oil media/mineral salts oil media/Bushnell Haas liquid media/gas chromatography/Pseudomonas sp/Bacillus sp/Nutrients  *||||||Dokun-Onibokun, Oluwafunke Oluwatosin|F|A linguistic-stylistic study of William Golding's Lord of The Flies||||||M.A. English|C.O.

The novel, Lord of the Flies, was carefully studied and the prominent linguistic features were identified, classified, analysed and interpreted. In addition, a review of related literature was carried out.It was found that, through his use of language, Golding was able to convey his message that evil is inherent in every man. Also, it was discovered that there were reversal of roles in the text. For instance, elements of nature and inanimate objects were presented as being very active and man was seen as very passive and helpless in a world into which he was created to rule and reign as lord.The study concluded that the linguistic- stylistic approach to the study of prose fiction was of great benefit in the field of literature as well as language.|Theses Collection|Linguistic/stylistic/language/William Golding/Lord of the Flies/prose/fiction/literature*||||||Afolabi, Olusegun Matthew|M|Seismic data interpretation and estimation of speculative potentials of Odu Field, Niger Delta||||||M.Sc.

This was with the aim of mapping the subsurface geologic structures and hydrocarbon indicators, and estimating the speculative hydrocarbon accumulation in the field.Two counter-regional faults (A and C) and a crestal fault (13) were picked on the seismic sections. Eight horizons, which divided the subsurface of the study area into nine layers, were also picked. One of these layers is located in Benin and Benin/Agbada Formations; seven in Agbada Formation and the ninth is in Agbada/Akata and Akata Formations.Layers 3, 5 and 7 have interval velocities in the ranges 2404 to 2559m/s, 2432 to 2623m/s, and 2472 to 3440m/s. These layers are composed of shale and are confirmed to be non-hydrocarbon- bearing from the borehole log fluid interpretation. Layers 2, 4, 6 and 8, which are designated reservoirs-1, 2, 3, and 4 are hydrocarbon-hearing, their interval velocities range from 2387 to 252.5m/s, 2404 to 2417m/s, 1824 to 2650m/s and 2500 to 2775m/s. These producing layers are found to be of sand and shaly sand from lithologic interpretation of wireline logs. The subsurface maps (Time and Depth structural maps) reveal one major west-east trending anticlinal structure in the study area. A minor anticlinal structure closes against fault C in the southwestern part.The hydrocarbon-water contacts of the delineated reservoirs-1, 2, 3, and 4 are at depths 1701m(5580ft), 1851.4m(6074ft), 2074.2m(6805ft), and 2605.13m(8547ft) respectively. Quantitative reservoir interpretation of the borehole logs puts the average hydrocarbon saturation of the four reservoirs at 95%, 91%, 90%, and 78% respectively. The average porosities are 26.2%, 20.9%, 26.32% and 18.7%.The total hydrocarbon volume estimate is I48.4million m3. The other traps (excluding the gas bearing reservoirs) contain a total oil volume of 708.6million barrels (1 I 2.6million m3). The gas estimate is 1261.2million cubic feet (35.7million m3).In conclusion, the research project has identified two counter regional faults, a crestal fault and two major fault closures entrapping hydrocarbon in the study area.

The main tenets of traditional epistemology were formulated and Quine's criticism of traditional epistemology was examined. The thesis also attempted to show that contrary to Quine, normative issues are unavoidable in any epistemology.The methodology employed comprised philosophical argumentation, critical-conceptual analysis. Primary texts such as Quine's Word and Object, Theories and Things, Roots of Reference, The Way of Paradox and Other Essays and Ontological Relativity and Other Essays, were used to formulate Quine's view.Influential secondary texts- journals and books were also used to situate Quine's view within the debate among philosophers on the nature of epistemology. Such texts are, for example, Jaegwon Kim's "What is Naturalized Epistemology", Barry Stroud's "The Significance of Naturalized Epistemology", Morton White's "Normative Ethics, Normative Epistemology and Quine's Holism", Hilary Putnam's "Why Reason Cannot Be Naturalized", Jerry Fodor's "Dogma that Do Not Bark", Alvin Goldman's "Epistemic Folkways and Scientific Epistemology", Hilary Kornblith's "What is Naturalized Epistemology?", and "Beyond Foundationalism and Coherentism".The thesis found that:(i)	The issue of justification or the normative is a central concern of epistemology. So justification should not be jettisoned from epistemology.(ii)	Reason can be naturalized and at the same time reason can be both transcendent and immanent.(iii)	Contrary to Quine's position, it is possible for naturalized epistemology to be normative and yet not be viciously circular.The thesis concluded that naturalized epistemology is a welcome and plausible enterprise. However, naturalized epistemology should not eliminate traditional epistemology.

This syndrome coincides with the period of wide availability of these larvae in the markets. The syndrome presents with sudden onset of severe tremors and gait ataxia, the cause of which has remained unknown. The preceding consumption of these larvae led to the suspicion that a food toxin may be responsible since no other food item was common to all patients presenting the disease.The insect larvae were bought from a local market in Ile-Ife. Preliminary chemical analysis using phytochemical screening methods showed the presence of amino acids, proteins, fats and sterols. The larvae were extracted with n-pentane and ethanol, and the ethanolic extract was partitioned into ethyl acetate and water fractions. The n-pentane extract was further fractionated on mini silica gel columns using n-pentane, diethyl ether (mixtures) and ethanol. The ethyl acetate fraction was also subjected to preparative thin layer chromatography.The resulting fractions were analysed by Gas Chromatography- Electron Impact Mass Spectrometry (GC-EIMS).

The tank was filled with sand, saturated with water and its resistivity measured. The sand was then impacted with crude oil (hydrocarbon) and the resistivity measurement repeated. A wall effect test involving pole-pole array was carried out in order to determine the area within which geoelectric measurements could be taken without significant wall effect. The study was aimed at generating characteristic geoelectric signatures or patterns for different electrode arrays and evaluating the sensitivity of same over non-impacted and hydrocarbon-impacted sand formation.Five traverses (TR1  TR5) were run with Wenner, pole-dipole, pole-pole and dipole-dipole arrays. Resistivity profiles, maps and pseudosections were prepared over unimpacted and hydrocarbon impacted sand for various electrode arrays. Vertical electrical soundings (VES) were carried out at five different locations along traverse TR3. The VES interpretation results were used to create a starting model for a 2-D SIRT iterative inversion. The inversion was carried out in order to electrically image the hydrocarbon impacted and spread out region beneath traverse TR3.Results indicate that resistivity profiles, maps and residual resistivity maps of Wenner, pole-dipole, and pole-pole and dipole-dipole pseudosections exhibit relatively high resistivities (106  1296 ohm-m) over the hydrocarbon impacted zone. Resistivity profiles and maps show the lateral spread (0.09  0.75 m) of the plume while the inverted dipole-dipole data imaged both the lateral (0.1  0.78 m) and depth extent (0.00  0.12 m) of the impact along a particular traverse (TR3).It is concluded that no single electrical survey technique provided a complete image of subsurface impact. A combination of electrical soundings, horizontal and dipole-dipole profiling proves more useful in determining the lateral and vertical extent of the contaminated sand.|Theses Collection|Laboratory/modelling of geoelectric/hydrocarbon/resistivity/sand/crude oil/wenner/pole-dipole, pole-pole and dipole-dipole arrays/pseudosections *||||||Ajewole, Emmanuel Olukayode|M|Vitamin A status and morbidity pattern in pregnant women attending the ante-natal clinic at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Wesley Guild Hospital, Ilesa||||||M.

This was based on the fact that an average of 100 new cases hooked for ante-natal care per month in the hospital. All the pregnant women registered in the clinic during the study period were recruited into the study and were each interviewed with the use of a semi-structured questionnaire to collect information on the socio-demographic characteristics of the patients as well as the current state of health and dietary habits especially in relation to vitamin A nutriture.5 ml of blood was drawn from each pregnant woman into heparinised tubes at the clinic. Retinol concentration of the plasma samples was determined by the spectrophotometric method of Neeld and Pearson (1967). Plasma retinol concentration of less than 0.35 µmol/L was regarded as deficient, 0.35 - 0.70 µmol/L as borderline while concentration greater than 0.70 µmol/L was taken as indicative of adequate vitamin A status (WHO, 1996). Data analyses were computer assisted using EPIINFO and SPSS statistical packages. Patients were classified as deficient, borderline or normal on the basis of their vitamin A status. The findings of this study revealed:(1)	Vitamin A deficiency prevalence of 17.5% among the studied pregnant women(2)	The high prevalence of vitamin A deficiency was due to inadequate consumption of vitamin A and pro-vitamin A rich foods.It was therefore recommended that the consumption of vitamin A and pro-vitamin A foods be promoted in ante-natal and infant welfare clinics.|Theses Collection|Morbidity/pregnancy/ante-natal clinic/vitamin A/dietary habits/blood sample/plasma/retinol concentration/spectrophotometric method of Neeld and Pearson1967/ infant welfare clinics/pregnant women*||||||Chijioke, Athanasius Ojiako|M|Environmental implication of household energy supply and utilization in Lagos State, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The objectives of the investigation were to supply determine types of household energy and the probable environmental consequences of different types of household energy commonly used in the state.The study was carried out using the questionnaire approach. The questionnaire was administered to 413 respondent households drawn from 6 of 20 Local government areas in Lagos State. The relevant information obtained by the questionnaire included the personal biodata of household heads, size of households, average income of household per month, educational background of household heads, type, quantity and cost of household energy commonly used, rate of change from preferred choices and reasons for the changes.Results obtained show that six types of household energy types are commonly used in Lagos State. These are fuel wood, sawdust, charcoal kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas and electricity. Biomass energy (fuel wood, sawdust and charcoal) and kerosene are the most widely used energy for cooking while electricity is the main source of energy for lighting. For instance 142 (34.4%) and 126 (30.5%) use biomass energy and kerosene respectively as primary choice of household energy for cooking while 1 383 (92.7%) use electricity for lighting. Overall, the households use 739.7kg of liquefied petroleum gas, 1260 litres of kerosene, 1880 kg of sawdust and 900kg of charcoal each month. Energy preference varied significantly from energy utilization as many households use less preferred energy. Liquefied petroleum gas and electricity were the most preferred but the least utilized option for cooking. Reasons for using less preferred energy include cost and availability of energy types, as well as educational background and income of household heads.The most important pattern of household energy mix for cooking includes fuel wood/kerosene, kerosene/electricity and liquefied petroleum gas/electricity for low-income, middle-income and high-income households respectively. Inter fuel substitution was observed among low and middle income earners only and depended on income dynamics of households and availability cum scarcity of preferred households energy. Based on the estimates of pollutant emission per meal provided by Smith et al (1999) overall energy combustion in the investigated households emited a total of 8439kg CO2. 4678kg of CO, 544.3kg of CH4, 1182.0kg of Total non-methane organic compounds, 4.3kg of NOx and 25734.2kg of Global warming commitment per month, over 95% of which were associated with kerosene and biomass energy utilization. Thus, the preponderance use of biomass and kerosene in the study area has very serious implications on the local and general environment, having the potential to pollute the air with toxic and green house gases. These adverse, effects can be mitigated by as shift to electricity and petroleum gas energy sources|Theses Collection|Household energy supply/environmental effects/fuel wood/sawdust/charcoal kerosene/Liquefied petroleum gas and electricity/pollutant/combustion/non-methane organic compounds/toxic gases*||||||Olayinka, Bolaji  Olukemi|F|Female leaders of new generation churches as change - agents in Yorubaland||||||Ph.D. Religious Studies|Chris .U.

The specific objectives of the research were to explore and critique the controversies on the question of female leadership in the New Generation Churches; discuss the role of selected female religious leaders; examine how they met the needs of their followers and their impact on the larger society. The rationale behind this study was to account for the extent to which female religious leaders had been accepted in the Nigerian society and their prospects for posterity.The study utilized the feminist hermeneutical method, which is a feminist emancipatory proclamation that asserts the authority of women to interpret the Bible for themselves. It interprets biblical texts in the light of oppressive structures of patriarchal societies. This method was supplemented with questionnaires, interviews and participant-observation in six churches purposively selected. Four categories of female leadership in the New Generation Churches were examined: women church founders, women overseers/pastors, pastors' wives and women who are leaders of the female forum of their churches. Particularly, responses were sought regarding their backgrounds, religious activities and their role as change-agents. In addition, questionnaires were issued out to lay male and female and ordained male ministers in the selected churches in order to determine the impact of female religious leaders with respect to enhancing women leadership in the Church and the society.The findings indicated that female religious leaders were encouraging new positive attitudes as regards the role and effectiveness of women in the Church, among their congregations and in the larger society. This has led to the promotion of gender tolerance, respect and mutual understanding among the sexes especially in the New Generation Churches. Empowering others and stressing accountability in all manner of conduct were two major strategies employed by the female religious leaders in popularising their denominations. However, these female religious leaders were yet to formulate a definitive theological stance on the ministry of women in the Church. Besides, none of the female religious leaders examined in this study claimed identification with feminism. They professed opposition to advocating a confrontational attitude towards men in advancing gender equality. They also disdained the advocacy for sexual freedom and abortion.The thesis concluded that female religious leaders of the New Generation Churches in Yorubaland had made a significant impact on their followers and the larger Yoruba society with respect to the promotion of female leadership in the Church. There was also substantial evidence to support the view that female religious leadership especially in the New Generation Churches had come to stay.|Theses Collection|New Generation Churches/female leadership/female religious leaders/patriarchal societies/women overseers/pastors/gender*||||||Adedeji, Olubukola|F|Characterization and evaluation of collections of Panicum Maximum JACQ in south- western, Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Botany|J.O.

Thirty-five accessions were collected and transplanted into the Biological Garden of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. These accessions were subjected to morphological, agrobotanical, foliar epidermal, reproductive biology, meiotic, karyotypic, forage and nutritive value studies.The accessions were characterized using botanical and agrobotanical parameters, chromosome studies were carried out using the squash technique. Forage and nutritive value studies were carried out according to standard procedures. Data were analysed using standard statistical procedures (ANOVA, Cluster Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, Simple descriptive statistics and graphs).Two field forms were collected and planted: the heavy-tillering, robust, tall, long and broad-leafed with relatively fat culm and the low-tillering, not so robust, moderately tall, not so long and narrow-leafed with thin culms. By the first rainy season after planting, it was observed that the second type had reverted to the first type.All accessions studied have chromosome number 2n = 32, including the accessions from the Oil Palm Plantation at Apoje, Ijebu-lgbo in Ogun State, for which a chromosome number of 2n = 28 had previously been reported. Meiotic irregularities of quadrivalents and univalents occurred with high frequency. This accounted for the low pollen fertility and very low seed set. A mean of about 13 bivalents per cell with regular occurrence of 1- 5 quadrivalents per cell suggest that P. maximum is a segmental allopolyploid. Metaphase chromosome characters were used to assign the karyotypic formula 1 Csm+ 15Bsm for P. maximum.Forage yield studies revealed that number of tillers per plant stand and dry matter yields of culm, leafy portion and above ground plant are the parameters involved in the determination of forage yield. The nutritive value studies showed that crude protein, Potassium, Nitrogen, Sodium and Calcium concentrations are within the recommended range for animal feed. Based on forage attributes and nutritive value, genetic entities were recognized. This suggests that there are genetic resources in the populations of Panicum maximum surveyed.This study has further revealed that P. maximum in South-western Nigeria are poor seeders, their propagation is through root-stocks and roots from the nodes, the panicles are sinks, and there is an inverse relationship between herbage quality and herbage yield. On the basis of these, it is recommended that harvesting or grazing on P. maximum field should be done at 15 days or maximum of 30 days interval during the rainy season, that is, before the plants flower.|Theses Collection|Panicum maximum Jacq/Morphology/agrobotanical/foliar epidermal/reproductive biology/meiotic/karyotypic/forage and nutritive value studies/ Oil Palm Plantation/NPK /panicles/herbage quality/herbage yield*||||||Awe, Oluwatoyin Abimbola|F|A study of In Vivo antibacterial activity of Alchornea Cordifolia Muelli.

Arg. is a shrub which is common in the forest all over West Africa. The reported antibacterial activity of the extract of the leaves of this plant as well as its extensive use in traditional medical practice for the treatment of various infectious diseases suggest that this plant has the potential of becoming a very useful anti-infective agent for the treatment of systemic infections including those caused by organisms which have acquired resistance to antibiotics. For this to be possible, however, there is need to provide evidence for the in vivo anti-infective activity as well as the safety of this plant.A. cordifolia leaves were collected within the Obafemi Awolowo University campus, dried and extracted with 50% aqueous ethanol. The ethanolic extract was screened for its level of toxicity in mice (weight: 18-24g; 5 mice per group) by administering different doses of the extract to the mice subcutaneously and the LD50 of the extract was determined graphically. The effect of the administration of different doses (5-125mg/kg body weight) of the extract on the survival time of mice which had been infected intraperitoneally with a lethal dose (2.0 x109 cfu) of multiply resistant nasal Staphylococcus aureus was studied. Appropriate control experiments were also carried out.Statistical analysis of data showed that the subcutaneous median lethal dose of the extract was 177.83mg/kg body weight of the mice and a dose-dependent in vivo antibacterial activity was demonstrated with the survival time of bacteraemic mice improved by doses in the range 25-125mg/kg. A dose of 125mg/kg body weight provided a significant prolongation of survival time of infected mice when compared with untreated infected control animals (p> 0.05).This study shows that A. cordifolia leaf extract indeed possesses antibacterial activity against multiply resistant S. aureus in vivo and. also indicates that A. cordifolia has the potential of being acutely toxic if taken in sufficiently high doses.From this study, the widespread use of this plant as an anti-infective agent in many parts of West Africa, therefore, has some justification. |Theses Collection|Alchornea cordifolia/shrub/antibacterial/traditional medical practice/antibiotics/aqueous ethanol/toxicity/Staphylococcus aureus/A. cordifolia leaf/ *||||||Dosunmu, Shamsideen  Adegboyega|M|Performance appraisal system and leadership succession planning in Lever Brothers Nigeria PLC and O'DUA  Investment Company Ltd [1980 -2000] ||||||Ph.D. Public Administration|S.B.

The study was comparative; viewing the two organisations from the public and private sector, perspectives.Primary and Secondary methods of data collection were employed for the study. Primary data were collected through questionnaires and interviews, while secondary data were extracted from published and unpublished materials in the libraries of Obafemi Awolowo University, University of Ibadan and University of Lagos. Publications from professional associations like Institute of Personnel Management of Nigeria (IPM), Centre for Management Development (CMD) and Nigerian Institute of Training and Development (NITAD) were also consulted. Annual Reports and Newsletters published by, and those subscribed to by Lever Brothers Limited and O'dua Investment Company Limited were also utilized.The research found that there exists a relationship between performance appraisal and leadership succession planning in the two Organisations, although the degree of the relationship tended to vary. The relationship was found to be stronger in the case of Lever Brothers, than in O'dua Investment Company Limited. Various (actors ranging from ownership structure, organizational style, culture and orientation and the quality of staff were found to be responsible for the variation. The study also revealed that the performance of workers in the two organisations was influenced by other intervening factors; key among which was the level of motivation in the organisations. Both organisations had good incentive structures that motivated their workers to perform well. Good performance therefore increased the pool of potential succession candidates available within the organisations. This therefore, brought out clearly the fact that motivation also plays an important role in determining the performance of individual workers in the organisations. The study concluded that a succession planning system that relies extensively on the performance appraisal outcome is much more effective than the approach employed by most public and private organisations in Nigeria which combine merit, federal character and politics in determining those who are likely to be the successors.|Theses Collection|Performance appraisal/leadership succession planning/Lever Brothers Nigeria Plc/O'dua Investment Company Limited/Institute of Personnel Management of Nigeria (IPM)/Centre for Management Development (CMD)/Nigerian Institute of Training and Development (NITAD)*||||||Oladoyin, Anthony  Mayowa|M|Indigenous Governance and the management of  conflict and stability in the multi-ethnic community of Ilorin||||||Ph.D. Public Administration|S.B.

It also examined and discussed the roles of indigenous institutions in the management of conflict in Ilorin. The study then attempted to draw constructive lessons from the Ilorin experience for enhancing good governance and conflict management in Nigeria.Both primary and secondary sources of data were utilized for the study. The primary data generated from interviews, participant observation and focus group discussion (FGD) were triangulated and subjected to non-parametric statistical and descriptive analyses.Secondary data from archival sources, official documents, scholarly texts, published articles as well as unpublished works were used to complement the primary data.The study discovered that although conflict is inalienable of human interactions, it could still be effectively kept under check through a legitimate and responsive political institution. It was then discovered that the legitimacy of indigenous institutions that have facilitated good governance and effective conflict management in Ilorin are rooted in historical traditions as well as in Islamic religion. It was further discovered that the low level of political awareness in Ilorin, emanating from mass illiteracy among the people of Ilorin has tended to strengthen the aforementioned historical traditions and other indigenous values.Another major finding was that ethnic plurality of Ilorin has not adversely affected the stability of the community, but most of the cases of instability and conflicts were influenced by religious factors.The study however noted that the enabling environmental-cum institutional factors that enhance solidarity, cooperation and regime longevity at the indigenous society level should be identified and constructively harnessed for effective modern governance.The study concluded on the note that some constructive lessons regarding how indigenous approach facilitates good governance and effective conflict management in Ilorin should be synthesized and applied to State-based institutions in the country at large.|Theses Collection|Indigenous governance/community affairs/management of conflict/governance/political institution/legitimacy of indigenous institutions/illiteracy/historical traditions/environment*||||||Effiong, Ubong Titus|M|Analytical study of chloroquine preparations||||||M.Sc.

The methods of analysis employed were titrimetry and UV spectrophotometry. Identification tests were also carried out using thin layer chromatography in addition to other chemical tests to ascertain the presence of chloroquine in the products. Weight uniformity tests were conducted on the solid preparations of the drug.The results showed that two of the tablets and capsules analysed did not meet the requirements for the content of chloroquine as specified in the B.P. The values obtained for the UV spectrophotometric method for the two samples (C5 and 132) were 16.0 % and 67.56 % respectively. For the volumetric method, the values were 16.6 % for C5 and 68.81 % for B2. The B.P specifies that chloroquine tablets and capsules contain 92.5  107.5 % of chloroquine. Two of the syrup samples S7 and S12, also failed to meet the requirements with percentage content of chloroquine of 37.02 %, and 81.29 % respectively.It can be concluded that, those preparations that failed to comply with specifications in the official compendia are substandard and hence their use in malaria chemotherapy may lead to therapeutic failure. Sub-therapeutic levels of chloroquine in the body from administration of such substandard preparations may result in further propagation of chloroquine resistance in malaria chemotherapy.|Theses Collection|Chloroquine/chloroquine preparations/capsules/syrup/antimalaria drug/titrimetry/UV spectrophotometry/chromatography/chemotherapy/sub-therapeutic levels *||||||Akomolede, Timothy Ifedayo|M|Legal analysis of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) as an antidote to the delay in the dispensation of justice in Nigeria||||||M.

The cumulative distribution function (c.d.f) of the GGd is not in closed form; and to bring it to users' reach an approximation that requires the use of the t-distribution table is proposed. The errors of this approximation are found to be practically small (within 10-4)Few characterizations of the GGD are given to show its relationship with the Erlang distribution. A necessary and sufficient condition for a random variable to be generalized Gumbel is given. The exact distribution of the sum of independent random variable from the GGd was obtained. The moments estimate, proposed for the scale and location parameters are generalized. This made it possible to find moment estimators of the parameters easily.Finally, the applications of the GGd were considered in analyzing Flood and Earthquake data. Return periods were predicted and the maximum shallow shocks were estimated for maximum shallow shocks (M> 6.0) in Tohoku area, Japan between 1885 and 1980. When applied to hydrological data collected on annual maximum flood on Cypress Creek, near Houston, Texas between 1945 and 1975, these results gave closer estimates to the observed frequencies especially as regard largest maximum and smallest minimum, which are of practical importance in Hydrology and Flood plain analysis.|Theses Collection|Generalized Gumbel distribution/cumulative distribution function/Erlang distribution/independent random variable/analyzing Flood and Earthquake data/return periods/shallow shocks/hydrological data/flood plain analysis*||||||Agboola, Ayodeji Akinlolu|M|Impact of computer automation on banking services in Lagos||||||M.Phil.

Three banks were chosen from the old generation banks and three from the new generation banks. Questionnaires were administered to bank employees and customers and this was backed up with interviews. Two separate sets of questionnaires were prepared for the staff. The first set was administered only to the heads of the System Unit to determine the extent to which each bank had implemented some identified devices, how long it had been using them, and their spread into branches. The second set was designed for the staff in the System Unit to determine the factors prompting the establishment to embark on banking automation. Questionnaires were also designed for the customers to elicit information on their satisfaction or lack of satisfaction with the services rendered by their banks. Administration of questionnaires to the customers was based on grab sampling.Data collected were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics such as percentages, mean, standard deviation and variance.The study revealed that the six banks had computer system with local and wide area networking. All of them also claimed to have electronic data transfer and electronic data interchange except Zenith Bank. None of the new generation banks had automated teller machines and only two of them had telephone banking. Point of sales system and electronic home and office banking are not yet popular in Nigeria as only one bank claimed to have these facilities. Electronic home and office banking has also not made a serious impact on the banking system due to lack of facilities necessary for its operation.About 76% of the respondents agreed that the need for faster services highly influenced banks' decision to embark on automation. The calculated mean of 4.74 on a 5-point likert scale supported this view. Similarly, the need for improved customer services, ease of funds transfer, cheque processing, modernization and building competitive strength equally influenced banks' decision to go on automation. About 67% of the respondents were of the opinion that automation had altered the required skills in the banking industry and 95% believed in the need to train workers to make them relevant to an automated banking environment. Eighty-eight percent of the respondents disagreed with the view that automated machines have complicated work in the banks.The study concluded that investment in information technology had become an important component in the overall strategy of banking operations to ensure competitive strength in the industry.

The primary aims of the study are the calcareous nannofossil and foraminiferal biostratigraphic, paleoenvironmental deductions and sequence stratigraphic analysis of the 1866-3465 metre and 1501-2208 metre depth intervals of Aroh-2 and Dibi-6 wells respectively. The study is envisaged to give an insight into the calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy of the Niger delta, supported by foraminifera and the petroleum bearing potentials of the wells.The ditch-cutting samples provided for this study were processed using standard micropaleontological procedures. The forms recovered were identified and used for subsequent interpretations. On the bases of quantitative and qualitative interpretations of the data, one calcareous nannofossil zone-Discoaster sublodoensis (NP 14) zone, along with two informal benthic zones of Eponides eshira and Florilus atlanticus, were proposed for Aroh-2 well, while one planktic foraminiferal zone-Globigerina ciperoensis ciperoensis (P22) zone, along with two informal benthic zones of Uvigerina subperegrina and an Indeterminate zone are proposed for Dibi-6 well. A Middle Eocene age has been assigned the studied interval of Aroh-2 well, while a Late Oligocene to Early Miocene age was assigned to Dibi-6 well, based on the recovered calcareous nannofossil and foraminiferal assemblages. A littoral to inner neritic environment of deposition has been inferred for both wells based largely on the presence of environmentally restricted benthic foraminiferal species.Minor Maximum Flooding Surfaces derived from peak foraminiferal and calcareous nannofossil abundances and diversities integrated with wireline-log signatures, enabled the subdivisions of the well sections into sequences and systems tracts.The implications of these are that the identified Lowstand Systems Tract and Highstand Systems Tract (which could serve as reservoir) and sealed extensive shale bodies (which could act as a seal) occur in the strata. Their presence in the sequence enhances the hydrocarbon prospects of the studied intervals of both wells.|Theses Collection|Biostratigraphic/paleoecologic/calcareous nannofossil/foraminifera/micropaleontological/Aroh-2 and Dibi - 6 wells/wireline-log signature/Lowstand Systems Tract/Highstand Systems Tract/Eocene/  *||||||Ajanaku, Ayodele Jolaoso|M|A study of synthetic seismogram interpretation of star well oil field , Niger Delta||||||M.Sc.

This program was coded into an efficient, computer program for generating synthetic seismograms used for interpreting the seismic sections from the oil field.From analysis of the borehole logs, the lithologic sequence contains eight sand, five shale and three shaly-sand bodies. The pay zone extends from 1.50 s to 1.59 s seismic two-way travel time. Obtained reflection coefficients at the boundaries of the above sand-shale reservoir sequence range between 0.00112143 and 0.00910572. The corresponding transmission loss factors were 0.00220722 and 0.00667207.The result of the computational analysis of the synthetic seismogram showed that source wavelets can he modelled successfully using the Ricker pulse of central frequency of 30Hz and bandwidths of 51, 71 and 81 ms respectively.It is concluded that, synthetic seismograms characterised by these forgoing parameters (center frequency of 30 Hz and bandwidths of 51. 71 and 81 ms) correlate with seismic events and thus delineate the subsurface geologic structures associated with hydrocarbon accumulation.|Theses Collection|Seismogram/geophysical logs/hydrocarbon/lithologic sequence/wavelets/Ricker pulse of central frequency/bandwidth/subsurface geologic structures *||||||Udoaka, Edem Essien|M|A critical apprasal of the international patent system and the developing countries||||||M.Phil Law|Ademola O.

Data were also gathered from learned journals, textbooks, law reports, bulletins, patent conventions, treaties and other relevant laws.A review of these showed that the International Patent System encourages research, inventions, technological and economic development through dissemination of technical information and motivation of inventors and investors with the grant of temporary monopoly for the control of the exploitation of their inventions.The study however revealed that the principles of the international patent system were established by the industrialized countries at a time when most of the present developing countries were not independent, and did not participate in the formulation. These principles have therefore not operated in favour of the latter. Such include the principle of national treatment which stipulates quality treatment for nationals of all member countries irrespective of their technological background, seeing that ability to benefit depends on the degree of technological development.The study also revealed that the recently introduced TRIPS Agreement has not only confirmed all the obnoxious principles of the Paris Convention, but has introduced some more stringent ones. These include restricting the grounds and hardening the conditions for the grant of compulsory licenses, and making patent rights available and enjoyable for any inventions, whether product or process, in all fields of technology, without discrimination as to the place of invention, the field of technology, and whether the products are imported or locally manufactured. These have greatly hindered the developing countries, particularly in the area of transfer of technology through exploitation of patented inventions locally. Besides, as the World Trade Organisation Agreement (1994) has made intellectual property protection compulsory for all its member states, developing countries are precluded from exercising any discretion to their own benefits.What is more, the developing countries lack adequate indigenous technological manpower and capacities, research funds, facilities, machinery for control of exorbitant prices of patented products and adequate knowledge of the system, all of which undermine their ability to utilize its benefits. They have also not given incentives to local and foreign patentees to work with inventions locally. Though, the World Intellectual Property Organisation has been assisting the developing countries in various ways to cope with and benefit more from the system, these have so far yielded little results because of the above hinderances.The study concluded that what the developing countries need is a system of patent protection which takes cognizance of their present level of technological development, and which is not wholly reflective of the interest of  the developed countries only.|Theses Collection|Developing countries/International Patent System/transfer of technology/intellectual property administration/World Intellectual Property Organisation/TRIPS Agreement/ Paris Convention/World Trade Organisation Agreement (1994)/ *||||||Hotton, Joseph Anthony|M|Some ecological impact of flooding on agricultural communities in the Benue trough, Adamawa State||||||M.Sc.

The study was carried out in all the three Agricultural Development Programme (ADP) zones Osun State. Structured interview schedule was used to elicit information from one hundred and eight farmers on the adoption of soybean production package. The selection of the blocks within the zones was based on farmers' involvement in arable crop production. Descriptive statistics such as frequency counts, percentages, means, standard deviation were used to analyse data collected  while inferential statistics such as chi-square(x2),contingency-co-efficient(c), correlation co-efficient (r), co-efficient of determination (r2), and regression analysis were used to test the hypotheses.The results showed that about 68 percent adopted soybean production package. The reasons for adoption included financial capability (68%), contact with village Extension Agents (63%). Also 50 percent of the respondents claimed that being members of social organizations made them to adopt, close relationship with contact Partners was the reason given by 41 percent of' the respondents. Other adopters about 38 percent were opportuned to procure labour. Some adopters (16%) have land which made it easier for them to adopt and availability of planting materials. chemicals and other inputs were the reasons why 14 percent of the respondents adopted the package. Problems associated with adoption of soybean production package were inadequate credit/capital to farmers, irregular visits by the extension agents, non-availability of improved seeds and other inputs, poor weather condition, poor soil condition, problems connected with harvesting, processing and marketing problems. The Agricultural inputs and service units in Osun State were often used as source of inputs and major source of capital to farmers were their personal savings. Extension agents and mass media like radio and television were the major sources of information.The only significant relationships were found between adoption of soybean production package and farm size, membership of social organization, level of education and age of respondents (p > 0.05).Significant and positive correlation was observed between some selected characteristics of soybean production package: relative advantage (r=0.624), complexity (r=0.325), cost (r=0.672), availability (r=0.543), acceptability (r=0.446) and level of adoption (P>0.05). Also there was significant but negative correlation between compatibility (r= -0.418) and adoption of soybean package at 0.05 level of significance. There was positive and significant relationship between sources of credit and adoption of soybean production package when r = 0.4325 (P> 0.05).In conclusion, farmers formed the largest category of people who lived in the study area although they had other secondary occupations.

The effects of core excitations were explicitly incorporated for different deformation parameters and different effective interactions.Core excitation was achieved by projecting states with good angular momentum from the excitation of two P1/2 protons from the k = ±1/2 Nilsson orbit for different deformation parameters. The configuration basis was thus a mixture of shell model basis states and 4p-2h core-excited collective states. A special variational approach was utilized to produce the best border line matrices and the corresponding wave functions for each positive parity angular momentum state considered.Energy levels, single-nucleon transfer spectroscopic factors, two-nucleon transfer amplitudes and some electromagnetic transition rates were calculated using the modified shell model formalism for each deformation parameter and effective interaction.The existence of predominantly collective structures for the 0+2, 2+3 and 4+2 levels at 3.6345, 5.260, and 7.117Mev respectively was confirmed. The halflives of the 2+1, 0+2 and 4+1 levels were successfully reproduced. Also good agreement with data on transfer reactions was obtained.The good agreement of the predicted values of the various quantities calculated using this formalism with the relevant experimental results strongly favour the description of the low-lying positive parity states in 180 nucleus as mixtures of (sd)2 shell model configurations and low-lying 4p-2h states that are predominantly (ìp)-2v(sd)2 in character.|Theses Collection|Shell model configurations/18O nucleus/core excitations/angular momentum/border line matrices/wave functions/single-nucleon transfer spectroscopic factors/halflives/low-lying positive parity *||||||Benson, Kunle Sheinde|M|Training and manpower development at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife||||||M.Sc.

It also assessed the effects of delays on completion cost and time of building projects. Two methods of data collection were employed. The first involved the use of multiple-choice questionnaires. Two hundred (200) questionnaires were distributed. Ninety (90) were administered on Quantity surveyors out of which 46 were returned, fifty (50) and sixty (60) questionnaires were administered on designers and contractors respectively. The designers returned twenty-one while 35 were returned by the contractors. Secondary data were also collected in respect of 61 completed building projects in order to assess the effects of delays on completion cost and time of building projects of different sizes and magnitudes. The projects ranged between 0.179 million naira and 231 million naira.The data analysis was carried out using average, relative importance indices while statistical methods of linear and multiple regression analyses were employed for the quantifiable cost and time data.The findings showed that clients and contractors were the main causes of delays. Clients' cash flow problem and request for changes in design when construction is underway were the main sources of client-related delays. Contractors' financial difficulty was found to be the most important cause of contractor-related delay. The findings also showed that cost and time overruns were the most frequent effects of delay with inflationary increase in material cost during delay being the main cause of cost overrun. The results further revealed that loss and expense claim arising from delay, fluctuation claim during delay period and elongation period of project had significant effects on completion cost and: time of projects of different sizes and magnitudes. The study concluded that time and cost overruns on building projects could be carefully controlled by reducing the influences of delay factors. In order to reduce the occurrence of delay and its impact on completion time effective project monitoring from commencement to completion of project is necessary. Material stockpiling at the outset of project implementation would assuage the incidence of inflationary increase of material cost during delay period and its effect on completion cost.|Theses Collection|Quantity surveyors/completion cost/designers/contractors/clients' cash flow/inflation/fluctuation claim/delay period/material stockpiling    *||||||Adebiyi, Festus Mayowa|M|Physico-chemical characteristics of tar sand fractions from south-west, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The tar sands samples were obtained from two different locations (Agbabu and Olowo-Irele), the former is a deep bore hole and latter an out crop. The bitumen and water contents were extracted using Soxhlet extractor and Dean and Stark apparatus respectively. The bitumen was deasphaltened using n-pentane. The raffinate (maltene) was eluted with n-pentane in a glass tube chromotographic column 1.00m long and 0.004m internal diameter which was filled with activated alumina to remove the oil. For complete elusion, the remaining resin on the column was progressively eluted with tetrachloromethane, toluene, trichloromethane and ethanol-solvents of increasing polarity.The trace metal contents were determined using the Buck Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer model 200A. The identification of the functional groups of organic compounds present were determined using Infra Red Spectrophotometer previously calibrated with polysterene. The physical characteristics (API gravity, refractive index, viscosity, surface tension and freezing point) of the oil fraction eluted from the bitumen contents were determined using Association of Official Analytical Chemist (AOAC).The water contents of Agbabu and Olowo-Irele sample were 15.14± 0.03% and 33.48± 0.05% w/w, whilst the bitumen fraction of Agbabu sample was found to be 83.40% while that of Olowo-Irele was 45.70% w/w. The bitumen content of Agbabu sample which was higher than Olowo-Irele sample might be due to the fact that Agbabu sample was collected directly from a deep bore hole while Olowo-Irele was an out crop which has already been exposed to weathering and/or mixed with more mineral matter. The Zn contents in the oil, asphaltene, and resin fractions were (102.60-187.40ppm) and the Ni contents in the fractions were (11.00-39.00 ppm) whilst the V contents were (2.52-16.60ppm).

It is the first known work on the zooplankton fauna of the effluent and the effluent receiving stream. A major objective of the study was to assess the efficiency of the oxidation ponds (which were established about three decades ago and were not disludged regularly) and zooplankton indicator species associated with the effluent stream.Fourteen sampling sites were chosen to represent the eight habitats covered. The habitats included the unimpacted section of the receiving stream, the impacted section of the receiving stream, influent wastewater, ponds effluent discharge, unimpacted section of Opa River and impacted section of Opa River. The physico-chemical parameters of the samples investigated were: oxygen parameters (dissolved oxygen, percent oxygen saturation and biochemical oxygen demand), major cations (calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium), major anions (chloride, sulphate and total alkalinity), nutrients (phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, silicate and organic matter), physical parameters, (temperature, turbidity, solids and flow discharge) as well as pH and conductivity. Samples were collected from each sampling site fortnightly and altogether 140 water/effluent/influent samples were collected over the six month period. All field determinations and laboratory analyses carried out were according to standard methods. The recorded plankton was measured, counted, drawn and identified using standard reference tests and keys on the zooplankton of Nigerian waters. The relationship between investigated sites with regard to their physico-chemical properties and zooplankton fauna were analysed using various statistical tests including descriptive statistics, linear regression analysis, correlation analysis, cluster analysis and factor analysis. The zooplanton fauna comprised 67 species made up of 54 species of ritifers, 11 copepods and 2 claocerans. Three gross pollution indicator species (Rotaria sp. and Moina  micrura) were found in the impacted section of the effluent receiving stream.Seven parameters (turbidity, conductivity, alkalinity, sulphate, oxygen saturation, BOD and phosphate) had efficiency greater than 50% in the rainy season while dry season recorded efficiency greater than 50% in 14 parameters (turbidity, TS, conductivity, Ca. Na, K, total alkalinity, Cl, SO4, DO, oxygen saturation, BOD, NH3 and PO4). High values of correlation coefficient (p < 0.05) occurred between the occurrence of zooplankton and BOD, TSS, Ca, Mg, Si02, pH and turbidity.The t-test analyses between the impacted and unimpacted sections of both the effluents receiving stream and Opa River showed no significant difference (P > 0.05).Based on the zooplankton occurrence and physico-chemical parameters of the receiving water bodies, it is shown that the waterbodies were not grossly polluted after effluent outfall from the oxidation ponds. This is as a result of the low discharge volume of the ponds effluent compared to the receiving stream and Opa River respectively|Theses Collection|Sewage/ponds/zooplankton fauna/oxidation/habitats/influent wastewater/cations/anions/nutrients/turbidity/conductivity/alkalinity/oxygen saturation *||||||Omisola, Beatrice Oluyomi|F|Purification and partial characterisation of glycogen phosphorylase from the skeletal muscle of kinixys erosa||||||M.Sc.

The enzyme occurs in two intercovertible forms, phosphorylase a, the more active form and phosphorylase b, the less active form. This study is aimed at investigating the properties of glycogen phosphorylase in the African land Tortoise, Kinixys erosa and is expected to provide insight into its physiological role (s) in this slow animal compared to it's function in the actively exercising and well studied terrestrial animals.The enzyme from the skeletal muscle of Kinixys erosa was purified to homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography on a Sephadex A.25 column, followed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-200 column. Apparent Michaelis Menten constants Km of the enzymes for glycogen, glucose 1-phosphate and Amp were 1.78%, 50mM and 0.18mM respectively. The apparent molecular weight estimated by gel filtration on a sephadex G-200 column was 200,000 ± 20,000 daltons while the Subunit molecular weight estimated by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrimide gel electrophoresis was found to be 104,000 daltons. The optimum pH for enzymatic activity was found to be 6.8. NaCl and NaF were found to inhibit the enzyme while Na2SO4 enhanced the activity of the enzyme. Glucose was also inhibitory to the enzyme.The overall result indicates that the tortoise glycogen phosphorylase has a specific activity much lower than the enzyme from other sources. It is however similar to them in terms of kinetic and physico-chemical properties.|Theses Collection|Glycogen phosphorylase/catalysis/glucose 1-phosphate/Kinixys erosa/ Sephadex G-200 column/enzyme/Michaelis Menten constants/gel filtration*||||||Adisa, Banji  Olalere|M|Participation of community based organisations in rural development projects in Osun State of Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Agricultural Extension & Rural  Sociology|A.A.

The study was conducted in six purposefully selected rural local government areas in Osun State, Nigeria. Data were collected from fifty six (56) organisations randomly selected and one hundred and fifty six (156) individual members of the organisations. Structured interview schedule duly pretested and validated was used for data collection. Frequency counts, percentage, mean, ranking and standard deviation were used to describe the data, while chi-square (X2) contingency co-efficient (c) correlation and regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses formulated. Factor and components analyses were used to isolate unique and crucial factors with participation.The results showed that community development associations, various types of cooperative societies and village/town improvement unions were the most predominant organisations. Maintaining members interest, educating and motivating people for self-help projects and inculcating the spirit of self-reliance were the most frequently performed roles by the organisations. The results also show that seven characteristics of organisation namely: years of establishment of organisation (r = 0.447), membership strength (r = 0.360), criteria for selecting members (r = 0.591), revenue/available and used (r = 0.281), pervasiveness (r = 0.267), socialization process (r = 0.591) and orientation (r = 0.586) were positive and significantly associated with group participation. Only three community characteristics namely: population (r = 0.627), number of ethnic groups (r = 0.747) and infrastructural facilities (r = 0.647) were positively and significantly associated with group participation. Positive and significant relationships were found at 0.05 level of significance between individual participation in self-help projects and demographic characteristics such as age (r = 0.300), religious affiliation (r = 0.194), level of education (r = 0. 510), occupation (r = 0.990), economic status (r = 0.226), social status (r = 0.224), membership of social organisations (r = 0.362) and attitude to participation (r = 0.491). The higher these variables, the greater the benefits derivable by the respondents from participation.Regression results showed that organisation orientation (b = 4.705), revenue available and used (b = 3.115), membership strength (b = 2.663), decision-making process (b = 2.551), pervasiveness (b = 1.389) in the case of groups; and membership of social organisation (b = 2.378), sex (b = 2.064) and social status (b = 0.897) in the case of individuals, were the determinants of their participation in self-help 'projects. Five groups of factors isolated in association with organisation participations were: organisation bureaucracy (X = 1.364), income generation and utilization (X = 1.523), tension management (X = 1.312), cohesiveness (X = 1.0430), and decision making process (X = 1.031). Principal components/factors identified in association with individual participation in self-help projects were household characteristics (X = 2.921), occupation (X = 2.164). socio-economic factor (X = 1.346), minor social factor (X = 1.137) and group influence (X = 1.041). Low capital accumulation and inadequate financial resources, inadequate estimation of available resources as well as inadequate and ineffective coordination and supervision of organisations and their projects were the major constraints to effective and efficient performance of the organisations in the study area.

The degree of acceptance of such patients among nurses in Osun State was also examined and furthermore, the study sought to identify factors influencing nurses' level of knowledge, skills and attitudes towards caring for PLWHA.The study was conducted among 472 nurses, who were selected, using Multistage sampling technique, from the federal, state and local government health institutions in Osun State. The instrument used in this study was a 51 - item questionnaire adapted from the instrument developed by Pringle et. al (1988). Descriptive statistics such as percentages and frequencies as well as inferential statistics were used in analyzing data collected.The findings reflected that the majority (80.3%) of nurses in the sample, most especially in the teaching hospitals were knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS and were skilful in caring for PLWHA. However, knowledge deficit was recorded on the pathophysiology of affected target organ by AIDS virus, available diagnostic tests, inactivation agents and drugs used for treating PLWHA. The majority (60%) felt that there was a need to update their knowledge and skills in the care of patients with HIV/AIDS through public lectures. It was found that there was a statistically significant relationship between nurses' level of 'accurate knowledge and skills' about caring for PLWHA and the setting of care where they are employed as well as socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents. The majority of the nurses studied expressed serious concerns about the risk they may create for members of their families, non-availability of nurse experts' in care of PLWHA to assist in updating their practice and contracting HIV/AIDS through accidentally pricking themselves with contaminated needle or splashing infected material into their eyes while caring for PLWHA. The majority of the nurses in the study were willing to care for PLWHA except where dealing with body fluid (blood, urine and sputum) is involved. The findings revealed a more positive attitude towards caring for PLWHA among the nurses studied.In conclusion, there is need for professional training and development programmes not only to remove barriers for providing appropriate care and treatment but also to update nurses' knowledge and skills about caring for PLWHA and to ensure their safety in practice.|Theses Collection|HIV/AIDS/health institutions/Nurses' knowledge/pathophysiology/AIDS virus/HIV/AIDS  patients/body fluid    *||||||Ayangade, Jonathan  Ademola|M|An evaluation of safety practices in selected construction sites in Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

This was backed up with oral interviews and personal observation to work procedures. Archival data was used to obtain the effect of safety programme implementation on accident cases. Univariate and Bivariate statistical techniques were adopted for the analysis. This included a frequency distribution of relevant variables, correlation and regression analyses in order to determine the extent of their relationship.This study identified key elements that were expected to feature in a workable safety programme, prominent among which was the establishment of safety objectives and strong management commitment towards safety and well designed safety policy. The study however revealed in inadequate provision of resources for ensuring safety thereby leading to inadequate sustenance of workable safety programme. Even though most respondents (66.3%) claimed that they had a written safety programme, only 1.1% of the respondents was able to provide a copy of their safety programme. The result showed that the management considered the workers' ability to take instruction when selecting its workforce. However, they did not have strong commitments to safety since workers with had assessment records were not dismissed neither were they promoted as a result of good assessment record.  The effect of safety programme implementation was considered among four major tradesmen - bricklayers, carpenters, labourers and iron benders in residential. Commercial, industrial and institutional building construction sites. There was a great reduction in the number of accident cases. For the residential buildings, the reductions were 31.88%, 15.18%, 19.05% and 20.85% for bricklayers, carpenters, labourers and iron benders respectively. In this same order, the reductions for commercial buildings were 29.15%, 53.39%, 50.34% and 82.65% respectively. Those for industrial buildings were 69.02%, 02.22%,4 6.74% and 59.30% respectively. While those for institutional buildings were 56.22%, 47.84%, 58.26% and 43.13% respectivey.

It is in realisation of this fact that the government, since the late eighties initiated a wide range of reforms directed at promoting efficiency in the sector.These reforms yielded positive results at the initial period but this was short  lived as many banks became distressed year after year and resolution rather than preventive strategies were embarked upon. The measure applied did not appear to have been based on any objective study oldie causes of the problem.There have been instances where inaccurate and window-dressed returns are sent by the management of banks to the regulatory authorities with little or no effort on the part oldie regulatory authorities to cross -- check facts and figures as a way of recognizing early warning signals of banking distress.It is against this background that this study was conceived. The research study however moved a step forward from previous studies which revolved around causes of bank distress and probable solutions, to evaluate the performance of regulatory institutions in the management of distress in the banking sector.A survey instrument (questionnaire) was used for data collection, and analysis was based on percentages and frequency distributions. Chi- square statistical test was further employed to confirm the results of finding. It was revealed that a list of internal and external factors is responsible for the endemic distress in the banking sector. The study however revealed that file regulatory institutions have not been effective and efficient in the supervision of the banking sector.The objective of the study centred on the evaluation of the performance of the regulatory institutions in the prevention and management of distress in Nigerian banking sector. The population of study includes middle and management staff of all the regulatory institutions, commercial and merchant banks in Lagos and Abuja. The researcher employed a purposive sampling procedure to select the first two hundred and fifty respondents of the research study from the existing eight regulatory institutions. Thirty respondents each were chosen from seven regulatory institutions and forty from central bank of Nigeria because of the strategic nature of the apex bank to the research work. Also, ten respondents each were chosen randomly from twenty- five commercial and merchant banks out of the existing one hundred and eight licensed as at the time of carrying out this research work. The research instrument was subjected to a test of validity and reliability through a pilot test and the data analysis was based on simple frequency-distribution analysis and chi-square statistical test. The research demonstrated that the causes of distress in Nigeria banking sector are both endogenous and exogenous to the system. The endogenous factors include bad management, board squabble, fraud, unsecured loan, connected lending, manipulated auditors reports etc. The findings also revealed that the exogenous factors such as weak Supervisory machinery, weak sanctions for contravening regulatory laws and lack of serious interest on the part of the regulatory institutions in promoting depositors' fund also contributed to a large extent to the distress in the banking sector. In conclusion therefore the argument as to who is responsible for what, in the cause and management of bank distress should remain a mirror on how to tackle the problem. The research work has demonstrated enough that regular and effective supervision remain the most potent antidote against widespread deterioration in the operating condition of the banking industry.|Theses Collection|Banking/bank distress/Central Bank of Nigeria/commercial and merchant banks/Auditor/fraud/loan/depositors' fund/banking industry/NDIC*||||||Freeman, Sola Akinyemi|M|A study of factors that can influence integration of Tuberculosis control into primary health care in Ilesa, Osun State, Nigeria||||||M.

Data were collected using an in-depth interview guide for TB patients and a semi-structured questionnaire for the primary health care workers. Qualitative information was collected from 6 homogenous groups of community members, by focus group discussions (FGD). Only 40% of patients came to hospital voluntarily. 56% were non resident in Ilesa. Compliance with treatment schedule was good, with 72% attending clinics regularly. It was discover that adequate social support and availability of free drugs positively influenced compliance. Half of the patients interviewed and 60% of PHC workers were not in support of integration. Among reasons given for opposing integration were issues related to the social stigma attached to TB. Furthermore PHC workers were of the opinion that PHC facilities should be for preventive rather than curative purpose. The general consensus of opinion during FGD was that integration should not be done in view of the associated social stigma. Opinion still favoured the establishment of separate facilities for TB patients. In view of the global drive towards integration of TB control into PHC, it is recommended that government should embark on massive social mobilization to solicit support for the proposed integration before implementation.|Theses Collection|Tuberculosis/availability of free drugs/social stigma/curative/primary health care workers/TB patients *||||||Olatinwo, Memudu Olaposi|M|Functional relations in a model for self-organizing systems||||||M.Sc.

Ile - Ife, Nigeria.The two cultivars of cowpea were planted in a randomised complete block design (RCBD), laid out in a split-plot arrangement in two seasons and treated with four sources of fertilizer (inorganic nitrogen fertilizer (NF), mixture of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer and poultry manure (NFPM), poultry manure (PM) and no fertilizer or manure treatment referred to as the control (C). Each fertilizer source supplied 20 kg N/ha basal dosage. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and the means were separated using the Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT).The variability and diversity observed were due to the genotypic variations of the crops, response to seasonal variation and response to fertilizer sources. The effect of fertilizer source on vegetative growth, nodulation, yield and yield components were significantly different from the control. Inorganic nitrogen fertilizer (NF) improved early vegetative growth, but had depressing effect on the number of nodules and of wet nodule weight unlike NFPM and PM, which improved vegetative growth, number of nodules and wet nodule weight.Grain yield and yield components were affected by fertilizer source, seasonal changes, cultivars and their interaction. Pod length (PL), number of pods per peduncle (PPE), however, the number of seeds per pod (NSP), one hundred seed weight (100SW) were not affected by treatments. However, the number of peduncles per plant (PEP), peduncle length (PEL), number of pods per plant (POP), dry pod weight (POW), biomass (BM) and grain yield per plant (YLD/PLT) were significantly influenced by treatments thus affecting the final yield of the two cultivars. Large canopy influenced the number of peduncle- bearing pods and the number of pods formed but did not affect the final  yield. The two cultivars showed no varietal differences on canopy, maturity period, PPE, PL, NSP, 100SW, SH% and %HI. However, varietal differences were observed on nodulation parameters, and some grain yield components such as PEP, PEL, POP, POW and YLD/PLT. Cultivar response to treatment effects on growth, nodulation and grain yield parameters were significant ( p = 0.05 ).The crude protein, percent crude fibre, total nitrogen and carbohydrate content of the grains varied among cultivars and were significantly improved by the fertilizer source, especially NFPM and PM. The significant response observed in the nutritional composition indicated differential utilization of nutrients under different treatments.The significant influence of NFPM and PM on the growth, nodulation and grain yield of cowpea indicated that the mobilization and utilization of nutrients under these conditions contributed on both the short run and the long run to the production of cowpea. These also contributed to the significant improvement of the nutrient components of the grains of the cultivars.|Theses Collection|Poultry manure/inorganic nitrogen fertilizer/cultivars/nodulation/randomised complete block design/Duncan Multiple Range Test/Pod length/peduncle*||||||Adesina, Charles Adeyemi|M|Determination of cocoa yield and hectarage in Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The procedure involved transforming the dependent variables (average productivity levels and farm size) plus five explanatory variables into a stationary covariance process. Stationarity test was conducted to ensure that the causal effect is not improperly attributed to serial correlation. Variables were expressed in logarithms and differencing was done until each variable was stationary. Granger Causality test was inferred for each variable by comparing the F-test computed from the full model and that from the appropriate equation. The computed F was compared with critical F-values at a given significant level. Based on the critical values, essentially all variables appeared not to be stationary in their levels which suggested differencing of the variables.The result suggested that single differencing was sufficient to obtain stationarity for all variables as their DF values were significantly negative at the 5% level, that is, the values were smaller than -2.333 (5% critical value). In addition, most of the explanatory variables were found to have causal effect (as suggested by multivariate causality test) on hectarage of cocoa cultivated in the period under review and simultaneously small farm sizes were found to influence o cause higher yield of cocoa. This means that larger farms would lead to less production per hectare, indicating that technological advances in cocoa agriculture might not require large farms for adoption and utilizations. The result also suggested to some extent, a bi-directional causality between cocoa yield and its hectarage as well as a non-existence of size economics by large cocoa farms in Nigeria in the period 1970-19%. The examination of additional factors affecting yield and hectarage in cocoa agriculture showed that producer price "caused" cocoa yield (production per hectare) while higher producer price did encourage higher production of cocoa per hectarage in contrast, producer price did not cause cocoa yield or the hectarage cultivated while rural wage rate had positive effect on the hectarage cultivated. In addition, annual rainfall impacted positively on the hectarage of cocoa cultivated but did not influence the yield of cocoa. Pesticide use was shown to be a significant determinant of cocoa output while fungicide application was found to Granger - cause cocoa hectarage.It is concluded that cocoa agriculture is essentially a small-holder undertaking and that fungicide use has greater - than one season influence on cocoa yield. Since there was a hi-directional causality between cocoa yield and hectarage, any policy measures, which positively influence cocoa yield would also do the same for cocoa hectarage.The reverse would also hold.|Theses Collection|Cocoa/pesticides/Granger Causality Procedures/farm size/ producer price/agriculture/cocoa yield/hectarage*||||||Ojo, Matthews Akintunde|M|The administration of the Nigeria guinea worm eradication programme in Oyo State||||||M.Sc.

The primary data were collected using a structured interview guide with the officers of NIGEP, community leaders in the affected communities, and Guinea worm sufferers. In particular, responses were sought regarding the adequacy and/or effectiveness of the following intervention strategies: health education; provision of water filters and abate chemicals for the removal of cyclops from infected water; the provision of safe drinking water sources such as bore holes and deep wells in the endemic communities; and other health care facilities available to Guinea worm sufferers. In addition, questions were asked regarding the administrative structure of NIGEP, the frequency of the visits of NIGEP field officers and their activities during such visits, and the involvement of the local government authorities in the eradication programme. Secondary data were extracted from books, articles, statistical reports, and bulletins of the World Health Organisation, the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Carter Foundation Programme on Guinea Worm Eradication.The findings of the study showed that Oyo State still ranks as one of the five most endemic states in the country, with 1102 recorded cases in 1999, 1207 cases in 1998, and 1180 cases in 1997. The crucial factor for the non-attainment of the goal of NIGEP was identified as the centralization of the Guinea Worm Eradication Programme at the Federal level with minimal involvement of the states and local governments. The study also revealed that the local communities where Guinea worm is endemic often lack basic social services such as portable and safe water. Furthermore, community-based efforts for the eradication of dracunculiasis in the endemic villages were weak.The study concluded that a multi-dimensional approach is needed in combating the prevalence of Guinea worm disease instead of treating the problem purely as a health issue. In addition, overhauling the administrative and operational structures of NIGEP could provide a more positive impact on the eradication programme in the state.|Theses Collection|Nigeria Guinea Worm Eradication Programme/dracunculiasis/endemic/health education/cyclops/World Health Organisation/United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention/Carter Foundation Programme on Guinea Worm Eradication/Guinea Worm*||||||Olomoshua, Olaosebikan Ipinlaye|M|Cooperative inputs in the delivery of health services in Ibadan and Akure, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The first set was used to elicit information from serving local government officials while the second one was used to complement information provided in the first questionnaire. The purposive sampling method was adopted whereby fifteen out of the thirty local governments in Osun State in 1999 were sampled to represent the six geo-political areas of the state. Serving and retired government officials were interviewed, especially those who were connected with the workings and operations of the Local Government Service Commission.Secondary data were collected from textbooks and leading journals on human resources management, as well as from relevant official documents. Data collected were analysed, using descriptive statistics such as frequency distribution, percentages and histogram.The study revealed that the Local Government Service Commission of Osun State, on the whole, performed poorly in planning, developing and utilizing the manpower resources at its disposal from 1991 to 1999. This was as a result of poor leadership, weak  followership, ineffective human resources management and lack of political stability. It was further discovered that some of the activities of the Osun State Government had negative impacts, such as indiscipline among the generality of the local government career staff and over staffing of the local governments, which had resulted into wasteful expenditure on personal emoluments.In conclusion, the study justified the need to man the executive cadre of the Local Government Service Commission with experienced public administrators. It also justified the need to design a systematic approach to the training and development of local government employees in Osun State in particular and Nigeria at large.|Theses Collection|Manpower/planning and development/1976 Local Government Reforms/leadership/human resources management/political stability/indiscipline  *||||||Ojo, Matthew Olugoke|M|Investigation of planetary boundary layer structure over a tropical station using an acoustic sounder||||||M.Sc.

This study was aimed at an understanding of the PBL structure and the associated atmospheric stability. It was also to validate the applicability of the acoustic sounder in monitoring the depth or the mixed layer.This study examined the data obtained from Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU).

Vertical wind shear profiles associated Unit the cases were derived and the wind shear Isopleths were drawn especially for 29th & 30th May: 19th & 30th June. 1991. For an integration time of 30 minutes, values of the vertical velocity variance were calculated. The variation turbulence intensity and vertical velocity, variance with time at three chosen levels were analyzed so as to assess the stability of the atmosphere. Furthermore, the prevailing circulation patterns in the station were analyzed using relevant weather charts for surface and 300hpa levels.The wind shear isopleths showed some regions of strong cells (area covered by distinct circulation patterns). Turbulence intensity parameters calculated for each day revealed that the parameters attained a maximum value during the day time of convective activity. The vertical wind shear du/dz in the lower 100m was consistently small (<.15) and fell within the air safety limit or threshold. The study revealed further that the hourly mean layer height for Ile- Ife ranged between 100m and 250m. The nocturnal boundary layer was much shallower than the day time boundary layer.Conclusively, the height of Ekman Layer (ZE = 1.47km) obtained for Ile-Ife portrayed a good indication of shallow disturbed tropical boundary layer.|Theses Collection|Acoustic sounder/planetary boundary layer/Inner- Tropical discontinuity/synoptic weather charts/wind shear Isopleths/turbulence intensity/Ekman Layer/ nocturnal boundary layer  *||||||Ofuyah, Williams Nirorowan|M|A comparative study of surface seismic and vertical seismic profile (V.S.P.) modelling.

The method is based on the solution of the time-domain wave equation in one-dimension (I-D). Other numerical algorithms, for seismic velocity filtering, sonic log smoothening and time-to-depth conversion were also developed and applied in the data processing for the onshore and offshore environments of the areas of study.The results of the analysis and interpretation of the three oil fields data sets have yielded information required for distinguishing between primary and multiple reflections on seismic sections. Various geologic horizons that are boundaries to hydrocarbon reservoirs have also been accurately located. In Obodo field, the three main horizons, H01 H03 are located at depths 1177, 3529, and 12235ft respectively. In the Star field, the three main horizons, Hs1  Hs3 are located at depths 4083, 4312, and 5395ft respectively, while for the Utai field, the four main horizons, Hu1  Hu4 are located at depths 6857, 7714, 8786, and 10714ft respectively. The main hydrocarbon reservoirs located for the Obodo, Star and Utai oil fields are three, two and one respectively, and have been found to be potentially hydrocarbon bearing. The average of the bulk porosity values of all the reservoirs in each of the fields is 22% for Obodo, 37% for Star and 31% for Utai.In conclusion, the surface seismic section and the S.V.S.P. generated from sonic log are comparable. This result is generally independent of the type of source wavelet used for model simulation, and it confirms the validity of the algorithm developed. Hence field seismic data can be reprocessed in order to facilitate a more successful interpretation of the surface seismic section. This will lead to enhanced hydrocarbon exploitation and production in the areas of study.|Theses Collection|Utai oil fields/seismic sections/synthetic vertical seismic profile/hydrocarbon reservoir models/geologic models/Pascal programming language/seismic velocity filtering/sonic log smoothening/porosity/wavelenght/hydrocarbon *||||||Asaolu,T.O.|M|Financing small scale enterprises in Ondo State of Nigeria||||||M.Phil.

The study was considered necessary because of an observed anomaly that despite an increase in female participation in the labour force, the segregation of sexes across occupations remains a basic feature of the world of work worldwide. The academic profession in Nigeria was chosen as the point of focus, because since the inception of University education in Nigeria in 1948, the number of female academics remains insignificant when compared with that of their male counterparts. Obafemi Awolowo University which was chosen as a case study had 928 male and 96 female academic staff. These observations created puzzles which the study sought to explore.Data for the study were collected from both primary and secondary sources. Primary data were obtained through the use of questionnaire and in-depth interview. The questionnaire were administered to academic staff selected using a combination of the purposive, snowball and stratified sampling methods. Purposively selected academic staffs were also interviewed. Secondary data were obtained from texts in the library and official sources. Simple statistical techniques like percentages and the Chi-square were used in analysing the data.The study revealed that the recruitment and selection practices of Obafemi Awolowo University did not stress male ideology, rather merit was the yardstick for acceptance into the profession. However, it was observed that men still dominated the academic profession in the University. It was also observed that subtle discrimination against women existed on the job and it was exhibited more at the attitudinal level. It was also revealed that though the stressful nature of the profession was a disincentive for women, it was not the total explanation for their under-representation. Other factors found responsible included: family and domestic responsibilities especially the female reproductive function and child care , poor renumeration, poor working facilities, women's lack of interest in the profession and the lengthy period of training involved in qualifying to be an academic. Inspite of the factors identified, it was revealed that some women were able to cope with the rigours associated with the profession and even excelled. As a result of the findings, the study concluded by stressing education as a critical ingredient in empowering women to feature in the academic profession. For the relevant authorities to achieve this, appropriate legislation and affirmative action programmes were considered necessary. In addition, the removal of administrative bottlenecks with regards to post-graduate programmes, the operation of consistent university calendar devoid of unrest, as well as the provision of grants for female post graduate students were also considered necessary. Also, a variety of institutional adjustments should be made to enable women maintain balance between work and family responsibilities. Finally, the provision of an attractive remuneration package. |Theses Collection|Gender/recruitment/academic staff/labour force/poor working facilities/lengthy period of training/administrative bottlenecks/family responsibilities/schlarship/grants  *||||||Akamo, Olajide Abayomi|M|Effect of nitrogen fertilizer and euphorbia heterophylia linn. on the growth, yield and photosynthetic pigments of macrotyloma geocarpa  (Harms) marechal and baudet ||||||M.Sc.

There was another treatment which was a combination of the two stresses. Fertilizer application of the crops was achieved by broadcasting NPK fertilizers at 0, 15 and 30kg Nha-1 in the Kersting's groundbean seedling plots.Plants grown under nitrogen fertilizer did better in terms of above ground or total biomass. root length, shoot height, leaf weight ratio (LWR) and seed yield. These increased at successive harvest intervals. For the plants under a combination of the two stresses however, all the above parameters except (LWR) were reduced at the end of the experiment. The coefficient of variation showed that the means of the dry matter production varied on both weed competition and at different nitrogen levels. Leaf Area (LA), Leaf Area Ratio (LAR), Specific Leaf Area (SLA), Leaf Area Duration (LAD), Relative Growth Rate (RGR), Leaf Area Index (LAI), Net Assimilation Rate (NAR) and the measured biochemical composition of the plant such as photosynthetic pigment accumulation, nitrogen, ash, crude fibre, crude protein, fat. carbohydrates and lignin contents did not show a regular pattern at successive harvest times during the investigation.Results showed that 15KgN/ha-1 was adequate for good yield. In the present investigation, the level of N for fertilizer at lower dose of 15kg N/ha-1 improved improved growth and yield over and above those of the double dose of (30kg N/ha-1) and the zero fertilizer application. Analysis of relative yield showed that the crop became more competitive than the weed from the beginning to the end of the experiment in all treatments. Relative yield of the mixture was greater than 1.0 indicating that the yield of the mixed culture was greater than the mean of the two monocultures.In conclusion, it was noted that Macrotyloma geocarpa responded to a small dose (15kg N/ha-1) of N fertilizer. The N fertilizer applied at planting acted primarily as a growth booster, though still with significant effect on yield.Finally, perhaps it is about time Macrotyloma geocarpa breeders started giving as much attention to the development of fertilizer responsive varieties of Macrotyloma geocarpa as they had devoted on the weed control in the crop plantation.|Theses Collection|Macrotyloma geocarpa/nitrogen fertilizer/photosynthetic pigment accumulation/Kersting's groundbean/spurge weed/biomass/carbohydrates/lignin contents/Leaf Area Ratio/Relative Growth Rate  *||||||Oguntuase, James Adedayo|M|On weighted norms inequalities for a certain class of integral operators||||||P.h.D.

To achieve these objectives, a brief survey of the basic concepts of Hardy-type inequalities was critically considered. This was followed with a review of some known results on weighted norm inequalities and their applications.Thereafter, some elementary methods of analysis were used to establish some new generalizations of Hardy's integral inequality. An improvement of some inequalities was given and the connections to related results in the literature were vividly presented.Furthermore, a general integral operator of the form  (Tf) (x) =?x-8	(, y)f (y)dy or	(x, y)f (y)dy	xin the index range 1 < p < q < oo was studied and by exploiting the monotonicity of the kernel of the integral operator, conditions on the non-negative weight functions u and v which ensure the validity of an inequality of the form< c (Too f(x)v(x) ~~l )p dxl (1-13)P l were obtained. In addition, it was shown that the above inequality was reversed in the case 0 < p,q < 1. Applications of these results to convolution integrals and the Laplace transform were given.Using the Jensen's inequality, new weighted norm inequalities for Hardy-type operators involving the use of adjoint operators were obtained. Furthermore, new criteria were obtained for which the Riemann-Liouville integral operators were, bounded.The problem of estimation of the size of a function in terms of its derivatives were critically studied. New weighted criteria were obtained for functions involving its derivatives and applications of our results to the study of the existence of the solutions of differential equations and in establishing the Copson's type integral inequalities were given.Thereafter, new inequalities for fractional order Hardy-type inequalities were proved and applied. In particular, the general mixed noun case and a general two-dimensional weight were obtained and their connections to the related results in the literature were pointed out.Finally, the mapping properties for certain classes of integral operators were also examined and in particular, characterizations for those pair of weight functions for which the Hardy-Steklov operator was bounded in weighted Lebesgue spaces were presented.Furthermore, our results were used in establishing the modular inequality for which the Hardy averaging operators were bounded in a weighted Lebesgue spaces.The results obtained in this thesis represent some significant improvements on existing results on weighted norm inequalities. They extended and generalized some known results in the literature.|Theses Collection|Weighted norm inequalities/weighted Lebesgue spaces/Hardy's integral inequality/Laplace transform/Riemann-Liouville integral operators/Copson's type integral/Hardy-Steklov operator    *||||||Otemuyiwa, Israel  Olusegun|M|Chemical composition of some herbs used in local therapy for anaemia||||||M.Sc.

The study was designed with a view to provide scientific evidence or otherwise on the usefulness of these herbs as alternative source of blood enhancing remedies.The effect of the decoction of these herbs on the in-vitro available minerals (iron, zinc, calcium and magnesium) from improved Cowpea (Vigna unquiculata (L) Walp IT 81°994 and IT 86° 1010) were evaluated and compared with the effect of ascorbic acid on mineral availability from the same cowpeas. The total, soluble and available minerals of herbs, cowpea and composite meals were carried out by in-vitro digestion techniques while minerals were analysed using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. The study also involved analysis of the ash content by the method of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC Method), tannins, ascorbic acid and total anthocyanin by colorimetric method, phytate by anion exchange method and phytochemical screening for the presence of alkaloids and saponins while the pH of the decoctions were also taken with pH meter.Result of the experiments showed the ash contents of the herbs ranged between 3.5 and 7.2%, ascorbic acid between 250 and 625mg/kg, total anthocyanim from 57-150mg/kg calculated as cyanidin - 3 - glucoside equivalent, tannin from 7.0 to 46g/kg catechin equivalent. Phytate was not detected in any of the samples. The tannin content of the decoctions ranged from 0.2 to 2% of the total tannin content of the herbs while the pH ranged between 3.2 to 6.7. Hibiscus  sabdariffa had the highest mineral (iron. zinc, calcium and magnesium) which were readily available. Theobroma cacao root recorded the least soluble minerals but recorded the highest percentage available zinc and second highest in iron and calcium from the soluble minerals. This study showed that ascorbic acid enhanced iron and zinc availability but inhibited calcium and magnesium from legumes Decoction of the herbs enhanced the availability of all minerals with the exception of calcium which was inhibited by H. sabdariffa decoction.From the results it can be concluded that the decoction of H. sabdariffa if taken in sufficient quantity could supply the needed mineral while decoction of other herbs would enhance mineral availability from other food sources thereby improving their mineral status.|Theses Collection|Local therapy/in-vitro digestion/Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer/alkaloids and saponins/anthocyanim/anaemia/tannin/Sorghum bicolor/Theobroma cacao   *||||||Ayoola, Muritala Ajayi|M|A coustic sounder monitoring of low-level air jets in the boundary layer over Ile-Ife Osun State, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The main objectives of the research are to identify specific cases of low level jet within the planetary boundary layer as revealed by an acoustic sounder, analyse the wind field that are associated with low-level jet, examine the structural evolution of low-level jets with the boundary layer and discuss possible application of knowledge gained on such studies.The data obtained between June and August 1991 have been utilized for the study. Processed for this purpose were more than 336 different data which have been obtained for the period following a series of checks carried out to assume a high degree of accuracy in the data set. It is found that jet cases (strong air currents) were prominent at the early hours 0400-0900 GMT and late afternoon 1400-1800 GMT with the speed ranging between 6.0ms-1 and 12.5ms-1 in the low-level planetary boundary layer.Cases of low-level jets occurred at 220m, 330m, 550m, 650m and 700m height during the month of the year used for the study and this established the influence of temperature gradient on wind speed. The profiles were analyzed concerning the applicability of computer system and Nieuwstadt equation whereby comparison of results was made possible.In conclusion, the cross-sectional analysis of the contours revealed pronounced cases of jet at 6.Oms-1, 7.5ms-1 and 10ms-1 which enabled the possible determination of the effect of air currents (jet stream) in the planetary boundary layer. These strong winds persisted without change of direction and there are some evidence to suggest that the occurrence of low-level jet streams is associated in some way with outbreaks of cool air.|Theses Collection|Tri-axial acoustic sounder/planetary boundary layer/air jets/GMT/low-level jets/wind speed/temperature gradient/Nieuwstadt equation  *||||||Obadimu, Samuel Olalekan|M|Determination of 210Pb concentrations in sediments and surface soil around Obafemi Awolowo University||||||M.Sc.

Measurement of contribution of 210Pb to the radioactivity burden of soil at different soil depths around Obafemi Awolowo University and the concentrations of 210Pb in sediments of Opa Reservoir was carried out.Thirty-seven samples were analysed out of which ten were sediments from various points in Opa Reservoir. The remaining twenty-seven were surface soil from nine different locations around the Campus, from which samples were taken at 0 - 5cm, 5-10cm and 10- 15cm levels. The surface soil sample were collected from All Soul's Chapel environment, New Bukateria site, Angola Hall of residence, Old Bukateria site, Faculty of Agriculture ground, Civil Engineering building site, Pharmacy building site, Health Centre and Physics building site.The samples were oven dried at 60°C for eight hours. 0.5g of each sample was digested using 6N HCI. 209Po standard was added to each sample before digestion. Polonium in the digested sample was plated on to copper disc and counted for 36000s in a Camberra alpha spectrometer.The mean concentration of 210Pb obtained for the sediments was 47.73fg.g-1.

Thirty composite samples were taken from the cocoa plantations sprayed with the fungicide at depths of 0-15cm, 15-30cm and 30-60cm. Fifteen composite samples were taken from five cocoa plantations without the copper fungicide application and fifteen composite samples from five fallow or cultivated lands where Copper fungicides were not applied. The 2mm sieve soil samples were also ground to pass through 0.5mm sieve for the estimation of organic carbon (organic matter).The exchangeable cations were extracted with neutral IM ammonium acetate. K+ and Na+ were determined by flame photometry, while Cat+ and Mg2+ were determined by AAS. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) was determined with IM KCI extraction followed by Kjeldahl distillation procedure. Organic matter was determined by dichromate oxidation and titrimetric methods while available phosphorus was extracted with Bray P and determined by vanadomolybdate spectrometric method. Inorganic  N was determined by 2M KCI extraction followed by 50% NaOH treatment, Kjeldahl distillation and titrimetric method. Extractable trace metals were extracted with 0.05M EDTA and the concentrations determined by ASS. pH was determined by glass electrode (pH meter) in 1:2.5 soil-water suspension.The results revealed that the fungicide residues significantly increased the pH value, OM and Cu contents but lowered the concentration of inorganic  N, available  P and exchangeable K+ and Na+ in the soil. Slight increase in the concentrations of the CEC, exchangeable Ca2+ and Mg2+ was observed while the effects on other trace metals were not well defined.It is concluded that fungicide residues in soils under cocoa plantations through Blackpod disease control predispose the soils to N, P and K deficiency and perhaps to copper toxicity.

Khaya ivorensis and Citrus sinensis were investigated. These seeds were collected from farm/yards around Ile-Ife, Ifetedo (Osun State) and Ugwolawo (Kogi State) during the 1998 season. The study was designed to evaluate the possible use of the seeds as food or feed supplements, and to draw attention to the suitability or otherwise of their oils for both consumption and industrial uses.The dehulled and flaked seeds were subjected to proximate analysis involving moisture, crude oil, ash, crude protein, crude fibre and carbohydrate contents determination. Estimation of the seeds mineral composition (K, Na, Ca, Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu, Pb and Cd) was also carried out using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. Oils extracted by Soxhlet apparatus were evaluated for the following values: saponification, free fatty acid, ester, iodine, peroxide, unsaponifiable matter content and fatty acid profile (using Gas Liquid Chromatography). The specific gravity, viscosity and dielectric constant values at various temperatures were also measured. The techniques used were mainly those of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC).The proximate analysis results showed the following ranges: moisture content from 5.30-8.98%; oil content from 32.45  48.33%; ash content from 3.61-5.04%; crude protein content from 15.82-45.87%; crude fibre value from 8.19-20.55%; and carbohydrate content from 2.38-15.38%. The potassium content of the seeds ranged between 348.95 and 468.62 ppm while their magnesium content ranged from 83.71-150.09 ppm. No oleic acid was detected in Hura crepitans and Citrus sinensis had no linoleic acid, but all other oils were fair sources of oleic and linoleic acids. Oleic acid content ranged from 14.6-72.1% while linoleic acid content varied between 10.6% in Jatropha curcas to 96.3% in Hura crepitans. Saponification value ranged from 201.96  210.38; iodine value ranged from 75.57  149.18 and unsaponifiable matter content lied between 0.70 and L67%. Specific gravity of the oils varied between 0.9004 and 0.9113 at 80°C and 0.9151  0.9275 at 20°C. Viscosity values ranged from 7.35  9.41 cp at 80°C and 38.44  60.34 cp at 30°C. Dielectric constant values ranged from 1.75-3.88 within the temperature range of 26  80°C. Surface tension values at 28.5°C and refractive index values at 28°C were not less than 0.03 492 Nm-1 and 1.46469 respectively.The study showed that Cucumeropsis edulis, Hevea brasiliensis and Hura crepitans seeds particularly might serve as food for humans and feeds for animals. With the essential fatty acid (linoleic acid, C182) content as high as 96.3% in Hura crepitans oil, the seed was speculated to be a good source of edible oil. Obviously, all the oils would serve as chemical raw materials for toiletries and perfumes.|Theses Collection|Oilseeds/feed supplements/dehulled  seeds/flaked seeds/Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer/Soxhlet apparatus/Gas Liquid Chromatography/saponification/Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC)/mineral composition/viscocity/perfumes*||||||Ogunba, Olusegun Adebayo|M|Pre-development appraisal and risk adjustment techniques for property investment in southwestern Nigeria||||||Ph.D Estate Management|Cyril Ayo Ajayi||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Estate Management|2002|||OAU|||||xviii,258p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

In accosting this problem, the objectives were to identify development risks factors and the influence of such factors on development variables, to investigate the perceptions of risk and risk adjustment methods of three stakeholders -- estate surveyors, corporate developers, and development lenders - and to develop a model for adjusting for risk in development appraisal.A systems approach to research was adopted, synchronizing views of the three stakeholders. Employing a stratified systematic sampling framework, questionnaire surveys were conducted on calculated sample sizes of each of these stakeholders, that is, 193 estate surveying firms drawn from a sample frame of 261 firms (distributed amongst the six state capitals), 111 lending institutions drawn from a sample frame of 122 institutions (distributed amongst commercial, merchant and mortgage banks) -and 17 purposively selected corporate developers (distributed according to public and private ownership). Seven techniques were chosen for the purpose of evaluating the expected outcomes, amongst with are factor analysis, relative importance indices, the chi-square test, analysis of variance, and the coefficient of correlation.The analysis of data established that unsuccessful developments were caused principally by three risk factors. namely higher than expected construction costs, interest rates, construction period. In adjusting for these risks, it was determined that most surveyors employ an optimistic scenario (that is, they base predictions of development variables on an assumption that the values of development variables would not get worse than they are as at the date of appraisal), rather than a cautious use of estimates more pessimistic than that obtainable at the date of appraisal. It was further established that such a procedure goes up against the somewhat more pessimistic risk profile of the other two stakeholders. Surveyors were also found to employ rudimentary adjustments of volatile variables such as higher construction costs and costs of capital, rather than sensitivity or probabilistic analysis. It was ascertained moreover that the adjustment for risk via the usage of sophisticated techniques by all stakeholders is very inhibited by the statistical and computer related complexities associated with such techniques. On the basis of these findings, the study developed and tested a computer software model for Nigerian development appraisal practice, which calculates development profit and tests for the probabilistic sensitivity of such profit to pessimistic scenario variations in the three identified significant risk factors.The study concluded with the need to restructure the Nigerian development appraisal syllabuses, develop a functioning development database and a repackage risk-adjustment technique propounded by the academia to bring them into formats that are easy to use by practitioners and their clients.|Theses Collection|Pre-development viability/appraisals/estate developments/construction costs/interest rates/construction period/risk profile/ *||||||Ajala, Abiodun Oladayo|M|Impact of Agricultural credit on adoption of improved farm practices in Osun State of Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The operational mechanism of the credit source was also examined.The study was conducted in two selected zones of Osun State. Osogbo and Ikirun zones were purposively selected because of their proximity to the headquarters of the Osun State Agricultural Credit Corporation at Ila-Orangun. Both primary and secondary data were involved in the study. The secondary data were extracted from documented facts while the primary data were collected with structured interview schedule. The data collection was carried out between November and December, 1999. A total of 110 respondents were selected for interview using the random sampling technique. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data and t-test was employed to test the hypotheses.The results showed that the mean income of the respondents was N61,750.00 before obtaining credit and N85,020.00 after obtaining credit. The mean farm size of the respondents was 3.4 hectares before obtaining credit and 4.2 hectares after obtaining credit.The mean annual farm expense was N9,800.00 before obtaining credit and N12,500.00 after obtaining credit. The mean of the amount in savings was N7,800.00 before obtaining credit and N8,790.00 after obtaining credit. There was little or no difference in the mean number of crops cultivated before obtaining credit (6.02,) and after obtaining credit (6.05). Friends/relatives and neigbours were the most important sources of awareness of improved farm practices. About 75% of the respondents were aware of all the improved farm practices. The mean number of the improved farm practices adopted before obtaining credit was four, while it was five after obtaining credit. Osun State Agricultural Credit Corporation is very accessible to farmers. The credit disbursed was grossly inadequate and irregular. The second most important source of obtaining credit was the cooperative society. The result of the hypotheses showed that there were significant differences between the following variables before and after obtaining credit: income (t=2.7), extension contact (t=1.94) and farmers' training, (t=1.85) at 0.05 level of significance. Also there was significant difference between the number of improved practices adopted by the respondents before and after obtaining credit (t=2.7). In conclusion, credit has made a positive impact on the farmers' adoption of improved farm practices and their standard of living.|Theses Collection|Agriculture/Agricultural credit/farm size/dependents/Osun State Agricultural Credit Corporation/cooperative society/farm expense/improved farm practices *||||||Olaniyi, Akeem Olawale|M|The impact of salinity on the spread of crude oil spill in water||||||M.Sc.

The objective of the study was to determine the effect of salinity on the rate of spread of crude oil in water.The water samples were collected from the Bar Beach Lagos (sea water), Lagos Lagoon (Estuarine water), Opa Reservoir (Fresh water) and Botany Department, OAU, Ile-Ife (Distilled water). The salinity and conductivity of the water samples were determined using the conductivity meter, while pH was determined using the pH comparator. Ca 2+, Mg2+ and Cl- were determined titrimetrically while Na+ and K+ were determined by the flame photometric method. Four types of crude oils (Lagomar, Bonny Medium, Forcados Light and Bonny Light) were used for the study and all were collected from the Department of Petroleum Resources, Lagos. The corporation also supplied the basic physical properties of the crude oils. (Specific gravity, viscosity, surface tension and API gravity). Three tanks, each measuring 55 X 22 X 55 cm were used for the experiment. For each crude oil and water types, the three tanks were filled with the appropriate water samples before three volumes of crude oil (2.3 ml, 10 ml and 15 ml) representing small, medium and large spills were released separately on each of the three tanks using a pipette to avoid undue disturbance of the Water column. The time taken for the spreading front in each tank to reach designated marks (10 cm, 20 cm 30 cm, 40 cm and 50 cm) were recorded.Results obtained showed that on the basis of salinity levels, the water samples used for the experiment could be broadly divided into low salinity waters low salinity levels (0  0.1°/o) and high salinity levels (21  35 o/o). The fresh and distilled water are of low salinity, while brackish and sea waters are of high salinity levels. For any given volume of oil spill, light crudes spread faster than heavy crudes. For instance, 2.3 ml of Bonny Light spilled on sea water reached a 10 cm mark in 21 secs while the same volume of Lagomar in the same water reached the same 10 cm mark in 38 secs. In contrast, crude oils irrespective of their weights and volumes, spread faster in high salinity waters than in low salinity waters. For example Bonny Light reached 10 cm mark in 21 secs and 39 secs in sea water and distilled water respectively. Statistical analysis using one way analysis of variance at 5% confidence level indicated that as salinity of the aquatic medium and the volume of the oil spilled increased the rate of spread also increased significantly while as oil viscosity increased the rate of spread decreases significantly.In terms of volume effect, large spills spread faster than small spills irrespective of crude oil and salinity of water involved. For example, small and large spills of Bonny Light in estuarine water reached the 10 cm mark in 25 secs and 16 secs, respectively, the same volumes of Lagomar crude in the same water reached the same mark in 47 secs and 30 secs respectively. A log-log plot of the mean time taken the spreading front to reach the predetermined mark against distance covered showed that crude oils spread in three phases of different spreading rates namely: gravity-inertia phase (5.44 cm/secs), gravity-viscous phase (2.74 cm/secs) and surface tension-viscous phase (1.33 cm/secs).Although field application of these findings might be limited by some hydrodynamics factors in natural water bodies, the study had provided useful information for predicting possible environmental effects of oils spills in aquatic environments. It also defined the basis for decision-making on where and when to apply dispersants and other control measures against sensitive sites that were likely to be impacted by oil spills.|Theses Collection|Crude oil/salinity levels/flame photometric method/Lagos lagoon(Estuarine water)/bar beach lagos(sea water)/Opa reservoir (Fresh water)/oil spill/water pollution/water bodies/gravity-inertia phase/gravity-viscous phase/surface tension-viscous phase/largomar crude *||||||Adeyoju, Motunrayo Alice|F|Comparative study of short-stay hospitalised patients'expectations and actual experiences of nursing care in a teaching hospital||||||M.Sc.

It also examined the extent to which the nursing care received by patients met their expectations. Furthermore, the study examined the influence of socio-demographic characteristics (sex, age, and level of education) of the patients, on their expectations and actual experiences of nursing care.Eighty (80) subjects (forty-three (43) males and thirty-seven (37) females) short-stay hospitalized patients from the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, who were randomly selected, participated in the study. The instrument used for data collection was an interview guide structured on three point rating scales of "Always" "Sometimes" and "Rarely". The data was analysed using percentages, t-test, Chi-square and Pearson's Product Moment Correlation Analyses.The study revealed that patients' expectations of nursing care in the areas of elimination, recreation and play, health education, psycho-social, dying and bereavement needs were different from the actual care they received in these areas during hospitalization (P = <0.05). The result showed  nursing care (r = 0.06 P=>0.05) and (r = -.430 P=<0.05). Younger patients had higher expectations and actual experiences of nursing care than the older patients.

This was done to assess the adequacy or otherwise of the United Nations' response to contemporary African crises in the post-Cold War era in view of the Organizations commitment to ensuring the maintenance and protection of international peace and security.The study is largely a library-based one in which both the analytical and the descriptive-historical approaches were employed to furnish the economic, socio-political and religious background to the crisis as well as to examine the United Nations' efforts in finding a solution to the crisis. Both primary and secondary sources in the form of books, journal articles, and reports in both local and foreign newspapers and magazines were consulted.It was found that the United Nations' role in the Rwandan crisis attracted a lot of criticisms and condemnations particularly because of the hasty and panicky withdrawal of her forces just as the slaughter was underway to many observers of the Rwandan crisis, this singular act was an inexcusable abnegation of responsibility, which shows that the Organisation lacks the political will to effectively handle an emergency situation. The study also revealed that it was very unrealistic to expect the United Nations to get involved in every conflict in every corner of the globe without over-stretching its resources, manpower, logistics and capability.In conclusion, the findings from this study further buttressed the call for the establishment of regional bodies to complement the efforts of the United Nations in conflict management and resolution.|Theses Collection|United  Nations'/conflict resolution/Africa/Rwandan crisis/post-Cold War era/international peace/security *||||||Oji, Geoffrey Nwabunike|M|Postmodernism and understanding African culture||||||M.A. Philosophy|Oladipo Fashina||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Philosophy|2002|||OAU|||||vii,145p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

It also examined the attempts by some African philosophers to rediscover the identity of Africa in the light of postmodernist thought.The research methodology included the analysis of the ideas of leading postmodernist thinkers such as J.F. Lyotard, L. Wittgenstein, R. Rorty and J. Habermas. The views of some African philosophers such as K. Wiredu, V.Y. Mudimbe and K.A. Appiah were critically examined. Textual analysis and philosophical criticism were used to evaluate concepts and ideas of postmodernism and African cultural identity.The thesis found that postmodernism criticized modernity for the abstract formality of reason which robbed it of content when it was enthroned at the expense of emotion and will.   Also, if we are to go by Habermas' suggestion not to reject reason, we should unite reason, emotion and will. Each of them should retain its identity, so that the separation for which modernity was criticized would be overcome.Furthermore, the thesis found that on the basis of postmodernist viewpoint, there are no superior cultures.  On the basis of these, the thesis concluded that cultural pluralism is justified, and cultural relativism is plausible. And also, that the postmodernist approach to the understanding of African culture is fruitful and should be further explored.|Theses Collection|Postmodernism/African culture/African philosophers/L.

Descriptive statistics such as mean, percentage and standard deviation were used to analyze the data while, correlation and regression analyses were used to establish relationships and effect, respectively.The results showed that the mean age of arable crop farmers in the state was 51.7 years. Majority (95.4%) were married with large family size of eight members and above. Most of the arable crop farmers still cultivated between 2.1 and 4.0 hectares. About 73% of arable crop farmers were indigenes and majority (86.7%), had travelled widely, with 8.3% being members of organizations which had contributed positively to arable crop production. Majority (96%) of the respondents had extension agent as their source of agricultural information. Sixty-seven percent of the arable crop farmers depended on organized cooperative societies as sources of credit, while 98% had contact with extension agents. The mean contact was 18.65 out of the maximum of 26 per annum. Also, the mean number of training sessions the extension agent had with the farmers was 15 per annum. Majority of these farmers had received improved technologies on arable crops production from extension agents and many had adopted the technologies. Majority of arable crop farmers owned land through inheritance and only the father as head of the family took decisions on what crop to be planted.The results showed positive significant correlations among the following variables and production of arable crops; age and farming experience (r 0.472), production practice and age (r = 0.311) and access to input and number of farm practices adopted (r = 0.302) among others.

The objective of this study were; to examine the procedures and factors considered in the determination of contract period; to assess the procedures and factors considered in the determination of tender sum and to examine the relationship between contract period and tender sum for building projects in South-Western Nigeria.Data used for this study were obtained through structured questionnaires administered on quantity surveyors of private firms and contracting organizations, selected using the systematic sampling techniques. Eighty-two completed projects were also examined and used for the establishment of a time-cost relationship model. The analyses of data collected were carried out using statistical techniques such as percentages, averages, relative importance index (RIB), regression analysis and hypothesis testing.The study revealed that factors affecting tender sum determination included type and scope of work, prevailing economic conditions, profit level, method of tender selection and degree of competition. Similarly, factors affecting the determination of contract period were found to include availability of resources, type and scope of work, location and access to site, experience gained from previous work and weather conditions. The results further showed that there existed a non-linear relationship between contract period and tender sum. The time-cost relationship model established was in the form CP=K(TS)B where CP represents contract period in working days, TS represents tender sum in millions of naira adjusted to 1998 price levels, K is the constant describing the general level of duration performance for #1 million and B is the constant describing how the duration performance is affected by project size as measured by value. K was found. to be 33 working days and B was 0.111.It was concluded from the result that many factors were crucial in the determination of tender sum and contract period of building projects in Nigeria. The relationship between contact period and tender sum can be modeled in the form CP=K(TS)B and the best predictor of average construction time of building projects in Nigeria was CP=33(TS)0.111. The result will enable the quantity surveyor to concentrate on significant factors affecting contract period and tender sum in order to achieve a realistic and reliable estimate. In addition, the established model serves as a tool for predicting the time using the cost of building projects at the preliminary estimating stage.|Theses Collection|Contract period/tender sum/construction projects/construction industry/relative importance index/economic conditions/profit level/location/access to site/experience/weather conditions/quantity surveyor  *||||||Aihonsu, John Olusegun Yetongo|M|Comparative economic analysis of upland and swamp rice production systems in Ogun State, Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Agricultural Economics|A.A.

The study examined the production techniques and cultural practices in rice production; analyzed costs and returns to the two rice production systems; compared their income-generating capacities; and examined economic competitiveness of rice production with other food crops in the area.Primary data were generated using two sets of questionnaire in a field survey of 82 upland and 66 swamp rice farmers drawn in proportion to the estimated number of each type of rice farmers in the State in year 2000. The analytical techniques adopted comprised descriptive statistics, budgeting, production function, linear programming and sensitivity analysis. Linear and Cobb-Douglas functional forms were respectively selected to explain upland and swamp rice productions.The budgetary analysis revealed that labour costs alone constituted between 69 and 76 percent of the total cost of production, and the farmers on the average spent between 11 and 13 percent of the total cost on fixed inputs. The average gross margin realised by upland rice farmers was N26, 085.30/ha compared with N11,862.50/ha recorded by swamp rice farmers. A major factor responsible for the wide disparity was the relatively higher incidence of birds' invasion and loss of potential rice harvest suffered by the swamp rice farmers. The expense-structure ratios of 0.134 for upland and 0.110 for swamp suggested that rice production in the study area could easily adjust to market conditions. The benefit-cost ratios of 1.894 and 1.433 for upland and swamp rice production respectively suggested that rice production under the two systems was profitable. Only land with estimated regression coefficient of 0.401 was found significant at 5% level in explaining the variations in the output of swamp rice while land, experience and loan having respective regression coefficients of 1563.406, 66.163 and  0.020 were significant in explaining upland rice production. Adjusted coefficients of determination (R 2) in upland and swamp rice productions were 0.612 and 0.316 respectively. Under profit maximization assumption, the linear programming analysis revealed cassava/maize/melon enterprise as the optimal farm plan in the upland system, while cocoyam/maize/cassava enterprise was the optimal farm plan in the swamp system. The solution values per hectare in the two systems were N151,613.95 and N128,412.40 respectively. When the plans were constrained to meet the minimum household food needs, the solution values were reduced to N148,710.95 and N81,927.13 respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed sole rice production to be less competitive than mixtures of other food crops (cassava, melon, maize and cocoyam) but more competitive than sole production of other food crops in the study area. In conclusion it can be said that rice production in Ogun State is flexible and can be enhanced by market incentives. Swamp rice production is more labour intensive than the upland rice production which demonstrated higher level of profitability. Labour cost, which was dominant in both systems of production was, therefore, a major determinant of profitability of rice production in the study area. On the other hand, imposition of household food requirements on the enterprises would increase the costs of production and alter the optimal production plans of the farmers.|Theses Collection|Rice production systems/upland and swamp conditions/costs and returns/food crops/labour intensive/profitability/benefit-cost ratios/coefficients of determination/farmer*||||||Okunade, Esther Omolabake|F|Participation of women local leaders in rural women-based development programmes in Osun- State, Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Agricultural Extention & Rural  Sociology|E.A.

This was explained focusing on the following dynamics: rural women-based development projects; women leadership characteristics; leaders bases of influence; leadership activities in production and processing activities; benefits of rural development projects and identified the community attitude towards women.Six rural Local Government Areas of Osun State were purposively selected for the study because of the concentration of women's groups and women development projects in the areas. They are Ife-North, Oriade, Ayedaade, Ede, Irepodun and Ifelodun LGAs. A total of 108 women local leaders and 108 women non-leaders (using simple random technique) were selected and interviewed from 18 purposively selected groups. More data were collected using focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Research instruments were duly pretested and validated, while the field work was carried out between December, 2000 and April, 2001. Data analysis involved the use of descriptive and inferential statistics (for example, frequency, percentages mean, standard deviation, bar chart, Wilcoxon sign rank test, correlation and regression analyses, ANOVA test and factor analysis).The results showed that more women leaders participated than the non-leaders at all stages of rural development projects. A total of ten leadership characteristics were found positive and significantly associated with participation. Recall (r = 0.335), humaneness (r = 0.299), communication ability (r = 0.299), consideration (r = 0.299) and competence (r = 0.262) were significant at 0.01 level, while ability to share leadership role (r = 0.240), empathy (r = 0.234), surgence (r = 0.229), literacy level (r = 0.216) and honesty (r = 0.198) were significant at 0.05 level. The following bases of influence, namely, marital status (r = 0.477), wealth (r =0.302), official position (r = 0.289) and esteem (r = 0.257) were significant at 0.01 level while popularity (r = 0.247), age (r = 0.240), ability to contribute to community development (r = 0.226) and education (r = 0.201) were significant at 0.05 level. Among women leaders at 0.05 level, positive and significant relationships were found between level of education (r = 0.228) and marital status (r = 0.210), while external orientation (r = -0.353) and occupation (r = -0.297) at 0.01 level had a negative but significant relationship with participation. Among the non-leaders at 0.05 level, positive and significant relationship were found with age (r = 0.238) and marital status (r = 0.198) while external orientation had (r = 0.262) at 0.01 level. Positive and significant differences were found in some specific activities of women local leaders. Identification of problem (F = 3.07), decision making (F = 3.05), project implementation (F = 2.89) and participation in discussion (F =3.26) were significantly at 0.05 level while project planning (F = 16.06), arrangement of meeting (F = 10.12) contribution of resource (F = 26.42)-L marketing (F = 5.90) were significant at 0.01 level.Regression results showed that literacy level (b = 1.115), surgency (b = 1.019), humaneness (b = 1.012), official position (b = 3.289), humility (b = 0.550), esteem (b = 1.2458), wealth (b = 1.054), level of education (b = 2.935) and external orientation (b = 1.758) were the determinants of participation in women based rural development projects.It is concluded that the participation of local leaders in rural women-based development projects is greatly influenced by the following factors: leadership characteristics, high personality tendencies, social interaction benefits, leadership roles, communication, leadership reliability, leadership interaction, high level of intelligence, group management, accessibility and social recognition.|Theses Collection|Leadership roles/rural development projects/rural women/leadership characteristics/communication ability/literacy level/honesty/occupation/marital status/social interaction benefits/high level of intelligence*||||||Ajayi, Adedayo Olufemi|M|Participation of rural children in farming activities in Oyo-State, Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Agricultural Extention & Rural Sociology|A.A.

It specifically identified the farming activities carried out by children, determined their levels of participation in farming activities, and their attitude to farming, assessed children's level of knowledge of the hazards associated with farming activities and safety wears available and used, compared the variations in children's farming activities in the zones studied and ascertained the indigenous equivalence of child abuse as affected by the level of literacy.Validated structured interview schedule was used to collect data from four hundred and fifty-eight children aged between six and eighteen years in the four zones within the study area, which covered twelve randomly selected communities. Qualitative data were collected in focus group discussions to reveal the communities' understanding of child labour and child abuse in a bid to finding points of agreement or deviation from international definitions.Results of the study showed that children in rural areas participate in farming while participation levels varied with farming operations. Grain planting, weeding, maize harvesting and livestock feeding ranked high while tree uprooting, chemical spraying and treatment of sick livestock ranked low among operations in which children participated. Positive and significant correlations existed between children's participation and some household variables such as reasons for farm production (r = 0.375), number of non family farm, labour available (r = 0.366) and operations in which labour shortage was experienced (r = 0.335). Ownership of crop farm had a strong and significant association with participation in farming (Chi-square x2= 63.651: Contingency Coefficient ( C = 0.349). The personal variables, which had positive and significant correlation with participation were duration of labour use (r = 0.450), age (r = 0.340), knowledge of hazards (r = 0.315), but order of child birth correlated but negatively (r = - 0.220). Ownership of personal farm had strong and significant relationship with participation level (x2 = 77.943, C = 0.3813). Participation of rural children in farming was acceptable to both literate and non-literate parents and was regarded as a means of socialization rather than child abuse.Ten family-related factors were isolated as having significant relationship with children's participation in farming activities, with each having variance or eigenvalue (E) greater than 1. The factors were family farm characteristics (E = 4.220), labour need on family farm (E = 2.816), household composition (E = 2.654), experience and farm size (E = 2.064), parents' grip on child's decision (E = 1.708), cropping system practised (E = 1.616), transport facility (E = 1.419), exposure to extension education (E = 1.295), ownership of farm (E = 1.224) and access to information (E = 1.636). The twelve personal and socio-economic factors identified were: ownership of personal farm (E = 6.491), exposure to formal education (E = 3.466), attitude towards farming (E = 2.135) family orientation (E = 1.778), farming experience (E =1.629), peer activities (E = 1.563), safety status (E = 1.476), mode of living (E = 1.353), future job aspiration (E = 1.209), availability of non-farming economic activities (E = 1.128), external influence on decision (E = 1.048) and financial support or assistance (E = 1.010).The study concluded that participation of children in farming activities was a socialisation process. Most of the children showed indifferent attitude towards farming and they also have little knowledge of hazards associated with farming and non-use of safety wears.|Theses Collection|Rural children/farming/harzards/child abuse/level of literacy/child labour/livestock/child birth/weeding/harvesting  *||||||Adewusi, Adebusuyi Rotimi|M|Vision and Art in Niyi Osundare's  The Eye of The Earth and Village Voices and Okot P'Bitek's Song of Lawino and Song of Ocol||||||M.A. Literature-in -English|Chima Anyadike||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, English|2002|||OAU|||||ix,144p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The thesis explored the similarities in the vision and arts of the poets in their volumes under the present study through which it was revealed that both poets represent the best in the "'alternative" tradition in modern African poetry.The methodology adopted was a detailed literature review of relevant available critical works on Niyi Osundare and Okot p' Bitek, a close textual analysis of selected texts and a selective reliance on biographical data on Osundare and p' Bitek through the interviews they granted.The study revealed that both poets sought to project Africaness in their poetry but for different reasons. Niyi Osundare's interest in projecting the flora and fauna of his native Ikere land in The eye of the earth and boisterous social life in Village Voices stemmed from his desire to highlight mainly his Marxist socialist's rending of the African social space.Okot p' Biket's projection of Africanness in his volumes, especially in Song of Lawino is to restate his belief in the validity of the African culture and tradition The study also revealed some areas of differences in their visions and arts.The thesis concluded that there were numerous areas of similarities but it also emphasized some fundamental differences in their visions and arts.|Theses Collection|Vision and art of poets/Niyi Osundare's The Eye of the Earth/African poetry/Marxist socialist's/Okot p' Biket's Song of Lawino/African culture and tradition *||||||Musa, Nofiu Abiodun|M|Analysis of intervention strategies for the rehabilitation of tertiary educational institution buildings in south-western, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The principal objective was to identify and assess the suitability of the adopted strategies in improving the standard of fitness of the rehabilitated buildings.In order to achieve the principal objective of the thesis, the study evaluated the performance of the adopted strategies in terms of standard of fitness on forty-eight (48) recently rehabilitated buildings in the study area. The rehabilitation works were coordinated by the Petroleum (Special) Trust Fund. The study employed the use of questionnaire and oral interviews to collect relevant data on the rehabilitated buildings in selected Federal Universities and Polytechnics in the study area. A total of seventy-two (72) questionnaires were administered. Twenty ( 20) were administered on Architects, eighteen (18) on Quantity Surveyors and thirty-four (34) were administered on Builders/Engineers, in both selected Educational Institutions and consulting firms that took part in the rehabilitation works. Out of these, forty-eight (48) were duly completed and analysed. In addition, oral interviews were conducted with some respondents to complement the information collected through the use of questionnaire. Simple percentage, Relative Significance Index and Subjective Ranking Order were used to analyse the data. The student's t-test at ninety-five percent (95%) confidence level was employed to test the significant difference between the standard of fitness of the buildings prior to and the rehabilitation exercise.The result of the analysis revealed that only short-term strategy was adopted in rehabilitating all the buildings in the study area. Facility management was adopted as a long-term strategy for only ten (10), representing twenty-one percent (21%) of the rehabilitated buildings, to complement the short-term strategy , in keeping them in continuous service.The result further revealed that the buildings that were generally in poor condition of fitness prior to the rehabilitation exercise , assumed good condition of fitness after the exercise. The improvement in the condition of fitness of the buildings is significant at five ,percent (5%) level of significance.The study concluded that the short-term strategy adopted in rehabilitating the building is suitable and has adequately curbed active deterioration in the buildings.|Theses Collection|Rehabilitation/educational institution/buildings/rehabilitated buildings/Petroleum (Special) Trust Fund/Architects/Quantity Surveyors *||||||Olorunsomo, Adeniyi Temitope|M|Gender myths in selected works of AMA ATA AIDOO||||||M.A. Literature-in-English|M.E.M.

It examined the circumstances that made them what they are, how they react to those environmental stimuli an the social significance of their reactions in the light of the struggle for female liberation and empowerment all over the world especially in the West, through the instrumentality of feminist struggles. This is looked into vis-à-vis African women's continual dissociation from feminism as practiced in the West and the consequent ideological turn-around by African women to fashion out the epistemological tools for women s emancipation in Africa. Womanism, as both the ideological and literary thrusts, offers itself for the struggle.  Thus, African Womanism divorced itself from mainstream Western feminism to make it more accommodating to African culture.This study then traces how Ama Ata Aidoo tried to embody her vision of the role of women in societal growth and health, her vision of the pivotal role of womanhood is given expression in the works selected.Hence, Anowa, Eulalie and Esi Sekyi are idioms of different predilections of women's misunderstood roles in the struggle for a just society where there will be no inequality either perceived or real.

Hence, this study was designed to screen for some bacterial species that are indigenous to the Nigerian Niger delta, with propensity for hydrocarbon degradation capabilities and to assess their potentials for use in the bioremediation of crude oil contaminated systems.Thirty crude oil utilizing bacteria were isolated from five crude oil flow stations, saver pits aqueous effluents by enrichment using Bonny light crude oil as the sole source of carbon and energy in shake flasks. Some of the isolates obtained were further screened for their ability to utilize heavy crude oil. The kinetics of utilization of the heavy crude oil by these selected bacterial isolates was monitored, while the ability to tolerate high concentration of oil was also assessed. Cell biomass (determined by viable count method), pH and residual crude oil (determined by gravimetric and gas chromatographic methods) were the major parameters used in these evaluations. Other parameters considered included utilization of some polyaromatic hydrocarbon substrates, antibiotic susceptibility profiles, possession of hydrocarbon degradation genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as well as the presence of plasmid DNAs of the isolates. The isolates were identified using both biochemical/enzymatic methods as well as 16S rDNA fingerprinting.Four bacterial isolates with promising potential for crude oil degradation were eventually selected. Specific growth rates of the bacterial isolates varied from 0.017 to 0.036 hour-', and growth peaked variously at different concentrations of crude oil. The amount of crude oil utilized in a batch culture by the isolates varied significantly from 4.3 to 46.4 mg, and increased with increasing concentration of oil. Oil degradation rate was observed to range from 0.0045 to 0.0095 day-' and was more pronounced at concentration range of 0.4 to 0.6% (w/v). The isolates generally tolerated high concentrations of heavy crude oil up to 8% (w/v), caused the reduction of the non-asphalthenic fractions of the oil by between 78 and 89%.In a simulated contamination of soil system with Bonny light crude oil, the specific growth rates of the axenic cultures ranged from 0.015 to 0.028 hour-', while degradation rates varied from 0.049 to 0.351 day-1, and amount of oil metabolized ranged from 8.6 to 29.6% during the fifteen days incubation period. Three of the four selected bacterial isolates harboured plasmid DNAs of about 13.5 Kilobase pair size and with sites for the restriction endonuclease Not 1. All the isolates showed multiple antibiotic resistances to at least 10 antibiotics. Identification procedures using biochemical/enzymatic assay identified the isolates as strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (OK1 and MT1), Burkholderia cepacia (RQ1) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (T2), while 16SrRNA profiling suggested that the four isolates are strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In conclusion, the findings of this investigation showed that the four bacterial isolates have promising potential for use in bioremediation of crude oil polluted systems.|Theses Collection|Bacterial/bioremediation/petroleum hydrocarbon/oil exploration/pollution/physicochemical  method/Nigerian Niger delta/hydrocarbon degradation/crude oil/oil flow stations/Bonny light crude oil/cell biomass/gas chromatography/polyaromatic hydrocarbon substrates/Pseudomonas aeruginosa   *||||||Amusa, Kazeem Olusola|M|A critical analysis of the African mode of juristic thought and the lessons it has for mainstream western jurisprudence. ||||||M.Phil Law|A.O.

The study compared and contrasted the African mode of juristic thought with the English common law system on selected substantive and procedural aspects of the laws on marriage, crime, land, political process, commercial transactions, administration of justice, evidence, principles of natural justice and equitable principles.Vital information were obtained from records of customary courts, judicial decisions, legislation, journals, textbooks by local and foreign authors and newspaper reports.The study revealed that contrary to the notion prevalent among some Western legal writers that Africans had no law or, if they ever had such law, that it was a bundle of primitive and barbaric norms. Africans indeed had their own system of juristic thought. The study further revealed that African juristic thought consisted of a network of well-articulated principles, ideas and ideals that had been passed down from generation to generation. These principles and ideas appeared in the garb of folklores, proverbs, maxims, taboos and other customary norms. While there might be slight variations in the African juristic thought from one community to the other, there were in substance, striking similarities.The study further showed that in the African legal system, reconciliation of the parties was promoted, compensation was paid in criminal matters, individualisation of punishment for crime rather than generalisation of punishment was encouraged, silence of an accused was not permitted, emphasis was not placed on the use of technicalities in judicial proceedings and the court process was less expensive and less cumbersome. All these were now being adopted by common law countries outside Africa. The study concluded that if law must play its role in the society or have any relevance, it must mirror the ethos, values and yearnings of the people.|Theses Collection|African juristic thought/Western jurisprudence/marriage/crime/politics/legislation/folklores/taboos/customs/proverbs *||||||Owolabi, Adekunle Adedeji|M|A comparative analysis of the legal position of an infant under the Nigerian family law||||||M.Phil Law|D.A.

The data used were obtained from mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni in the laboratory and then exposed to the plant extracts and a known drug, praziquantel, as control. The experimental plans consisted of two sets (El and E2) of experiments in which variable numbers of mice were used.The main objectives of the work are to examine the effects of the plant extracts, in comparison with the control, on the eggs of the schistosome in the liver and intestine of the experimentally infected mice; examine whether the distribution of eggs between the liver and intestine is proportional to their relative weights; observe parasite mortality after drug treatment and formulate a model for experimental chemotherapy problems.Statistical analyses such as experimental design techniques for fixed treatments, sample survey techniques for ratio estimates, multivariate regression techniques and multivariate covariance techniques of egg-load per worm pair (male and female) with weight of organs as concomitant variables were used. Numerical examples were given to illustrate each of these techniques on the experiments. The Statistical Packages for Social Scientists (SPSS) and Matrix of Laboratory (MATLAB) were the softwares used.The results showed that multivariate covariance model could be used for related chemotherapeutic problems of selected plant extracts and praziquantel on organs of mammals after appropriate transformations on the data. With respect to the plant extracts and praziquantel, praziquantel was confirmed to be an excellent drug in the sense that its administration led to the highest parasite mortality.

Also, the performance of scavenging chickens in the settlements was studied over eight weeks. Performance parameters observed were weekly body weights (g), average daily body weight gain (g/day), hen-day egg production (%), egg weight (g), hatchability (%), and chick survivability (%). Predictors of SFRB measured or determined were quantity of household leftovers (kg/day), vegetation cover (stands/m2), number of refuse heaps, and quantity of insects (active insects/m2/day). Data was collected on family poultry flock composition and management practice using structured questionnaires. Household leftovers and crop contents of scavenging chickens were analysed for proximate compositions. Data on performance and productivity were analysed using two-way analysis of variance, the quantity of SFRB were correlated with data on productivity using correlation, while the SFRB prediction equation was generated by the multiple regression analysis of the SFRB predictors. The data on family flock composition and management were analysis using simple comparative analysis such as percentage, mean and ranges. All statistical analyses were done using SAS 1997 procedures.On the average, 55.2% of the respondents kept chicken with the highest number of those keeping chicken in YK (62.8%) and the lowest in P1 (50.0%). The average flock size was 16, but flock size was highest in MR (17.8) and lowest in P2 (13.6). The quantity of household leftovers was lowest in MR (0.048 kg/day) and highest in YK (0.175 kg/day). The average SFRB estimated by measurement was 115 kg/family flock/year, the quantity ranges from 155.96 kg/family flock/year in YK to 44.2 kg/family flock/year in MR. The average quantity of SFRB determined by calculation was 195.5 kg/family flock/year. On the bird unit (B) basis, average SFRB was estimated at 8.52 kg/B/year. It was highest in YK (11.7 kg/B/year), and lowest in MR (3.03 kg/B/year).The materials isolated from the crop content of chickens were similar across the study areas and reflected the farming activities of the people there. The crop content of chicken in MR was the poorest in nutritive value, having the lowest crude protein (6.9%) and highest crude fibre (8.7%).The average number of refuse heaps was 16 in the settlements. Vegetation cover was on the average 106 stands/m2. Ipetumodu 1 had the lowest insect catch of 37 active insects/m2/day, while YK had the highest 68 active insects/m2/day, the average catch was 55 active insects/m2/day. The use of vegetation cover as increased the standard error of the regression coefficient. The average quantity of SFRB determined the by prediction equation was 113.4 kg/year. There was no significant difference in the performance of scavenging chickens in the study areas during the eight weeks of study. The only exception was chicks' survivability of chicks, which was significantly higher (p<_0.05) in P2 (87.6%), than P 1 (56.7%).The study concluded that the SFRB in the four areas studied was not sufficient for optimum performance of the chickens in the settlements.

It also considered strategies and measures aimed at remedying these problems.The study relied principally and essentially on primary and secondary sources of information. The primary sources consisted of judicial decisions, records of proceedings of superior courts or records, constitutional and statutory provisions, international conventions and newspaper reports. The secondary sources were journal articles, monographs, conference and seminar papers and textbooks. Data obtained from these sources were supplemented with information derived from interactions with legal practitioners as well as court bailiffs.The study revealed that the fruits of litigation and proved elusive to successful litigants due to the intricacies, technicalities and complexities of the law of execution of judgement. These intricacies, technicalities and complexities had rendered the processes incomprehensible to the bailiffs and consequently difficult for them to administer. Legal practitioners were also not exempted from the problem as their handling of judgement enforcement processes in some cases have worked to the detriment of their clients.It was further revealed that governments' blatant disobedience to court orders and disrespect of court judgements, particularly under prolonged military rule in Nigeria, constitute one of the greatest problems in this area of the judicial process.The study concluded that litigants would continue to find the fruit of litigations elusive until court bailiffs were properly tutored on the intricate processes of judgement enforcement and governments at various levels showed ready inclination to obey court orders and judgements.|Theses Collection|Nigerian law/legal problems/judgement enforcement/judicial process/constitutional and statutory provisions/international conventions/legal practitioners/court bailiffs/litigation/court orders*||||||Isifeh-Okpokwu, Augusta Onisokumen|F|Conflict management in selected higher educational institutions in Niger State||||||M.Sc Public Administration|E.J.

The study was considered necessary because of the urgent need to find solution to the frequent cases of mismanaged conflicts situations in these institutions.Both primary and secondary sources of data were utilized for the study. The primary data were collected through structured questionnaire and oral interviews. A total of one thousand (1,000) questionnaires were distributed to both staff and students of the two institutions and seven hundred and eighty eight (788) questionnaires were returned. Thirteen management staff from both institutions were interviewed orally while the focus group discussion was used to elicit information from the students. The secondary data were collected from official documents and relevant library materials. Simple statistical techniques like percentages and Chi-square test were used in analysing the data.The study revealed that conflict in an institution is inevitable and that its existence is not an indication of bad management. Different approaches were adopted in preventing conflict situations from degenerating into crisis situation in the institutions. These approaches include the frequent closure of the institution; the dissolution of Students Union Government (SUG) and the use of dialogue. On the use of dialogue, the study further discovered that decisions reached at most dialogues were usually not implemented. The study identified the fact that the provisions of adequate basic amenities were not the main solutions to conflict situations in the institutions. It further revealed that the managements of the two institutions have not considered it necessary to investigate the actual cause(s) of the frequent crisis situations in the institutions for the past five years. The study concluded that dialogue must be adopted in the management of conflict and the decisions reached in the dialogue must be implemented accordingly. The frequent closure of school and the dissolution of Student Union Government often adopted in managing conflicts should be reconsidered because of the effect(s) they have on the institution in general and the individual students in particular. Serious attention should be given to the calibre of students elected into the Students Union Government (SUG). The management of the institutions should investigate the remote/immediate cause(s) of the frequent conflict situations in the institutions, and find lasting solutions to them.|Theses Collection|Conflict management/Higher Educational Institutions/bad management/Students Union Government/adequate basic amenities/dialogue/Niger State *||||||Asonugho, Charles|M|Soil and leafy vegetable contamination with heavy metals associated with commercial phosphate fertilisr application||||||M.Sc.

A greenhouse study was therefore carried out to assess the level of heavy metal concentration in the soil as a result of single superphosphate application and to determine the uptake of cadmium, lead and mercury (heavy metals) and compare this with uptake of phosphorus by the two leafy vegetables:- Amarantus hybridus and Corchorus olitorius.The experimental soil was collected from a forest that has been under 30years fallow. Each plant species was treated with four levels of fertilizer (0g, 5g, 10g and 20g). Eight weeks after planting, both plant species were harvested and both plants and soil samples were analysed for cadmium, lead and mercury using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer while phosphorus was determined colorimetrically.The results showed significantly higher level of heavy metals and phosphorus in the soils and plants that received different doses of the fertilizer. The average soil content of cadium,lead, mercury and phosphorus increased significantly from 1.74, 43.08,70.77 and 56.4uge -1 of soil in unfertilised soil to 2.04, 56.61, 110.66 and 793.3ugg-1 respectively in fertilised soils.

The study specifically identified and described the different types and characteristics of women's associations; isolated the major sources and kinds of rural development projects and determined the levels, stages and forms of participation of women's associations in the rural development projects in which they participated. It also identified the associational, community and project related factors influencing, as well as the major constraints to the participation of women's associations in rural development projects.Separate structured interview schedules were employed to elicit quantitative information from 60 selected women's associations and 120 leaders. Qualitative information was gathered through Focus Group Discussions and unstructured interviews conducted for six groups of women's association and six Community Development Officers respectively. The data collected were analysed through the use of simple descriptive statistical tools including frequency and percentage distributions, while appropriate inferential statistical tools, namely linear multiple regression analysis, correlation analysis, t-test and curve-fit analysis, were employed to determine the relationship between the dependent and independent variables of the study.It was found that the socio-economic type of associations was very common (67.9%) among women in the area of study. Majority of the rural development projects in which women's associations participated were internally initiated (92.1 %), and welfare in kind (69.6%). The decision making system (r = 0.26), availability of reward for active members and officers (r = 0.27), and sources of finance (r = 0.35) were significantly related to the participation of women's associations rural development projects.The results of linear multiple regression analysis showed significant relationship between selected characteristics of the women's associations' leaders namely number of children assisting (T =3.48), position among husband's wives (T 2.52), number of years spent in acquiring formal education (T 2.47), identification with the community (T =2.40) and the participation of women's associations in rural developments projects.  Also, positive and significant correlations were found between selected characteristics of rural development projects initiated from outside the communities, namely mode of joining (r = 0.52), means of information dissemination (r = 0.50), criteria for assigning duties (r = 0.64) and participation of women's associations in rural development projects. There was a significant difference (t = - 5.99) between the participation of women's associations in rural development projects initiated from within and outside the communities, and between formal and informal women's associations (t = 0.69). Problems of finance (T = - 2.38) and tribalism (T = - 2.40) were significantly related to the participation of women's associations in rural development projects. Significant relationship was also found between community factors such as recognition of active associations (T = 2.12) and participation of women's associations in rural development projects. Similarly, the curve fit analysis of the relationship between the selected community factors and participation of women's associations revealed that the relationship was significant (F = 2.22, R2 = 0,06).  In conclusion, the participation of women's associations in rural development in the area of study was average with a mean of about three projects.

Obafemi Awolowo University Ile-Ife were investigated from December 1998 to October 1999 covering both the rainy season and dry season of the annual cycle. It is the first known work on the macro-invertebrate fauna of the reservoir. The major objective of this study was to provide baseline information on aspects of the biology (taxonomic composition, occurrence, distribution and abundance) of the benthic macro-invertebrate animals of the reservoir and how the fauna is influenced by the physico-chemical parameters of the bottom sediments.The reservoir was divided into three sections (deep, mid-basin and the shallow sections) along its main axis as well as into the littoral and profoundal regions along its width for the purpose of sampling design and selection of sampling stations., Sediment samples were collected on monthly basis using an Ekman grab and altogether a total of two hundred and twenty samples were collected from the twenty stations established. Samples were analysed for some pre-selected sediment physicochemical characteristics (Temperature. Textural composition, pH, Electrical conductivity), major ions (calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Alkalinity, Sulphate and Chloride), nutrients (Nitrate, Phosphorus, Silicate and Organic carbon) and heavy metals (Lead. Manganese, Zinc, Iron and Copper). Sediment samples were sieved through a 0.5mm mesh size sieve and benthic macro-invertebrate animals collected were sorted and preserved in 5% formalin.The relationship between the investigated sampling stations with regard to sediment physico- chemical characteristics and the recorded benthic macro-invertebrate animals was established using various statistical tests including descriptive statistics, linear regression analysis, correlation analysis, cluster analysis and Duncan multiple range test (using appropriate software on personal computer).Seven species of benthic macro-invertebrate fauna made up of live gastropod molluscs (Biomphalaria pfeifferi (Krauss, 1818), Bulinus globosus (Krauss.1818)), Lymnea natalensis (Krauss, 184), Lanistes lybicus (Morelet, 1848), and Potadorma moerchi (Reeve, 1859) and two larval forms of unidentified insects belonging to orders Zygoptera and Zygoptera were recorded. Species were more abundant in the deep section than the mid-basin and least at the shallow section of the reservoir. The littoral region was richest in invertebrate animals than the profoundal region, while on seasonal basis, macro-invertebrate animals were abundant In the rainy season than the dry season. The reservoir sediments were mostly sandy mud. Of all the investigated physico-chemical sediment parameters, only water depth showed significant positive correlation (P< 0.05) with the occurrence of the macro-invertebrate benthic animals collected. On the other hand, the percentage silt and clay particles were inverse significant correlation (P< 0.05) with their occurrence. Most of the parameters showed marked seasonal variation except chloride, copper and zinc.Based on the occurrence of macro-invertebrate fauna, the reservoir is considered impoverished when compared with some other lakes, reservoirs and inland waterbodies' in Nigeria and other parts of the world.|Theses Collection|Macro-invertebrate/benthic fauna/Opa reservoir/taxonomic composition/bottom sediments/Ekman grab/textural composition/pH/Electrical conductivity/alkalinity/formalin/gastropod molluscs/inland waterbodies' *||||||Obinyan, Obhiye Felix|M|Inventory and propagation strategies of some endangered indigenous leaf vegetable in south western Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

A step was also taken to propagate some endangered species of high premium identified to be endangered during the survey.The survey was conducted in twelve local government areas of three southwestern states (Osun, Ekiti and Ondo). Thirteen indigenous leaf species were identified as threatened or endangered. Two species (Crassocephalum biafrae and Launeae taraxacifolia) were selected for propagation study. Different stem cutting lengths / sizes were planted in soils treated with varying rates of poultry manure. This was done to ascertain the best method of propagation to adopt in order to ensure the continuous existence of such species and thus prevent biodiversity loss.The results showed that 10cm-cutting length was best followed by 8cm, 6cm and 4cm cutting lengths in terms of performance in both plants species. Soil treatment having 2/3 soil and 1/3 poultry manure (2/3 S + 1/3 PM) produced plants that were better than any other soil/poultry manure combination in both vegetable species. The highest yield was recorded in plants that had 10cm-cutting length planted in soil mixture of 2:1 soil/poultry manure. No plant survived the use of `whole' poultry manure (WPM) in each case of L. taraxacifolia while those of C. biafrae were heavily scotched and stunted resulting in low yield.The study concluded that C. biafrae has a better resistance to the burning effect of decomposing organic matter like poultry manure than L. taraxacifolia. in effect, the latter also had a poor response to the use of poultry manure in large quantities.|Theses Collection|Leaf vegetable/endangered species/propagation study/biodiversity loss/soil treatment/Crassocephalum biafrae/Launeae taraxacifolia/organic matter/decomposition*||||||Adeka, Saudat Oluwatoyin|F|Effects of health education on hypertensive workers at Nigerian Ports Authority, Lagos||||||M.Sc.

Hypertension remains a contemporary health problem in Nigeria today, despite the available medical management. An intervention study was carried out on Workers with Hypertension (WWH) in Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Lagos. A study sample of 80 Workers with Hypertension (WWH) in NPA, Lagos was enrolled on the experimental design for the study.The effect of the Health education programme was then assessed on the life-style, drug compliance and level of blood pressure control among these workers. The study comprised of three phases  pre-intervention, intervention and post-intervention phases. During the pre-intervention phase, all the eighty subjects were interviewed using the structured interview guide. The findings helped in the development of a health education intervention programme, which was utilized in the second phase, i.e. the intervention phase. During the intervention phase, systematic sampling technique was used in allocating the 80 subjects into either intervention group (Group `A') or the control group (Group `B'). Each group was made of 40 subjects. The health education programme was then administered to the intervention group only. In the evaluation phase, the structured interview guide was re-administered to the subjects in the control and the intervention groups. Data generated were then analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical techniques like percentages, bar charts, chi-squares and T-test. The results showed the subjects in the intervention group had significantly better understanding of - the meaning of hypertension (78%) compared with 2.5% of the control group (÷2-46.9; P < 0.05); its risk factors (98% compared with 62% of the control group (÷2- 32.6; P < 0.05) and the complication 90% compared with 55% of the control group (÷ 2-12.3; P < 0.05. Also, subjects in the intervention group had a higher level of drug compliance (87.5%) compared with subjects in the control group 27.5% (÷ 2-29.5; P < 0.05). Subjects in the intervention group had a significant relevant life-style modification than the control group. For instance, up to 62.5% of the control subjects still indulged in alcohol consumption compared with 12.5% of the intervention group (÷2-21.3; P < 0.05). Subjects in the intervention group had their blood pressure better controlled than the subjects in the control group. For example, the mean systolic and diastolic values for the intervention group was (123/79 mmHg while the mean systolic and diastolic values for the control group was 158/106 mmHg. In conclusion, the health education on hypertension had improved the knowledge of the studied subjects about their health condition such that a significant modification of their life  style was observed. The health education programme, therefore, proved to be an important tool in the management of hypertension.|Theses Collection|Hypertension/health education programme/blood pressure/drug compliance/alcohol consumption  *||||||Chima, Christopher Ifechukwude|M|Urban change detection from remotely sensed data of Ikeja area, Lagos||||||M.Sc.

Black and white aerial photographs of 1976 and 1987 at scales of 1: 25000 and 1: 4000 respectively and SPOT XS imagery of 1994 at a scale of 1: 50000 were used for the analysis. A "ground truthing" exercise was carried out to verify and update the data in 2000. Other supporting data like base maps of 1963 and 1983 at scales of 1: 50000 and 1: 25000 respectively were used to aid interpretation.Data were generated from the interpretation of Remote Sensing imageries. A mirror stereoscope was used to interpret and highlight land use on the aerial photographs before being mosaiced and traced unto transparencies. The SPOT XS imagery of the area was interpreted from a hard copy after radiometric enhancement. The areal extent of each land use type was estimated using graph paper method. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to test for the statistical significance of land use change.In 1976, which was the base year, the areal extent of urban development was 2720Ha. or 67.58% of the total land area, in 1987, eleven years after the area became the Lagos State Capital, urban land use covered 3750Ha. (93.17%), in 1994 it was 3980Ha. (98.88%) and by 2000 it had increased to 4013Ha. (99.70%). The results of the ANOVA showed that the changes in land use were significant over the study period (p < 0.05). The findings revealed that the magnitude and direction of change was greatly influenced by the establishment of new industrial layouts, government establishments and upsurge in the demand for residential areas. Areas originally marked out for recreational facilities gave way to urban development. The most striking of this was the area marked for stadium development, which has been converted to residential.The study showed the usefulness of Remote Sensing techniques as a tool for rapid information gathering for urban environment management purposes. Problems associated with the use of Remote Sensing imageries were also highlighted. The aerial photographs allowed for detailed land use analysis while the satellite imagery provided a better synoptic coverage useful for broad land cover mapping.|Theses Collection|Land use/land use act of 1976/SPOT XS imagery/sterescope/Remote Sensing imageries/synoptic coverage/mapping/Nigeria  *||||||Jolaoso, Janet Iyabo Kofo|F|Comparative studies on the effectiveness of disinfectants in surface cleaning in the pharmaceutical manufacturing environment||||||M.Sc.

The comparative study of disinfectant effectiveness in surface cleaning in the pharmaceutical manufacturing environment, as reported in this thesis, represents an evaluation of the degree to which various disinfectants commonly used can fulfill this role. Six different disinfectants, viz. Evant (1%), Ethanol (70%), Oxonia (1%), Benzoic acid (0.1%), Formaldehyde (0.5%) and Benzoic acid + Sodium hydroxide (20%) were used in this study.The work was done with a view to examining the effective concentration of local preparations of disinfectants in the pharmaceutical industry. The surfaces investigated included bay floor (packaging floor) and product contact parts (filling nozzles and cap arm). The bacterial load before and after the application of the disinfectants was determined by carrying out total viable counts while the identification of the individual bacterial isolate was done using standard cultural, morphological and biochemical characteristics.Prior to disinfection, high microbial loads were determined on all the surfaces. The organisms isolated included Clostridium corni, Bacillus firmus, Aspergillus sp., Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium luteum, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus brevis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter viridans and Corynebacterium sp. The application of disinfectants to these organisms using the disc diffusion method resulted in varying degrees of inhibition, as indicated by the diameters of the zones.The combination of two or more agents was also found to produce better results. For example, a combination of Dichlorohexynol and Potassium hydroxide (Evant) showed the highest activity, followed by the combination of Benzoic acid and Sodium hydroxide. Furthermore, Evant, a locally prepared disinfectant showed a higher inhibitory action on the microorganisms than any other disinfectant singly used. This disinfectant is cheaper than other imported products containing similar active ingredients.Overall, it appears that combinations of disinfectants in their use-dilutions would be more effective in enhancing cleaning in order to achieve standards that are in conformity with good manufacturing practice, when compared to using only one type of disinfectant continuously. The use of locally produced antimicrobial agents that are just as effective as the important ones could, however, be recommended to the pharmaceutical companies for reasons of their cost-effectiveness.|Theses Collection|Disinfectants/microbial contamination/infection/manufacturing environment/pharmaceutical industry/dichlorohexynol/potassium hydroxide/microorganisms/antimicrobial agents*||||||Omisore, Emmanuel Olufemi|M|Physical planning implications of consernation of historical sites in Ile-Ife||||||Ph.D. Urban & Regional Planning|L.O Olajuyin||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Urban & Regional Planning|2002|||OAU|||||xx,242p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The three main objectives of the study were to: determine the location and spatial distribution of historical sites; examine some physical planning variables that should be considered for conservation of historical sites; and investigate some constraints and prospects of conservation of such sites.The study area was divided into seven zones. A comprehensive reconnaissance survey of the area was carried out and 337 sites were identified and classified into six groups. Out of these, 189 sites were selected to form the sample size. Data were collected through the use of field surveys and questionnaires were administered on curators of the sites. Descriptive and multivariate statistics such as frequencies, correlation analysis, logit regression analysis, principal component and factor analysis were used to analyse the data collected.The study showed that historical sites were not evenly distributed but were concentrated around the centre of each of the two communities in the study area. The study revealed that 56% were used for religious purposes dating back to antiquity. Furthermore, the study showed that there was lack of maintenance of some of these sites with 47% dilapidated, unplastered and many lacking infrastructural facilities. Some of the important constraints revealed by the study include the advent of new religions and lack of government support. Some of the prospects of conserving historical sites include income generation and promotion of tourism. The study showed that the need for conservation correlated positively and strongly with the number of floors of the houses (r = 0.4862), condition of sites (r = 0.5231), availability of electricity (r = 0.5966), water (r = 0.5113) and toilet facilities (r = 0.4733). On the other hand, it had a negative and low correlation with the use of sites (r = -0.4550), age of buildings (r = -0.5361), material of construction (r = -0.3731) and access to historical sites (r = -0.3596). The study further showed that the five principal factors having eigenvalues greater than 1.0 were, need for conservation (6.981), site use (2.421), style of buildings (1.581), number of floors of buildings (1.317) and materials for construction (1.079).The physical planning implications of the findings include the immediate renovation of the dilapidated historical sites to prevent further degeneration into slum; the provision of necessary infrastructural facilities that would enhance their utilization for tourism and the collection of revenue from tourists to sustain their conservation.|Theses Collection|Physical planning/conservation of sites/historical sites/location/spatial distribution/curators/antiquity/tourism/infrastructural facilities/Ile-Ife *||||||Olanipekun, Emmanuel Abiodun|M|An appraisal of energy conservation practices in some selected buildings at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife||||||M.Sc.

The factors influencing such demand and utilization pattern were determined. In particular the use of electrical energy across different user groups including students, households and the business sector was evaluated. The perception of energy conservation methodologies was also assessed and identified.The study employed the use of questionnaire survey and personal interviews conducted on households, students, management and staff and the business sector to generate the necessary data. The sample was selected using systematic, quota and random sampling techniques. A total of 300 questionnaires were distributed to households, 450 to students, 250 management and staff and 187 to the business sector. A total of 963 usable questionnaires comprising 200 from households, 372 from students, 166 from management and staff and 125 from the business sector were returned. On-site investigations and measurements were also employed to evaluate monthly electrical consumption of ninety-two (92) households spread across fourteen (14) house types and five (5) students' hostels. The analysis of data collected was carried out using descriptive and inferential statistics.The results from the study showed that electricity, kerosene and gas were the most important sources of energy for cooking, heating, lighting and power. The use of firewood and coal were common in junior staff quarters. The study found that convenience, neatness, availability, reliability lifestyles/behaviour and educational level were the major factors implicated in the demand and utilization pattern of energy. The study revealed that energy and equipment/appliances were not efficiently and effectively utilized in the study area. The perception of users indicated that regular education and information, functionality of the equipment control systems, legislation and enforcement were some of the most important conservation tools that could stimulate consumers to use energy efficiently and effectively.The study recommended among others, that a tariff system based on consumption be introduced in the university, while the standardization of equipment and appliances should also be encouraged.|Theses Collection|Energy/energy conservation/energy demand/electrical energy/electrical consumption/sources of energy/buildings/hostels*||||||Abegunde, Albert Ayorinde|M|Regional planning effects of best oils limited on Ibadan and its hinterlands||||||M.Sc.

The objectives were to identify the social, economic and environmental effects of the industry through input acquisition and output distribution of products within Ibadan and its hinterlands. It also examined the spatial extent of its operation as well as the backwash and spread effects of the location of the industry.Primary and secondary data were collected for the study. The primary data were generated through the use of four sets of questionnaires administered on the management, employees, customers and residents living in the immediate environment of the industry. Fifty percent of the employees and 30 percent ofhousehold heads in the immediate neighbourhood where the company was located were selected using systematic random sampling. Purposive sampling technique was also used to select the 140 customers interviewed. In all, a total of 508 questionnaires were administered.The study found that distance significantly affected labour recruitment in Best Oils Limited as 63 percent of the sampled employees came from Ibadan and its immediate hinterlands. The expenditures of the staff on feeding, house rent, transportation and remittance contributed an estimated 14.6 million naira annually to economy of Ibadan region as spread effect. The findings further established that 51 percent of the palm kernels used in Best Oils Limited was tapped within Ibadan region while over 68 percent of the proceeds realised from the sales of these palm kernels were distributed within Ibadan region's economy as spread effect of the company. However, about 60 percent of buyers of output product of the industry were from outside Oyo State. The contingency coefficient of the relationship existing-between employments generated at the sources of input and that of the destinations of output product was significant at the 0.3 level. This indicates that the two variables moderately influenced each other. Nonetheless, the residents of the industrial environment confirmed the negative effect the industry has on them; noise pollution (90 percent of the respondents), burnt palm kernel odour (78 percent of the respondents) and smoke (43 percent of the respondent).The study suggested that septic tanks be provided for the industrial sewage of company while the residents could be eased of other industrial pollutions when the industry relocates to its newly acquired site which is well away from residential areas and is within an industrial estate. Similarly, more parking space and pavement of access road are to be provided. In addition, more tertiary firms that could make use of best Oils output product should be encourage to establish in Ibadan so as to block the leakage of spread effect.|Theses Collection|Regional planning effects/labour recruitment/expenditures/noise pollution *||||||Timbiri, Augustine|M|Effect of petroleum pipeline corridor on the floristic composition and physiognomy of vegetation in Yenagoa local government area of Bayelsa State||||||M.Sc.

The aim was to assess the consequences of ROW on vegetation and soil of the area.Two sites, one along the ROW and another (control) parallel to the ROW were selected for the study. In each site, a total of 20 sample plots - 25m x 25m, were established systematically at 100m-interval along a line transect. In each plot, plant species were identified to species level and tree species were completely enumerated. Tree girth at breast height, tree height, foliage cover, and overstorey and understorey crowns were measured. The data from these measurements were used to establish the species composition, and calculate the tree basal area, tree density, wood volume and species diversity of each plot. Five soil samples were randomly collected at two depths: 0-15cm (topsoil) and 15-30cm (subsoil), in each plot. The soil samples were analysed for pH, particle size distribution, organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na). Degradation indices for the vegetation and soil properties were calculated to determine the extent of their degradation along the ROW using data from the control as standard. Analysis of variance and student t-test were used to test for significant difference in the soil and vegetation properties between the sites and between topsoil and subsoil. Soil-vegetation relationship was examined using correlation coefficient analysis.The results showed that number of species and genera, tree height, tree girth, basal area, wood volume, foliage cover and Shannon-Weiner diversity in the control site were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those of the ROW. Number of family, overstorey and  understorey crown percent were significantly higher (P < 0.01) in the control than in the ROW. Soil pH was significantly lower (P< 0.001) in the control than in the ROW. Sand content was significantly higher and soil clay was lower (P < 0.05) in the control than in the ROW. Organic matter, available phosphorus and total nitrogen were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in the control than in the ROW. There were significantly higher (P < 0.001) organic matter and nitrogen contents in the topsoil than in the subsoil. There were both significant positive and negative correlations between some vegetation and soil properties in the sites. Organic matter, total nitrogen and available phosphorus were the most degraded soil properties while all vegetation parameters studied except tree density were greatly degraded along the ROW.The significant difference in the soil and vegetation properties between the ROW and control sites implied that the ROW had adversely affected the vegetation. This has consequently affected the soil properties especially those influenced by vegetation namely: organic matter, total nitrogen, and available phosphorus.|Theses Collection|Petroleum/petroleum pipeline corridor/physiognomyvegetation/degradation/exchangeable cations/topsoil/foliage cover/Shannon-Weiner diversity/Yenagoa Local Government Area/Nigerian Niger Delta *||||||Akwoga, Johnson Atama|M|Soil distribution of phosphate and nitrate in profiles under different farm management systems at IAR &T, Ibadan||||||M.Sc.

The nitrate was determined by using a Technicon AA11 automated method while phosphorus was determined by a modified Bray 1 method using Technicon AA11.Results from this study reveal that there was heterogeneity in the nitrate distribution in all the management systems. Nitrate increased (2.48 - 5.67mg NO3-N/kg Soil) with increase in soil depths in the high fertilized soil, while it decreased at low (4.48  1.54 NO3-N/kg Soil) and medium level (2.46  1.8mg NO3-N/kg Soil) fertilized soil. However in all the different farm management systems, there was an observed accumulation of nitrate at depths of 100  180cm.Phosphate, however, decreased with increase in soil depths in all the different sod management systems. This was attributed to its high absorption capacity to soil constituents, more especially clay and organic matter. The phosphate and nitrate concentrations were higher at the middle of the slope compared to the top and bottom. Phosphate and nitrate concentrations in the run-off were more affected by the positions along the slope than by soil management. Nitrate concentrations of 13.01 mgr/L, 11.27mg/L, 15.37mg/L and phosphate concentrations of 31.13mg/L, 16.10mg/L and 30.36mg/L obtained at top, middle and bottom of the slope were found to be above the WHO and FEPA standards.This research therefore suggests the need for an urgent management intervention to prevent leaching of those nutrients to underground waters and run-off to streams and lakes.|Theses Collection|Soil profile/farm management systems/phosphate/nitrate/Technicon AA11 automated method/heterogeneity/soil depths/fertilized soil/organic matter*||||||Adenowo, Thomas Kehinde Oluwafemi|M|Morphometric studies on the Pineal gland of the Pangolin Manis Tricuspis ( Rafinesque 1821)||||||P.h.D.

Following decapitation of the animal, the cranium was opened up and the pineal gland was dissected out. Histological sections were prepared and stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H and E) method of Luna (1968). Micromorphometric measurements were carried out using the methods of McGrath (1978), Mc Culloch and Melcher (1983) Pal et al (1985) and W.H.0     (1991). The Periodic Acid Schiff's method (Mcmanus, 1946; modified by Pearse (1949) was used to appraise the distribution of glycogen.The gross-anatomy of the gland in this species was observed as two horizontal be on the dorsum of the diencephalon and were interconnected by a loop of connective tissue caudally It was concluded on the basis of this observation that epiphysis cerebri is the most appropriate nomenclature for the gland. These macroscopic observations underline the primitivity of the epiphysis cerebri in the pangolin.Microscopically the gland appeared as an intact parenchymatous mass embedded in neural Stroma. The parenchyma was composed of admixture of pinealocytes with supporting glial cells namely astrocytes and pericytes. The encapsulated glandular stoma was rich in blood vessels and neural elements.The male Pangolins were significantly heavier (1 .65±0.13kg) and longer (102±0.20cm) than the females which weighed (1.30±0.09kg) and measured (100 ±0.20cm) (P>0.50).Morphometric observations showed that pineal capsular thickness exhibited no significant sexdifference (P>0.50). This was 12.77±092microns in the female and 1275±0.50microns in the male.The pinealocytes were the largest and the most abundantly distributed cell type. The nuclear diameter was 5.12±0.26microns in the female and 4.77±0.14microns in the male. The nuclei density of these cells was 0:168±0.0082 nuclei per millimetre square in the female and 0.128±0.032 nuclei per millimetre square in the male.This was followed by the astrocytes with a nuclear diameter of 3.11± 0.05 microns in the female. The density of the astrocytes was 0.095±0.0048 nuclei per millimeter square in the female and 0.083±0.007 nuclei per millimetre square in the male.The third dell type was the pericytes with a nuclear diameter o 2.07±0.05microns in the female and 2, 07±0.02microns in the male The nuclei  density of the pericytes was 0.063±0.0082 nuclei per millimeter square in the female and 0.3061±0.012 nuclei per millimeter square in the male. The nuclei densities were significantly higher in the female than in the male for the pinealocytes, astrocytes and pericytes at different levels of significance. This indicates that the pineal gland may probably play a more active role in the female reproductive and daily motor activities than in the male counterpart. However, no significant difference was observed in the nuclear diameters with respect to sex. Very little glycogen macromolecules were also demonstrated in the epiphysis ceribri of the pangolin. Based on the observed histoarchitecture which compares favourably with other mammals, it is suggested that it may subserve a comparable endocrine function as in these mammals. More detailed studies are necessary to confirm this speculation. However, the histomorphometric disparities observed in this study between the female and the male pangolins require further investigations to elucidate their implications.|Theses Collection|Morphometric studies/micro-anatomy/histochemistry/pineal gland/glycogen/pangolin/parenchyma/epiphysis cerebri/glial cells/astrocytes/pericytes *||||||Oke, Jonathan Ojo|M|The emergence, growth and impact of indigenous churches in the former Ondo province of Nigeria. 1913 -1976||||||Ph.D. History|G.O.I Olomola||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, History|2002|||OAU|||||xvi,232p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The study also examined how the issues of liturgy, festivals and Christian celebrations, among other, factors, contributed to the growth of the Indigenous Churches. It then highlighted how the Indigenous Churches impacted on the people of the former Ondo Province.Although this work is written for an audience whose discipline is history, there is evidence in the body of the work of reliance on the work of scholars other than historians. This is not simply a matter of necessity, but also of choice. History needs to be related closely to other disciplines, especially to the social sciences inasmuch as both historians and social scientists are involved in studying social stability and social change and their methodology to these subjects has much in common.This study has shown that Christianity has always triumphed where it has been indigenized by adherents. The African Church of Nigeria seceded from the orthodox Anglican Church in opposition to European control. The thesis spotlighted other circumstances which led to the rise of the African Church. The Cherubim and Seraphim Church and the Christ Apostolic Church emerged with emphasis on prophetic symbolism. While they ruthlessly mounted crusades against the practices and contents of traditional religions like charms and the ifa oracular geomantic operation for deciphering the future, they provided comparatively satisfying substitutes in prophetic and symbolic forms. Some of the phenomenal features of the prophetic Churches include the medium on revelation, and the mediatory and revelatory functions of both the Holy Spirit and Angels. It seems the prophets in the independent Indigenous Churches emerged to dislodge the old traditional priesthood which they found in place. Besides, the Indigenous Churches' emphasis on evangelism, revival Services and enthusiastic devotion to winning converts also contributed to their growth.The thesis revealed that the Indigenous Churches' special premium on prayers and intercession had a lasting impact on their adherents. Equally fascinating and revealing was the issue of the Indigenous Churches' adepts spiritual interpretations of incidents and events comparable to the traditional concepts of predestination which also had an impact on their members and inquirers. The study also showed how instances of miracles and cura divina which are part of the distinctive marks of Indigenous Churches, and the C.A.C. in particular, had great impact on the C.A.C. adherents and the general public. The issue of syncretism or parallelism, which was one of' the features of Indigenous Churches, and especially with the Cherubim and Seraphim Church, had its impact on the C. and S. Church during the period under study.In conclusion, the thesis spotlighted the positive contributions of Indigenous Churches which included educational development, and commitment to make the gospel of Jesus Christ more relevant and meaningful to the lives of Christians. These positive trends served as guarantee for their continued existence, in spite or noticeable weaknesses such as schisms or formation of splinter groups, laxity in Church discipline and syncretism, which is an instance of extra-biblical practice.|Theses Collection|Christianity/liturgy/festivals/christian celebrations/orthodost churches/traditional religions/prophesy/revelation/Holy Spirit/Angels/indigenous Churches*||||||Ogunjimi, Sunday Idowu|M|Operational habits and health hazards in the use of agro-chemicals among cocoa farmers in Osun  and Edo State||||||M.Sc.

Descriptive statistics was used to analyse the data, while correlation coefficient and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were used to test the hypotheses.The results showed a high risk of farmers' exposure to chemical toxicity because of the hazardous nature of the chemicals and the careless way of handling them by cocoa farmers in the two States. The agro-chemicals used by the farmers include cuprous oxide (Perenox), cerbendazin (Ridomil), bordeaux mixtures (Copper sulphate), benzene hexachloride (Gamalin 20), diazinon (Basudin) and lindane (Kokotine). The level of knowledge of precautionary measures in both States was low but Osun State farmers (mean of 2.8) were more knowledgeable than Edo State farmers (mean of 1.9). Most of the farmers in the two States were in the habit of eating (61.7% and 68.3%), drinking (75.0% and 75.8%) and smoking (51.7% and 59.2%) during chemical application. As many as 54.2% of cocoa farmers in Osun State and 68.3% in Edo State stored their chemicals in their living room together with food stuff, while 60.8% of cocoa farmers in Osun State and 71.7% in Edo State re-used empty chemical containers. About 65.0% and 68.0% had no proper training on safe handling of chemicals in Osun and Edo States, respectively. The major source of information about agro-chemicals and precautionary measures in the two States was experience gained from other farmers.  Majority of cocoa farmers in the two States claimed that they had one health problem or the other which often occurred after using chemicals.Results of the ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference in knowledge of precautionary measures in the use of chemicals between cocoa farmers in Osun and Edo States at p < 0.05. Furthermore, there were significant differences in farm size, annual income, farmers' external orientation and extension contact between cocoa farmers in Osun and Edo States at p.< 0.05..In conclusion, there was a lower level of knowledge of precautionary measures in the use of chemicals among cocoa farmers in Edo State than Osun State.|Theses Collection|Operational habits/health hazards/agro-chemicals/cocoa farmers/chemical toxicity/benzene hexachloride/literacy level/cerbendazin  *||||||Kolawole, Oluwatoyin Dare|M|Factors associated with the utilization of indigenous knowledge systems for soil fertility conservation by farmers in Ekiti State, Nigeria||||||P.h.D.

It specifically evaluated the average IKS utilization  of farmers; identified various IKS utilized in conserving soil fertility and why they were utilized; identified and analysed farmer's socio-economic and community-related factors associated with IKS utilization.The study was conducted using a multi-stage sampling technique to select 250 farmers in 20 communities drawn from all the five divisions in the !ate namely: Ekiti North, Ekiti West, Ekiti East, Ekiti South and Ekiti Central. structured interview schedule was used to collect information from the respondents.	Frequency distribution, percentages, mean, and standard deviation were used to describe the data. Correlation and regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses formulated. Factor and principal component analyses were also used to isolate the crucial factors associated with the utilization of IKS in soil fertility conservation.The results showed that the IKS utilization score of farmers was below average. Inferential statistics, however, indicated that at both p< 0.01 and .05 levels of significance, there was a positive and significant correlation  between IKS utilization and farmer related factors such as age (r =0.260), family size (r =0.289), religion           (r =0.132), farm size ( 0.180), income level (r =0.252), and IKS characteristics such as openness (r =0.933),communication (r =0.949), cost-profitability (r =0.559), relative advantage (r =0.613), result -effectiveness (r =0.599),activeness (r = 0.734), and user-friendliness (r = 0.886). Others are community-related factors such as cultural pattern (r = 0.128), presence of agriculturally oriented people (r = 0.183), and institutional factors such as research-extension roles (r = 0.148), and government policy issues          (r = .236). There also existed a positive and strong association between IKS utilization and association membership (t = 1.769), and farming scope (t = 3.741).Conversely, a negative but significant correlation existed between IKS utilization and level of education (r = -0.177), vegetation (r = -0.409), and people's attitudes (r = -0.336). Ten groups of crucial factors that had strong association with the utilization of IKS were isolated. The basis for their isolation was that they all had high contributing loading factors (L) and latent root (X) greater than 1.

The serological techniques known as Widal test is the most common method employed in diagnosing the disease. The study was carried out to determine the incidence of salmonellae species from faecal specimens of patients using Widal test, characterize the salmonellae isolates, determine the antibiotic resistance profile of the isolates to some of the most frequently used antibiotics and investigate whether the antibiotic resistances encountered were transferable to plasmidless organism (E. Coli C600).Faecal samples were taken from 154 individuals who tested positive to the Widal test, between October 1995 and February 1996, at Our Lady of Lourdes Maternity and Clinic, Ipetumodu, Southwestern Nigeria. Samples were cultured on MacConkey, Eosine Methylene Blue, Deoxychoalate Citrate, and Brilliant Green media for preliminary isolation. Isolates were identified based on cultural, morphological, and biochemical characteristics. The in vitro antibiotic susceptibility patterns of some of the isolates were determined by disc diffusion method. Transconjugation of the antibiotic resistance transfer of some of the isolates were also determined.A total of two hundred and forty-seven Enterobacteriaceae were recovered from the faecal samples. Twenty-five(10.12%) of these were salmonellae species. S. typhimurium isolates were the most predominant (3.64%), followed by Salmonella arizonae (2.83%), S. typhi, S. paratyphi A and S. choleraesuis were (1.21%) each.Widespread resistance to the antibiotics was recorded amongst the isolates in the community. The most common pattern of resistance involved resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, trimethoprim, sulphanomide, and chloramphenicol. Altogether, resistance to ampicillin was 64%, chloramphenicol (32%), Co-trimoxazole (60%) and tetracycline (84%). Approximately, 87% of the Salmonella  spp. were able to transfer their resistances to plasmidless strains, while 62% were said to be highly resistant.The study suggested that Widal positivity is not a reliable criterion for diagnosing Typhoid Fever (TF) within the study environment. It also suggested that the ability to distinguish accurately and rapidly from non-typhoidal salmonellae should be valuable for distinguishing TF caused by S.typhi and enteric fevers caused by other salmonellae. The study also highlighted the prevalence of multiply resistance salmonellae isolates among Widal positive subjects and the epidemiological significance in the control of these infectious agents.|Theses Collection|Salmonella typhi/serology/bacteriology/widal test/plasmidless organism/MacConkey/Eosine Methylene Blue/Deoxychoalate Citrate/Transconjugation/ampicillin/chloramphenicol/Co-trimoxazole *||||||Fayokun, Kayode Olatunbosun|M|Problems of plurality of law: a critical appraisal of the Nigerian legal system||||||M.Phil Law|D.A.

Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ Zn2+ and Pb2+ were determined using the AAS at their characteristic wavelengths of 589ìm, 764ìm, 422µm, 285µm, 214µm and 238µm, respectively. The biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) was determined after five days incubation in the dark using the same method for DO. Cl- was determined by the argentiometric titration method and N03-, SO4 2-, and PO43- by the colometric method at 410ìm, 420ìm and 660ìm wavelengths, respectively. The relationship in the properties of the stream-borne effluent from Oja-Titun market and the receiving water bodies was determined using graphs and Pearson moment product correlation coefficient.The results obtained; water temperature (27.5±2.4-31.5±1.3°C), pH (5.5±0.3-8.0±0.4), electrical conductivity (209.5±165.5-620.0±188.3µS/cm), DO (3.5±0.5  8.2±2.6mg/l), BOD5 (4.3±0.9 - 10.8±5.3mg/l), Ca`+ (51.2±24.1-93.2±3.0mg/l),  Mg2+(58.2±26.3  100.3±4.1mg/1), K+(52.6±25.2-112.0±7.5mg/l), Na+(52.5±24.0  103.0±22.3mg/1). Cl- (76.8±75.8- 279.5±37.6mg/1), NO3- (0.06±0.02-0.13± 0.07mg/l) showed that while the mean values of these parameters fall within the acceptable limitation guidelines of FEPA and WHO, the levels of PO43- (11.5±6.9mg/I  82.2±13.2mg/1), Pb2+ (0.10±0.01  0.19±0.04mg/I), Zn2+ (1.5±0.5  4.6±0.4mg/1) and SO42- (94.2±18.5-239.6±257.5mg/1) were higher than either the FEPA or WHO recommended limits. Also, there was a pronounced seasonal variation in all the parameters investigated in all the receiving water bodies and the downstream trend of most parameters suggested non-point sources of pollutants along the river channel. Strong positive inter-relationships were also established among the stream-borne effluent from Oja-Titun market, tributary streams and Opa River and Reservoir for most of the parameters investigated, except NO3-, PO43- and electrical conductivity.The study concluded that the market stream-borne effluent has a significant influence on the properties of the receiving water bodies.|Theses Collection|Spatio-seasonal distribution/physicochemical properties/freshwater bodies/Ile-Ife/mercury-inglass thermometer/pH/conductivity meter/dissolved oxygen meter/ wavelengths/biochemical oxygen demand/argentiometric titration method/colometric method/stream-borne effluent   *||||||Akanbi, Solomon Olusola|M|The impact of pentecostalism on Lagos Anglican Diocese from 1988 -1998||||||M.A  Religious Studies|D.O.

This was during the arch-episcopacy of the Most Reverend Abiodun Adetiloye, the Primate and Metropolitan and Head of all Anglican Churches in Nigeria and the then Bishop of Lagos. Originally, the high-churchmanship form of worship brought as the evangelism package by the Church Missionary Society (CMS) did not recognize Pentecostalism in its liturgy. Indeed, at that early stage of the Church in Nigeria, Pentecostalism was `foreign' in the Anglican Church liturgy. This was why the liturgy was in stereotyped and rigid forms. The work therefore traced the changes, identified and analysed the change agents, Pentecostal activities and their impact on Anglican Diocese of Lagos.The research methodology adopted was polyvalent. First, for the theoretical frame-work, a phenomenological approach was used. This was to allow worshippers in the Church to speak for themselves without imposing pre-conceived ideas and giving value judgements. The principles of epoche and eidetic methods were allowed for self detachment. Second, a participant-observation approach was employed to enable a comparative analysis of worship sessions in the Anglican Churches in Lagos as well as selected known Pentecostal Churches like Christ's Life Church, Surulere, Deeper Life Church, Osodi and the Redemption Camp of the Redeemed Christian Church of God along Lagos-Ibadan expressway.Our study revealed that since 1988 there have been significant changes in the liturgy, the approach to evangelism and the extent of social concern in the Lagos Anglican Diocese. In our findings, the service pattern of the Anglican Church has been supplemented with the use of musical instruments like drum sets, guitar, trumpets; the songs were composed and sung in native airs; the Anglican collects were supplemented with rigorous prayers and night vigil prayers, culminating in the popular Diocesan Victory Night usually held once in every six months at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos. We also discovered that members practise glossolalia (speaking in tongues) and attend Faith Clinic programmes where deliverance usually occurred. Moreover, evangelism has taken a new dimension usually in form of carnivals, tract printing and distribution, and preaching on the radio or television. Also, caring for the needs of members and non-members alike have come to be taken more seriously than in the past.The study concluded by observing that the Anglican Church in Lagos Diocese could be properly described as truly Pentecostal in an African milieu, and noted that by incorporating Pentecostal elements into her liturgy it has been able to retain those who would have drifted away to the "new generation" Churches.|Theses Collection|Pentecostalism/Anglican Diocese of Lagos/Bishop/Primate/evangelism/Church Missionary Society/Anglican Church liturgy/high-churchmanship/epoche and eidetic methods/musical instruments/Diocesan Victory Night/speaking in tongues/Faith Clinic programmes/deliverance   *||||||Dawodu, Adekunle Ilesanmi|M|Indigenisation of christianity in the African Church in Ile-Ife 1930 -1990||||||M.A. Religious Studies|D.O.

The work also investigated the factors which led to the early schism of the African Church and highlighted the indigenous elements in worship and in the administration of the Church.The methodology employed for the study is a two-pronged approach of historical and sociological methods. For the historical method, an in-depth historical search into the genesis, growth and development of Christianity in two distinct forms was carried out. The sociological method helped to show the forms, patterns, and effects of interaction of culture and Christianity. As part of the methodology, the nature of the study necessitated a participant-observation approach.The work revealed that the present general practice of Christianity has often left out the African culture. The tragic consequence of this has been that people remained Christians only when it was convenient for them to do so, because they saw the Church as being irrelevant to their existential needs. It also revealed the autocratic system of episcopal administration in the orthodox Churches which is alien to the African understanding of communality. The feeling is strong that the Church now has a more indigenous outlook.In conclusion, the study has established that the African Church in Ile-Ife has now become a truly indigenous Church. The African features, such as indigenous music and ceremonies, are allowed to transform worship as well as positively influence the hitherto autocratic system of ecclesiastical administration along democratic principles.|Theses Collection|Indigenisation/christianity/African Church/culture/episcopal administration/orthodox Churches/autocratic system/Ile-Ife/Nigeria  *||||||Olatunbosun, Ismaila Adeniyi|M|Constraints in the  administration of criminal justice in Nigeria||||||M.Phil Law|D.A.

Data relating to the administration of criminal justice were gathered from the Constitution, the Criminal Code, Criminal Procedure Act and Penal Code. Data were also gathered from learned journals, textbooks, law reports, bulletins, newspapers and documentary reports on the televisions.The work reviewed all these data relating to criminal process and revealed that several factors accounted for the delay in the prosecution of criminal suspects. These delays occurred at the level of the Police Investigation unit such as lack of adequate and suitable equipment and facilities, lack of expert and qualified personnel, corruption, poor motivation of police officials, arbitrary transfer and retirement of efficient police official. The Judiciary was also constrained in several ways, like lack of adequate judicial personnel and courts, poor renumeration, lack of office equipment and stationery materials, series of adjournments and a host others thereby making it difficult for them to speedily try cases in courts. At the Director of Public Prosecutions' office, delay also occurred as they arc often confronted with several constraints in terms of communication gap with the police, corruption, lack of basic facilities and lack of a good library, non-availability of official vehicles, shortage of staff, lack of continuing legal education and difficulties in securing attendance of witnesses and accused persons in court. Similarly at the Prison yards, congestion and over-crowding of persons awaiting trial and in-mates have become a common phenomenon, which invariably impeded the speedy administration of criminal justice. At times, lawyers defending or prosecuting accused persons delayed prompt dispensation of justice by too many and unwarranted applications for adjournment. This work revealed that as a result of the delayed stated above, suspects suffered direct and immediate hardships. The society at large adversely felt the impact of the delays leading to the growing lack of public confidence in the criminal processes. Cases revealed that there were suspects who had spent between two and ten years in detention while awaiting trial.This work concluded that concerted effort must be made on the part of everyone connected with the administration of criminal justice in particular, and the public ingeneral, to minimize, if it can not be completely eliminated, these delays in the wheel of criminal justice in Nigeria.|Theses Collection|Criminal justice/prosecution/suspects/Criminal Procedure Act/Penal Code/investigation/corruption/poor motivation/arbitrary transfer/renumeration/prison yard/adjournment/public confidence/Nigeria*||||||Ogunrin, Adeola Bosede|F|University Education and wage employment as predictors of women empowerment in Osun State ||||||M.A. Ault Education|O.O.

It also examined the relationship between university education, economic empowerment and women participation in family and public activities, and some intervening factors restricting the access of women to university education and wage employment.A survey design was adopted for the study. The target population consisted of all women in public and private employment in Osun State. A purposive sample of 200 women was selected from women bankers, teachers, civil servants and traders. An instrument titled "Women Empowerment Questionaire" (WEQ) was developed by the researcher, and was administered on the subjects by the researcher. The instrument was validated using expert judgement. A test-retest analysis carried out on the data gathered from the pilot administration of the instrument indicated a reliability coefficient of 0.76 (p<.05). The data collected was analysed using t-test and Mann Whitney U test. The tests were conducted at the 0.05 level of significance.The result of data analysis showed that university education did not have significant influence on the economic empowerment of women (U=37067.50, P>0.05) and that women with wage employment (but without university education) had a higher level of empowerment in the decision making processes in matters affecting them. The findings also showed that university education did not have significant influence on the standard of living of women (U=3541.00, P>0.05).However, there was no significant difference between women with university education and those who have no university education in their participation in public activities (t=0.196, P.0.05).

The objective of this research is to obtain a one-dimensional model for the unsteady flow of blood in the arteries. The governing non-linear equations of the unsteady blood flow are solved by method of characteristics. Discontinuities may develop as a result of omitting from the mathematical model some aspects of the system that become significant at rapid flow changes.Using the method of wavefront expansion, an equation is derived. By this equation, explicit results about the circumstances under which shocks may form, the time and distance at which these may occur are obtained. Side branches are accounted for by the introduction of a distributed outflow function into the continuity equation used in the model. The corresponding forms for loss in momentum, and energy, due to the outflows are specified.It is concluded that outflows delay the formation of shock and reduce the temperature distribution of the arterial blood flow.|Theses Collection|Blood flow/simulation/arteries/discontinuities/flow changes/wavefront expansion/outflows/shock formation/arterial blood flow *||||||Onyia, Okey Peter|M|Effects of food-seasonings advertising on the buying behaviours of women in south-western Nigeria||||||M.Phil Business Administration|P.E.

There is no known empirical study which had been done in this area before now to measure the extent of the influence of advertising of food seasonings on the buying decision-making behaviours of women in Nigeria generally.The main objectives of the research were to see if advertising could influence perceived brand popularity and brand choice among the women and, by extention, if it could also influence their brand patronage and loyalty. This was to enable the establishment of the relationship, if any, between advertising and the consumers' buying behaviours.The primary data were collected by means of a structured questionnaire and three informal focus-group discussion sessions in the study area. Three out of the six core states of South-Western Nigeria were selected for the study. These include Lagos, Oyo and Ondo states which, by population, make up 64% of the entire region. For reasons of size, proximity, administration logistics, cost and the cosmopolitan nature of the cities, the state capitals of the three states were chosen by judgement sampling as the study area, including Lagos Metropolis, Ibadan and Akure. 1,500 questionnaires were administered, 500 in each city. A total of  1,200 (80%) were retrieved while 300 (20%) were not retrievable. One informal focus-group discussion session, consisting of ten (10) women, was also held in each of the three cities with the aid of an interpreter. Two non-parametric statistical methods were used in analysing the data and testing the two hypotheses of the study. These include the Chi-Square test (X2) and the Product Moment Co-efficient of Correlation (r).The results of the first hypothesis testing revealed that a very significant linear relationship does exist between the advertising of the seasoning brands and the perceived brand popularity among the women. This was evidenced by the computed value of X2 in the study, being 24.71, which is more than the values of XI on the distribution table at both 5% (12.592) and 1% (16.812) levels of significance against 6 degrees of freedom. This led to the rejection of the first null hypothesis and acceptance of the first alternate hypothesis of the research, thereby confirming the direct dependence of the perceived popularity of seasoning brands among the women upon the frequency of their exposure to the advertising of the brands.Furthermore, after testing the second hypothesis of the study by the Product Moment Co-efficient of Correlation, a positive 99% (+0.99) correlation was observed, indicating a very strong and positive linear relationship between the perceived brand popularity and the brand patronage of the seasonings among the women. This also led to rejection of the second null hypothesis and acceptance of the second alternate hypothesis, thereby enabling the assertion that the higher the perceived popularity of a seasoning brand due to advertising, the more the women in the study area are likely to buy and use the brand.Finally, in view of the findings and results of the survey, this researcher has concluded that the advertising of food seasoning brands in South-Western Nigeria is not only a motivating factor in the women's brand choices and purchase decisions, but also that it serves as a reinforcing factor in their brand loyalty.|Theses Collection|Food/food-seasonings/advertising/branded food/consumer/consumption behaviours/decision-making/brand patronage/loyalty/seasoning brand/women's brand choices   *||||||Ajala, Olayinka Akinsunmo|M|The analysis of spatial pattern of resources and regional development in Osun State, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

It examined the spatial distribution of some key natural and human resources and assessed the pattern of the inequalities in levels of development among the LGAs. It also sought to classify the LGAs into development planning regions.Data were collected on 45 indices of development from each of the 30 LGAs in the State for year 2001. These included agricultural production, manufacturing establishment and employment, education, health, transport, finance and population. Others included socio-economic services such as banks, hotels and petrel stations. The data generated were analysed using statistical techniques, which included descriptive statistics and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify patterns of development, logistic regression to determine the predictor variables of development and Cluster Analysis to group the Local Government Areas in to planning regions.Principal Component Analysis extracted 13 components of development which accounted for 89 percent of total variance. The first four components that contributed highly to the total variance, in terms of eigen values were discussed in this study. These four components which accounted for 56 percent of total variance, determined the development surface in the State. These were named as urban economic prosperity, higher education institution, agricultural produce/ small-scale industrial employment and infrastructural facilities. The logistic regression analysis accepted 24 out of 45 variables as the predictor variables of development in the State. Out of the 24 variables only 6 were significant as predictor variables to explain the variations in levels of development among the LGAs in the State. These included higher education institution, population density, federal allocation, local government expenditure, primary school enrolment and postal articles received or sent. The variations in component scores of each LGA confirmed the existence of inequality of development among the 30 Local Government Areas in the State. The result of the cluster analysis classified the 30 LGAs into four distinct groups on the basis of hierarchy of development, these groups were taken as planning regions. The first region comprising six LGAs was described as developed, while the remaining twenty-four LGAs fell into 3 planning regions. They were found to lag behind on various aspects of development. This grouping allowed for formulation of regional planning policy recommendation for the State. The findings of this study revealed the disparities in levels of development among the LGAs in Osun State. Many development indicators i.e. health, education; water, electricity. good road network and capital investments were concentrated in few LGAs that were urban based, which included Osogbo, Olorunda, Ilesa East, Ilesa West, lfe Central and lfe East LGAs. The study thus concluded that regional inequality of development prevailed not only among the LGAs but also between the Senatorial Districts in the State. Further studies will be required to examine the regional development impact of the identified growth centres within the State.|Theses Collection|Spatial pattern/Principal Component Analysis (PCA)/development/ Cluster Analysis/Local Government Areas/planning regions/urban economic prosperity/agricultural produce/small-scale industrial/infrastructural facilities  *||||||Aviara, Aviara Ndubisi|M|Thermodynamics characteristics of some selected tropical crops in relation to drying||||||M.Phil  Agricultural Engineering|O.O.

Thermodynamics is one of the approaches used to understand the properties of water and calculate the energy requirements of heat and mass transfer in biological systems. The moisture sorption isotherms of soybean var TGX 1.110-11 determined in the temperature and water activity ranges of -10  70°C: and 0.07 - 0.97 respectively, using the static gravimetric method, were sigmoidal in shape, of the type II, and were markedly affected by temperature. The Modified Oswin model, which gave the lowest standard error and mean relative percent deviation of 1.91% and 10.15 among live commonly used moisture sorption isotherm models, was considered the best for predicting the desorption equilibrium moisture content of soybean and its temperature dependence. The Modified Halsey model, which gave the lowest standard error and mean relative percent deviation of 0.07 and 16.67, was the best for predicting the water activity of soybean. From sorption data in the literature for cassava, plantain (ripe and unripe), melon seed, sesame seed and cowpea, the thermodynamic characteristics of these crops and soybean were analysed. The heat of vaporization of moisture in the crops decreased with increase in moisture content and approached the latent heat of pure water at a 'free water point' of between 20 and 22% moisture content (db) (soybean), about 36% (db) (cassava), 24% (db) (unripe plantain), between 32 and 34% (db) (ripe plantain), about 13% (db) (melon seed), between I8 and 21% (db) (sesame seed) and about 24% (db) (cowpea). The heat of vaporization of moisture is higher in cassava than gari - the form of cassava mash containing gelatinized starch and in ripe plantain than the unripe fruit. Monolayer moisture content varied with crop and decreased with increase in temperature. The spreading pressure of moisture in the crops generally increased with increase in water activity and did not show much temperature dependence except for cassava, melon seed and cowpea in the high range of water activity (aw>0.6). Net integral enthalpy of moisture sorbed varied with crop and decreased with increase in moisture content most of the crops with the trend becoming asymptotic as the moisture contents of 13 (soybean), 15 (unripe plantain), 30 (ripe plantain), 10 (melon seed), 12 (sesame seed) and 18% (db) (cowpea) were approached. The net integral enthalpy of cassava and gari initially increased with increase in moisture content to a maximum value at moisture  integral enthalpy is higher in cassava than gari, and in ripe plantain than the unripe fruit. The net integral entropy of moisture sorbed in soybean, cassava and gari, unripe and ripe plantain and sesame seed decreased with increase in moisture content to a minimum value at the moisture contents of 11, 12, 12.5 and 25, and 4.0% (db) respectively, and thereafter, increased with increase in moisture content. The net integral entropy of moisture sorbed in melon seed and cowpea increased continually with moisture content, but remained negative in value. 1 Thermodynamic characteristics are, therefore, moisture dependent. and in relation to drying, they show that the energy requirement varies crop composition and can be affected by such processes as gelatinizatation of starch and ripening of fruits.|Theses Collection|Drying/energy intensive operation/agricultural products/energy consumption/ thermodynamics/moisture sorption isotherms/temperature/modified Halsey model/Net integral enthalpy/asymptotic/gelatinizatation  *||||||Mabawonku, Oluwafunminiyi|M|Theaethetics of selected Yoruba women's oral literature||||||M.Phil Literature-in- English|M.E.M.

The selected Yoruba women's oral arts were ekun Iyawo and Orin obinrin ile in Ijebu.The research was carried out through fieldwork and library research. Some oral interviews were conduct with a view to explaining the meaning of some concepts in Yoruba oral tradition. A thorough general features and content analysis of some samples of nuptial chants and lineage wives songs were considered. In addition, the aesthetics in the style of composition of the oral arts, which was through its heavy reliance on word play and tonal counterpoint, mirrored the arts as one that was susceptible to various levels of communication and meaning.Through a semiotic interpretation of the women's oral arts, it was found out that oral literature as performed by the oral artist was not an art realizable through .Monostyle communication alone. Aesthetically, the artist communicated through the performance of the art by means of a language; the art equally communicated through the artist. This finding differentiated this work form previous works in the area as it pointed out that communication was achieved not only through auditory means but also through visual means. It used signs and symbols in relations to language. Furthermore, the study found out that both the interiority and exteriority of the artist combined in the production of the oral art. The inner make up and feelings (symptom signal) of the artist aligned with her physical stance and posture (sign signal) in the overall production of the oral art. The outcome of the alignment resulted in a system synchronization of the signs and symbols which semiosis represented.It was concluded that the aesthetics of the women's oral arts were enmeshed in the content, mode and style of delivery which semiotics, as a theory, explained through its five principal channels, namely, icon, index, symbols, signs and	symptoms signals.All these put together, enriched the women's oral genres and made it an artistic martial worth studying.|Theses Collection|Theaethetics/Yoruba women's oral literature/oral arts/semiotics/ekun Iyawo/Orin obinrin ile in Ijebu/nuptial chants/lineage wives songs/Monostyle communication/language/posture (sign signal)/artistic martial *||||||Ijadunola, Kayode Thadius|M|Determinants of physician's attitudes toward communication with HIV/AIDs patients in Ile-Ife||||||M.Sc.

The quantitative survey employed a descriptive cross-sectional design using a self-administered, semi-structured questionnaire to elicit information or, the socio-demographic variables of the physicians, their perceptions of and attitudes toward communication with HIV/AIDS patients under their care. The qualitative design consisted of in-depth interviews conducted in the homes of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) who had been previously admitted under the care of the physicians..Majority (62%) of the physicians reported that they have been involved in the care of HIV/AIDS patients for at least five years, mean duration of care being 5.0+2.4 years, but three quarters of them estimated the number of HIV/AIDS patients they treated per month to be less than five. Only 20% of physicians had ever undergone any training in HIV/AIDS counseling and just 43% of them expressed any degree of comfort communicating the diagnosis of HIV to patients. While the expectations of PLWHA was that their physicians engage them in discussions on all aspects of their disease condition and coping strategies for everyday living, these expectations were not being met by the physicians. Only 15% of physicians would personally create an opportunity for interaction with the HIV/AIDS patients under their care, while 6.5% would avoid such interactions altogether. Almost half of the physicians confirmed that they did not spend enough time with PLWHA during their periods of interaction, but 80% of them reported that they would like to continue interacting with PLWHA. Attitudinal ratings of the physicians revealed that 58% of them displayed a positive attitude toward communicating with HIV/AIDS patients, and the strongest predictors of positive attitudes were the number of HIV/AIDS patients treated per month, specialty of practice of physicians, the number of years spent in the care of PLWHA, previous exposure to HIV/AIDS counseling and the gender of the physicians.The study concluded that physicians in Ile-Ife perceived HIV/AIDS patients positively, and majority of them displayed a positive attitude toward communication with PLWHA. However, they were not adequately equipped by way of training to effectively meet the expectations of their patients concerning HIV/AIDS communication. The study pointed out the need for incorporating courses on health communication and counseling for chronic diseases generally and HIV/AIDS in particular into the training curriculum of physicians at all levels.|Theses Collection|HIV/AIDS patients/physicians/ people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA)/communication/counseling/health/diseases*||||||Williams, Babajide Agboola|M|The relationship between literacy education and performance of women in vocational training centres in Osun State, Nigeria||||||M.A. Adult Education|T.O Fasokun//O.O.

It compared the teaching strategies employed in the teaching of Social Studies in the colleges and ascertained the availability and adequacy of the materials and facilities used for the achievement of the goals of the Social Studies curriculum.Two different samples were used for the study. The first sample consisted of 10 lecturers in the Department of Social Studies in the two Colleges of Education. The second sample consisted of 685 students made up of 577 students in the Department of Social Studies, Osun State College of Education, Ila-Orangun and 108 students in the Department of Social Studies, Osun State College of Education, Ilesa. The subjects were selected using proportionate stratified random sampling technique. Data for the study were collected from documentary records in the two colleges and through the administration of two research instruments. The first instrument is a questionnaire titled Students' Evaluation of Social Studies Curriculum (SESCQ) while the second instrument is also a questionnaire titled Lecturers' Evaluation of Social Studies curriculum (LESCQ). Data collected were analysed using descriptive and chi-square statistics.The results of data analysis showed that contents of Social Studies curriculum were the same in the two colleges and were in line with the objectives of Social Studies as specified by the National Council for Social Studies. The result of the study also showed that significant differences existed in the strategies employed by lecturers in disseminating facts and ideas in the two Colleges of Education when considering creative activity (÷ 2 = 8.558, p < 0.05), field trip ( ÷ 2 = 7.048, p < 0.05), problem solving ( ÷2 = 51.776, p < 0.05), dramatization (÷ 2 = 10.501, p < 0.05), simulation (÷ 2 = 7.115, p < 0.05) and questioning (÷2 = 6.606, p < 0.05).

In the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, health care is on the concurrent list that it is expected to be provided by the Local. State and Federal Governments in the country. A convenient sample of six out of the eighteen Local Government Areas (LGA) were selected for the study, which was conducted in three parts. First was the study of available facilities in the selected LGA's, secondly the study of consumers of health care, and thirdly the study of policy makers and five health care providers in the state. The policy makers interviewed consisted of the chairperson, the secretary and the supervisory councillor for health in each L.G.A. as well as some key officers in the State Ministry of Health. Both primary and secondary data were collected and analysed. The primary data were collected using a structured questionnaire designed for the study and interview schedules. while secondary data was collected from available records from the health institutions in the selected Local Government Areas and the State Ministry of Health. The subject were selected by stratified sampling. The data collected were analysed by descriptive statistics using Tables, frequency ratios, percentages and bar charts with the aid of appropriate computer software where necessary.From the study it was revealed that out of twenty-one (2I) health facilities studied the majority (80.95%) have less than 20 beds, and they rarely handle cases with mental disorder. Only medical officers, general nurses, midwives and community health officers had basic training in mental health while other categories of health professions had little or no basic training in mental health. Infact, no occupational therapist was/were unevenly distributed between urban and rural areas. It was also found out that 76.2% mental health  of care  brought to the public health facilities were referred while only a small percentage (4.8%) were treated. Malaria fever tops that list of (of the 4.8%) cases treated in these facilities. It was only at the Neuropsychiatic Hospital in Akure that provisions have been made for those who suffer from mental illness. Majority of people with mental illness are aged between 31  40 years, married, self employed and mostly males. Facilities for mental health care is virtually absent in most local government areas of Ondo State, hence help is sought only at the Neuropsychriatic Hospital in Akure, a far distance to majority of the LGAs. Its implication is that mental health is not incorporated into primary health care as recommended by the National Mental Health Policy and Programme.  The same is true for the secondary health care system. The provision for special groups like the mentally retarded is grossly inadequate. It is recommended that government at all levels should make a conscious effort at ensuring compliance with the minimum requirements as stipulated in the National Mental Health Care Policy and Programmes. It is then we would be moving close to health for all in year 2020 and years beyond.|Theses Collection|Health/mental health services/ State Ministry of Health/midwives/community health officers/ Neuropsychiatic Hospital/National Mental Health Care Policy and Programmes *||||||Kupoluyi Joseph Ayodeji|M|Attitude of men towards family planning and sexually transmitted diseases (STDS) in Ilesa local government Area Osun state,Nigeria||||||M.Sc(Demograhy and Socail Statistics)|J.A Ebigbola||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,Demography and Social Statistics|2003|||OAU|||||xv,189p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

It specifically investigated men's knowledge and their level of spousal communication in relation to the use of contraceptives, their involvement in the use of condoms as a means of family planning or as a prevention of STDs especially HIV/AIDS, and their attitude to safer sex. bearing in mind the risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including HIV/AIDS.The data used were collected through interview schedule in' which 300 respondents -220 men aged 20 years and above, and 80 women of reproductive age (15-49) were randomly selected and interviewed. Data were analysed in three stages i.e. Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate The logistic regression model was used to establish the relationship between response variables and explanatory variables.The study found that knowledge of contraceptive methods was relatively high while usage was relatively low. Majority used contraceptive methods for birth spacing and for the prevention of STDs. Monogamously married men were more likely to be knowledgeable about contraceptive methods and their usage than men who were in other unions. They were also more likely to have discussed desired family size and when to stop childbearing with their partners. Awareness of STDs and its mode of transmission were relatively high while the use of condom was relatively low. Unmarried men were found to be more likely to use condom for STDs than married men. Men who were not staying with their families were more likely to have used condom for the prevention of STDs than men who were staying with their families. It was also found that the number of male respondents who had ever contracted STDs was relatively low in the study area. Polygamously married men were more likely to have contracted and treated for STDs than men who were in polygynous union. However, men who had contracted and treated for STDs 12 months prior to the survey were more likely to have changed their sexual behaviour in preventing HIV/AIDS by stopping the use of unsterilized instruments/needles rather than the use of condom and/or stick to one sexual partner than men who were not. Based on the findings, it was observed that failure of respondents to use condom or stick to one sexual partner would have great implications for the spread of STDs including HIV/AIDS. This implied that the awareness of HIV/AIDS was yet to have any positive impact on male sexual behaviour in the study area.|Theses Collection|Family planning/sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/contraceptives/condoms/HIV/AIDS/child control/monogamy/polygamy/unsterilized instruments/needles *||||||Famurewa, Akindele Joshua|M|Purification and characterization of the Enzyme system in Ocimum gratissimum Linn leaves which synthensizes prostaglandin-like compounds||||||Ph.D(Biochemistry)|F.D Onajobi||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,Biochemistry|2003|||OAU|||||xvii,161p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Homogenates and subcellular fractions of the plant leaves have been shown, by radioactive and spectrophotometric assays, to synthesize prostaglandin-like compounds when incubated with eicosatrienoic or arachidonic acids. Consequently, attempts have been made to purify and characterize the prostaglandin synthetase-like (PSL) enzyme in O. gratissimum leaves with a view to comparing its characteristics with those of animal prostaglandin synthetase.The PSL enzyme was assayed by a spectrophotometric method that is based on the oxidation of adrenaline to a pink-coloured adrenochrome (which absorbs at Xmax 320nm, pH 9.7 or Xmax 480nm at pH 8.7) when used as a cofactor in the enzyme catalyzed conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids to prostaglandins. The assay system thus consisted of adrenaline, 50mM Tris-HCI buffer, pH 8.7 or 50mM sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.7, arachidonic or linoleic acid, and 20,000g supernatant, microsomes or column fractions of O. gratissimum leaf homogenate. The assay was carried out at 25°C in a spectrophotometer and absorbance at 320 or 480nm was recorded. Boiled enzyme preparation was used in control assays:Enzyme activity was measured as A320 or 480nm/min where DA320 or 480nm = A320 or 480nm using fresh enzyme minus A320 or 480nm using boiled enzyme. Purification ofthe PSL enzyme was carried out on Sephadex G-100 column, eluting with 50mM Tris-HCI buffer, pH 8.0 containing 1mM EDTA and 1mM GSH, followed by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE Biogel A, equilibrated with 50mM Tris-HCI buffer, pH 8.0 and eluting with NaCl (0.3-1.5M) gradient.The purification step resulted in three fractions with enzymic activity (A, B and C), each giving a single band on SDS-PAGE. Component C, eluting around 1.2M NaCl was the most active, with a molecular weight of 27,300 Daltons (Rm = 0.469). The PSL enzyme showed greater specificity for arachidonic than for lineoleic acid. The rate of reaction increased with increasing arachidonic acid concentration up to 15.0 x 10-6 M and thereafter decreased. Enzyme activity also increased linearly as hydroquinone concentration was increased from 5.0 x 10-6 M to 2.0 x 10-4 M. When the PSL enzyme was heated, peaks of activity were observed around 5 and 45oC. Quantitative analysis of the temperature effect by Arrhenius plot showed that the enzyme has more than one catalytic activity.Flufenamic acid and indomethacin inhibiter the enzyme with the percentage inhibition varying with concentration. Since these compounds are specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenases in animal prostaglandin synthetases, the results indicate that the PSL enzyme operates through the cyclooxygenase pathway.Potassium cynanide also inhibited the purified fractions B and C, indicating that the enzyme contains haem. The absorption spectrum of enzyme C was similar to that of prostaglandin synthetase of ram seminal vesicles in having one Soret band at 420nm and two other bands (á = 560 nm and â = 590 nm).In conclusion, the results indicated that O. gratissimum contains a prostaglandin synthetasewith characteristics similar to animal prostaglandin synthetase, which operates through a cyclooxygenase pathway.|Theses Collection|Ocimum gratissimum Linn leaves/medicinal plant/therapeutic value/adioactive/spectrophotometric assays/prostaglandin synthetase-like (PSL) enzyme/enzyme/oxidation/adrenochrome/ polyunsaturated fatty acids/Sephadex G-100 column/Flufenamic acid/Potassium cynanide *||||||Akindoyin, Reuben Akinsode|M|Parenting styles as correlates of social adjustments in three local Government areas in Ibadan,Oyo State||||||M.A(Guidance and counselling)|K.A Alao||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,Educational foundations|2003|||OAU|||||vii,148p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The sample for the study comprised of 301 each of students and parents selected by cluster sampling technique from nine secondary schools in lbadan, Oyo State. Two questionnaires were used to collect data for the study. They were the Social Adjustment Scale Questionnaire (SASQ) and Parenting Style Scale Questionnaire (PASSQ). The two instruments had test-retest reliability coefficients of 0.74 and 0.79 respectively (n = 30, p <0.05). The two instruments were administered on the selected students and their parents by the researcher. Data collected were analysed using frequency counts and Chi-square statistical procedure.The results of the study showed that there was a significant relationship between parenting styles and social adjustment of secondary school students (X =12.8 df = 3, p<0.05).

It also investigated the influence of selected socio-demographic variables such as gender, age, religion, faculty, level of study in the university, location of home, and place of residence during academic session on student sexual behaviour.A sample of 2106 students (female = 993; male = 1113) was selected purposively from three universities in Southwestern Nigeria. These universities are Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife; University of Lagos, Lagos; and University of Ado-Ekiti, Ado-Ekiti. Six faculties namely Education, Technology, Health Sciences, Law, Science and Social Sciences representing proportionally humanities and science based faculties were selected from these three universities.Data for the study were collected using two research instruments. The first one was a Questionnaire on Perception of AIDS (QPA) while the second one was Sexual Behaviour Inventory (SBI). The data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics.The results of the data analysis indicated that 54% of the students had steady boy/girl friends, 63% had had sexual intercourse. Eighty-one per cent believed AIDS exists, 82% were of the view that AIDS is a disease associated with sexual intercourse and 48% believed AIDS could be cured. Results further showed student sexual behaviour had a significant positive relationship with student perception of AIDS (r =.245,p < 0.05) but had no significant relationship with student's source of information about AIDS (r= -.002, p >0.05). Student gender also had a significant negative influence on student sexual behaviour (t = -3.46, p <0.05).

A 15-item self-developed questionnaire with test-retest reliability of r = 0.82 (p-value < .01) was used for data collection Data analysis was carried out with the use of descriptive and inferential statistical procedures.Findings of the study revealed that respondents had positive as well as negative perception of hospitalization. Majority (78.3%) of the respondents reported hospitalization as providing specialized care, while others reported that it helps in regaining health in good time. All (100%) the respondents reported that hospitalization provides for increased knowledge about illness and life in illness state, allows for adequate rest.Furthermore, all the respondents reported that hospitalization creates unnecessary delay for procedures and put patient in a strange environment. A good number (90%) of respondents reported that it is too expensive, restrictive, isolating and allows for personnel/patient role conflicts. The study also discovered that hospitalized young adults complained more of loneliness, anxiety and feelings of loss of control. Despite all the complaints, majority (80%) of the respondents still expressed willingness to utilize hospitalization in future if the need arises. The study further revealed that utilization of health care facilities is associated with family financial support (Cramer's V and Phi 0.202 and 0.286 respectively, at p<.05).It concluded that patients' perception of hospitalization does not determine their utilization of health care facilities but family financial support does.

Firstly, two processing factors, namely raw materials type (RMT) (i.e. chips and flour) and raw material drying mode (RDM) (i.e. sun and oven-drying at 55°C) were related to the quality of the dried chips and flour in a 22 factorial experiment. Secondly, three processing factors, namely RMT, RDM and SDM (starch drying mode) were related to the yield and quality of starch in a 23 factorial experiment. Thirdly, a two-way ANOVA experiment was conducted to determine the effects of raw material type, and TRT1 (process water types and treatments) on the yield and quality of starch. Finally, two processing factors, namely, raw material type and TRT2 (process water types into which SO2 was dissolved) were also related to starch yield and quality, and the effects determined by using a paired t-test. The starch quality characteristics investigated were, moisture content, pH, crude fibre content, colour, speck count, cleanliness, peak viscosity and pasting temperature.RMT had a significant effect (P>0.05) on the peak viscosity of the dried chips and flour investigated, with mean values of 396.94 Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA) and 502.12 RVA units respectively. Starch yields from oven-dried chips and flour (using tap water for extraction) were significantly higher (at 5%) than from sun-dried materials. Similarly yields from flour were observed to be significantly higher than those from chips. Average values were 50.96g and 41.93g respectively (per 70g of dried product). The peak viscosity (PV) of starches extracted from flours was significantly higher (at 5%) than those from chips with average values of 565.22 and 550.08 RVA units respectively. Oven-dried starches have peak viscosities which were significantly higher than sundried starches with average values of 576.22 and 539.08RVA units respectively. Addition of alum to process water significantly influenced the pasting temperatures of starches from chips compared to those from flour, with the former having temperatures much higher than the latter. Starch yields were highest when filtered well water (FWW) was used for extraction and lowest when filtered stream water (FSW) was applied. The addition of alum and SO2 to process water was conclusively implicated in the significant depression in the peak viscosities of the starches extracted. The findings in this work have demonstrated that it is possible to produce good quality starches (from dried cassava chips and flour) to meet international standards. Both sun and oven-dried starches from dried cassava chips and flour were shown to be capable of meeting the requirements of the textile industries (Indian specifications). Oven-dried starches extracted from oven-dried flour were however assessed to possess the most desirable mix of yield and quality characteristics. In conclusion, oven-dried flour was therefore identified as the most suited to serve as feedstock for the extraction of industrial quality starch.|Theses Collection|Starch/cassava/dried cassava flour/peak viscosity/pasting temperature/cassava chips/textile industries (Indian specifications)/oven-dried flour/industrial quality starch/Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA).*||||||Osezua, Oghoadena Clementina|F|Esan women migrants and hometown development in Irrua and Uromi commuinities of Edo State||||||M.Sc.

In order to achieve this. The study evaluated the migrant women's perception of development with regard to their home communities and assessed their contribution to the development of their home communities.The data were collected from two purposively selected community - based Associations in Lagos: the Irrua Daughters' and Wives' Association (UDWA) and the Uromi Daughters' and Wives' Association. On the whole, 24 in-depth-interviews were held with some key Executive Officers and selected members of both Associations. Also 12 sessions of Focus Group Discussion were also held with some respondents, chosen on the basis of marriage, education and occupation. A total of 10 case-studies were used to determine the socio-economic status of these Esan women migrants. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, content analyses and z-y index tables.The study revealed that Esan women migrants had made useful contributions in terms of provision of social amenities for their home bases. These included the provision of a block of Hostel Accommodation for Female students in Ambrose Ali University, Ekpoma, the renovation of the General Hospital Uromi and a total overhauling which involved the refurbishing of its morgue, and the hospital ambulance. Also, these women provided scholarship for orphans in the Zuma Memorial Orphanage Home, Irrua. The women migrants also provided social support system for young emigrants from their home towns by providing them with accommodation, feeding and business contact which helped them settled down in Lagos. However most of the women identified the current economic recession in the country as the major problem constraining the Association in making more contributions to their home base. They also emphasized the problem of multiple commitments of members to other bodies like religious and professional organizations.The study concluded that the nature and extent of women contribution to local communities, had been negatively affected by some socio-cultural factors like patriarchy, lack of homogeneity of the members of their association, inconsistency and unreliable behavior of some members.|Theses Collection|*||||||Iyiola, Robinson Olugbade|M|Some distributional properties and inference on sample entropy index and an illustration with a class of geometric distributions||||||M.Sc.

Exploring a parallel with the queueing model of batch arrivals into an ecological community in singles, pairs and triples led to the formulation of a class of pure and mixed geometric distributions( MGD). Expressions for the Kth moments and consequently, means and variances of these models were derived in terms of parameters m and p. Maximum likelihood estimation was employed to estimate the parameters of the model and techniques for hypothesis testing were developed. The mixture of geometric distributions for arrivals in pairs(l = 2) and arrivals in triples (1 = 3)herein referred to as Mixed Geometric Distributions MGD(2,3) were fitted to three sets of data from the literature with some form of bimodality.It was revealed by goodness of fit test at level á = 0.01 that while MGD(2,3) for á= 0.0 otherwise known as pure truncated geometric distribution for l = 2 fitted the Sowbugs data, MGD(2.3) for á = 0.5 and á = 0.6 were most. suitable for other two sets of data. This is further corroborated by t-test analyses on the entropy index H(X) that showed a non-significant difference between the fitted pure truncated geometric MGD(2,3)for á = 0.0 and the sowbugs data as well as a general non-significant difference between the fitted MGD(2,3)for various values of a (apart from á = 0.1).In conclusion, it is established that the batch arrival model results in mixtures of geometric distributions which sufficiently capture such essential indices as theentropy index H(X) for the various sets of data.|Theses Collection|*||||||Fasanu, Olusegun Peter|M|Biochemical studies of the phytotoxin of African mistletoe (Phragmanthera Incana, Schum, balle) fresh leaves||||||M.Sc.

Salle) with a view to investigating its physicochemical properties and biological activities in Sprague-Dawley rats, so as to be able to compare the plant with mistletoes from other parts of the world.Phytotoxin designated as Phragmanthin was purified from the fresh leaves of African mistletoe, P. incana, by a procedure that consisted of homogenization with dilute glacial acetic acid (2% v/v), filtration, centrifugation, dialysis, gel filtration (Sephadex G400 and Bio-gel P-60) as well as sodium dodecyl sulphatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzymes assayed for included alkaline phosphatase with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (disodium salt) as substrate and L-alanine aminotransferase/L-aspartate aminotransferase using Randox Diagnostic kit. Level of creatinine by Jaffe's alkaline picrate reaction, Fiske and Subbarow reaction for inorganic phosphate, blood haemoglobin concentration as cyanmethaemoglobin derivative, estimation of muscle glycogen was based on anthrone/sulphuric acid reaction and albumin was estimated as described in Sigma Chemical Limited catalogue. The colorimetric method based on phenolfolin reaction was employed to estimate total protein concentrations in the plasma and liver homogenates; while phenol/sulphuric acid reaction was used to estimate total blood sugars.The results revealed that Phragmanthin was a low molecular weight protein of about 10,200 Daltons. It was adjudged to be a single polypeptide by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a very low haemagglutinin activity. Furthermore, studies on biochemical parameters of Sprague-Dawley rats revealed that the protein caused significant reduction in the levels of plasma inorganic phosphate (533%), plasma protein (43.6%), haemoglobin (23.9%), and alkaline phosphatase (78.5%), muscle glycogen (17.7%), plasma albumin (25.4%) and blood sugar (19.9%). Moreover it exhibited a significant increase in the levels of plasma LLaspartate aminotransferase activity (16A%) and creatinine (42.3%).The study concluded that, based on the levels of plasma protein,activities of L-alanine and L-aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, haemoglobin and other biochemical parameters, the protein was deemed to be affecting the heart, kidney and possibly the liver cells. The significant reduction of the blood sugar in the experimental animals (19.9%) could indicate that Phragmantin have sugar lowering activity.|Theses Collection|*||||||Gbobaniyi, Emiola Olabode|M|Application of statistical downscaling tecniques in regional climate modelling for West Africa||||||M.Sc.

The study investigated the suitability of using a statistical downscaling method to reduce output from a General Circulation Model (GCM) in order to derive useful information on climatic indices at local levels.The GCM output used in the study is a 1950-2002 time slice from the ECHAM 4.5 model run at the International Research Institute (IRI) of Columbia University. It is a T42 resolution model with 19 levels in the vertical. Statistical transformations were applied to the GCM output using the Model Output Statistics (MOS) technique. Geopotential height, humidity, temperature, zonal and meridional wind fields at 200, 700, 850 and 1000 hPa as were separately employed as predictors. A precipitation dataset for the 40 year period 1960-2000 from 33 synoptic stations across Nigeria was used as predictand. Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) analysis was applied to the GCM field to capture its main variance in as few modes as possible. These were used to predict the rainfall over the Nigerian region for the same 40 year period 1960-2000 for which observed data are available, in order to compare between downscaled and coarse GCM output.Results showed that meridional wind field at the 850 hPa level when used as predictor gave the highest overall correlation for downscaled precipitation. . Significant skill levels (up to 0.52 for some stations) were observed. The GCM over predicted rainfall for most of the stations investigated while it underestimated rainfall for a few. The result of the comparison between precipitation forecast by the GCM, downscaled precipitation and observed historical data showed that the downscaled precipitation forecasts agreed more with actual observation than the coarse resolution GCM forecasts.The study concluded that the statistical downscaling technique is a useful, relatively inexpensive and practical method of downscaling GCM data to local scales in this region.|Theses Collection|*||||||Oloniyo, Michael Olanrewaju|M|Socio-cvultural factors and the incidence of hypertension among Obafemi Awolowo University staffs 1996 - 2000||||||M.Sc.

The main objectives of the study were to examine the relationship between socio-economic variables such as age, sex, marital status, education etc and the incidence of hypertension among the different categories of staff; examine health behaviour pattern among the staff generally in respect to hypertension; examine illness behaviour pattern among the hypertensive patients i.e. degree of compliance with follow-up appointments and with drug therapy; and identify the prevalent type of hypertension among the staff.The study made use of case-control design. The data were generated using both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The former were collected through interviews. While the latter were, collected via semi-structured questionnaire. The respondents were selected using multi-stage sampling technique  comprising Clustering, Stratified and Systematic sampling techniques. In all 600 respondents comprising ASUU, SSANU and NASU were used for the study. The data were analysed using parametric and non-parametric statisticsFindings from the study revealed that not all the socio-economic variables had any significant relationship with the incidence of hypertension among the study groups especially among the SSANU. Among the SSANU group, it was found that age, marital status, family size and educational status were all significant to the incidence of hypertension; large family and dependant sizes were common significant variables to all the three groups. With regards to health behaviour, most variables were significant to the incidence of hypertension among the study groups. This showed that the health behaviour pattern of the group was poor. However, the academic staff exhibited more positive health behaviour than the other two groups. In terms of the illness behaviour of the study population it was found that they were not taking hypertensive drugs regularly. Some of the subjects opted for other therapies, while some complained of the cost and scarcity of the drugs at the health centre. The study showed that the illness behaviour variables were all significant among the study groups.The study concluded that the effect of socio-political and economic problem and the cultural behaviours had resulted into early death in the society. This problem no doubt, had crippled the standard of living and quality of life. The environmental and socio-economic factors have put the study population at risk of increased cases of hypertension and other non-communicable diseases.|Theses Collection|*||||||Owojori, Olugbenga John|M|Ecology of schistosoma intermediate snail hosts in Opa reservoir and research farm ponds at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife||||||M.Sc.

Stations I  4 were located on the Research farm ponds
while the other 5  11 were on Opa Reservoir. Each station was sampled once every month for snail type and distribution, physico-chemical characteristics of water, human water
contact patterns and vegetation cover. Snail sampling was carried out using the Hairston drag scoop supplemented by a manual search for 30 man-minutes. Snails collected were sorted,
identified to species, counted, measured and recorded. Known intermediate host species were examined for trematode infection using the crushing method. Water parameters like depth,
transparency, air and water temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand and alkalinity were determined using appropriate methods. Marginal,
floating and emergent macrophytes were identified and quantified for coverage. Human water contact behaviour was observed on each day from 8.00a.m. to 6.00p.m. This included
detailed activities of persons entering and leaving water; their sex, age, and extent of body parts immersed in water. Data were analysed using the non-parametric statistical methods.
The most important human-water contact behaviour observed in the ponds and reservoir during this study period was fishing, swimming and washings of all kinds.
Generally, more contacts were made in the reservoir than the ponds. The frequency and duration of contacts made by males were higher than females (p < 0.01). Also, 76.1% of all
contacts were made in station 5. Most of the water parameters measured varied with seasons and are fairly similar in both water bodies. Conductivity and pH were higher during the dryseason when compared to the rainy season while dissolved oxygen was higher in the rainy season. The aquatic cover varies between stations but the one at stations 5 was remarkably higher with Ludwigia erecta predominating. A total of 9,524 snails belonging to four families, six subfamilies, seven genera and ten species were collected for all the sites The species are Bulinus globosus, B. truncatus, B. forskalii, Biomphalaria pfeifferi, Potadoma moerchi, P. freethi, Melanoides, tuberculata, Lanistes libycus, Lynnaea natalensis and Gyraulus costulatus. The first four which are potential intermediate snail hosts of human and animal diseases constituted 14.4% of the total snails collected. Out of these intermediate host species, 97 (9.0%) were infected with nematode larvae belonging to four major cercarial types (amphistome cercaria, ornatae xiphidiocercaria, cercariaeum cercaria and furcocercous cercaria) and three sub-types of furcocercous cercaria (brevifurcate apharyngeate distome cercaria, longifurcate pharyngeate distome cercaria and brevifurcate apharyngeate monostome cercaria). Brevifulcate apharyngeate distome cercaria, the schistosome type cercariae were recovered from B. globosus collected from station 5. The high concentration of a marginal macrophyte Ludwigia erecta also correlated positively with a high incidence of B. globous especially in station S.This study concluded that all the water bodies possessed schistose carrying snails and the water conditions favour their survival throughout the year, thus humans exposed to these water bodies have a high potential for contracting schistosomiasis.|Theses Collection|*||||||Adegoke, Adekunle Anthony|M|The influence of HIV/AIDs public enlightenment campaigns on sexual behaviour of secondary school adolescents in Ibadan metroplois||||||Ph.D. Psycology|Akinsola A.

It also assessed the influence of adolescents' age, sex and parental educational status on their sexual behaviours, and knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about HIV/AIDS. The relationship between adolescents' knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs (KAB) about HIV/AIDS and sexual behaviours were also explored.The research adopted a descriptive method and data were collected cross- sectionally through a survey conducted among senior secondary school adolescents. The sample consisted of 1902 (917 males and 985 females) students in SS1-SS3 classes within ages 12-20 years (M =16, SD = 1.46) drawn from 20 secondary schools in five local government areas of Ibadan metropolis using stratified random sampling technique. Three self-report paper-and-pencil instruments measuring adolescents' exposure to HIV/AIDS enlightenment campaigns, knowledge, attitudes and beliefs (KAB) about HIV/AIDS and sexual behaviours were used in collecting data from the respondents. Data generated from the survey were subjected to both descriptive and inferential analyses using Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS) version 11.0. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used appropriately to test fourteen hypotheses formulated for the study. The study showed that adolescents have been exposed to varieties of HIV/AIDS enlightenment campaigns. The broadcast media was found to have more significant influence on adolescents' sexual behaviours (B = 0.217; t =8.769, P <0.0001), while the print media exerted greater influence on their knowledge, attitudes and beliefs (KAB) about HIV/AIDS (f3 = 0.246; t = 10.358; P < 0.001). It also revealed that HIV/AIDS public enlightenment campaigns, age, sex, parental educational status, and knowledge, attitudes and beliefs (KAB) about HIV/AIDS were found to have significant influence on adolescents' sexual behaviours (F (2.1263) = 4.273; p = 0.014). Public enlightenment campaigns had negative influence on adolescents' sexual behaviours (F (1.1811) = 11.209, P < 0.001). Adolescents' knowledge, attitude and beliefs about HIV/AIDS had significantly positive influence on their sexual behaviours (F (1.1811) = 31.704; P<0.0001). Older adolescents were found to be significantly higher in sexual behaviours than younger adolescents (F (1.1811) = 25.825; P< 0.0001), while male adolescents exhibited significantly more sexual behaviours than female adolescents (F (1.1811). 59.597; P <0.0001). Also, adolescents from parents with low educational status were more sexually experienced and more active than other adolescents from parents with higher educational status. The study further showed that adolescents' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about HIV/AIDS were positively influenced by their exposure to HIV/AIDS public enlightenment campaigns (F (1.1787) = 3.891; p = 0.049) and parental educational status F 2.1787) = 2.452; p < 0.0001). The study concluded that majority of secondary school adolescents had been exposed to a lot of HIV/AIDS public enlightenment campaigns and these campaigns had succeeded in positively influencing their knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about HIV/AIDS but had no significant positive influence on adolescents' sexual behaviours.|Theses Collection|*||||||Kadiri, Sunmola Adegoke|M|The effectiveness of the personalised system of instruction in mathematics among secondary school studies in Osun State||||||Ph.D. Curriculum Studies|O.J.

The subjects for the study consisted of 360 senior secondary 1 (SS1) students randomly selected, from nine schools in three Local Government Areas: Ori-Ade, Ilesa East and Ilesa West in Osun State of Nigeria. There were two experimental groups. Group I was taught algebraic equations using the PSI with teaching assistants as proctors and Group II was taught by the PSI with student peers as proctors. 'The control group was taught by the conventional method of teaching. The main instruments for the study were: an Achievement Test of Mathematical Background (ATEMB) used to measure the background knowledge of the subjects in mathematics; an Achievement Test of Problem-solving Skill* (ATEPS) which was used as the pre-test and post-test; and a Retention Test of Problem-solving Skill (RETEPS) used to measure retention. Post experimental opinion of the subjects about the PSI was also sought using an Opinionnaire. Data collected were analysed using the Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). Data from the Opinionnaire were analysed using the t-test and the Chi-square statistics.The result showed that students taught mathematics by either of the two variants of the PSI performed better in solving mathematical problems than those taught using the conventional method [F (2,359) = 380.0, p<0.05]. The two experimental groups performed better in the retention of material learnt than the control group [F (2,359) = 392.2, p<0.05]. The opinions of the subjects favoured the use of PSI more than the conventional method. However, the performances of the two experimental groups were not significantly different in the post-test performance. There was no significant difference in the opinion of the two PSI groups (t=1.08, p>0.05). Finally, the results showed that sex had no significant effect on the mathematics problem-solving ability of the subjects in the experimental groups.  The study concluded that the PSI could be used to enhance the 'mathematics problem solving ability as well as the retention of mathematical principles of secondary school students.|Theses Collection|*||||||Ola, James Idowu|M|Distribution and distribution - free methods of estimation of count -based indices of aggregation in ecology||||||M.Sc.

Common distribution used iii the literature for the statistical analysis of indices of aggregation and also methods for estimation of parameters were considered. The distribution models adopted are the Negative Binomial and Conditional Mixed Binomial models. The parameters of the negative binomial distribution were fited by the moment and Maximum Likelihood (M.L) estimators while that of conditional binomial distribution were fitted by estimators constrained to ample mean (T), "zero" frequency for even probability (T0) combined with "one'requency for odd probability (T1) and weighted average T01 and  T0 and T1roblem of confidence interval estimation of indices of spatial aggregation based on counts was considered. A distributions free method based on a straight forward application of the jackknife was presented which was useful for reducing the bias of an estimator. Application of the method to one sample problem was illustrated with the same data analysed by distribution dependent method.For the two sets of data used for illustration. The Jackknife (distribution free) method and the Negative Binomial (N.B) model gave acceptable indices of interest. This was further reflected by the goodness of fit test significant level. In the case of the conditional mixed Binomial model, the performance was not particularly significant. In all cases however, it was observed that the models gave better estimates and fit for the predatory mite compared to the springtail mite. In conclusion, both the distribution dependent and the distribution free methods were shown to be applicable to the estimation of count-based indices of aggregation.|Theses Collection|*||||||Olosunde, Akinlolu Adeseye|M|Some properties of even normal moment distribution and its application||||||M.Sc.

Somecharacterizations of the even normal moment distribution that gave relationships between it and some other known distributions were given. The method of cumulant generating function was used to obtained the rth moment. Tables of the cumulative distribution function were evaluated with the aid of computer software package called Mathematica. Characterizations were by the method of probability distribution function. Estimates of the parameters were by the method of maximum likelihood estimates.The application of the even normal moment distribution was considered in analyzing egg length data. It was observed that the even normal moment distribution gave smaller standard error when compared with those of the normal distribution for its flexibility.The study concluded that the even normal moment distribution provided a better fit to the data than the normal distribution for a particular choice of the shape parameter.|Theses Collection|*||||||Komolafe, Olufemi|M|The behaviour of solutions for non - linear differential equations from combustion theory||||||M.Sc.

The reaction-diffusion equations with and without non-linear diffusion coefficient for the concentration of one species in one spatial dimension with creation and annihilation terms were also considered and reaction-diffusion equations were converted to system of non-linear ordinary differential equation using suitable transformations.The stability analysis for the linear diffusion case (ä=0) gave rise to a stable node (origin) and saddle point (non-trivial critical point) while the corresponding special solutions gave rise to the wave speeds. In addition, for the non-linear diffusion case (ä? 0), I derived stable degenerate nodes for the origin and saddle points for the remaining two non-zero critical points. The corresponding special solutions obtained gave rise to the wave speed for linear diffusion case while for the non-linear case, it was found that there were three non-trivial stationary states leading to unstable (saddle point) and stable nodes with the condition µ> 4ö2The results obtained were in line with what others have observed with non-linear diffusion.

This will also give an insight into other uses of the compound.The lethal dose (LD50) of pure aridanin was evaluated by the administration of graded doses (25  100mg/kg) intraperitoncally (i.p.) to 4 groups of mice containing 6 mice each per group. Two sub-lethal doses (15 and 30 mg/kg) of aridanin were administered to groups of 6 mice and the animals observed for changes in general gross behaviour, such as rearing, grooming and scratching. Exploratory behaviours using head dipping method and motor co-ordination using rotarod and traction tests were also investigated. The analgesic activities of these doses were evaluated in mice treated with acetic acid. Hexobarbitone-induced sleeping time was assessed in 3 groups of mice that received aridanin 30 mins before hexobarbitone. Hypothermic effect of aridanin was examined by using a thermoprobe inserted 1.5 cm into the rectum of each mouse. Temperature was measured at 30 mins interval for 300 minutes after drug administration. This same analgesic and hypothermic activities were reevaluated by pretreating mice with naltrexone, cyproheptadine, atropine and haloperidol. The stereotypy effect of aridanin was examined iii mice induced by amphetamine and apomorphine respectively. The anticonvulsant activity was carried out using pentylenctetrazol, picrotoxin and strychnine induced convulsions.The LD50 was round to be 59 mg/kg showing that aridanin is toxic. However, sub-lethal doses showed significant analgesic activity using acetic acid-induced writhing in mice. Administration of naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist blocked the analgesic effect of aridanin, showing that the µ-receptors were involved in the effect. Aridanin also antagonized motor activity in mice and potentiated hexobabitone induced sleeping time. It also produced hypothermic effect in which aridanin was round to be mediated through cholinergic, serotonergic and opiate receptors. Aridanin suppressed clonic-tonic phase of convulsion and mortality induced by pentylenetetrazol. It however did not prevent the convulsive threshold induced by strychnine and picrotoxin. Aridanin reduced locomotor activity as shown in the reduction of exploratory behaviour and in the reduction of rearing, grooming and scratching behaviours in mice. Aridanin did not prevent the stereotype behaviour induced by apomorphine and amphetamine thus showing that it does not interfere with dopamine receptor that mediates is not involved in the stereotype behaviour. Aridanin did not cause ataxia and motor incoordination in mice.The study showed that aridanin had some neuropharmacological activities, which might be responsible for the use of the plant in the management of convulsion, pain and insomnia.|Theses Collection|*||||||Adeoye, Julius Olaniyi|M|The role of indigenous institutions in governance and development in Ile-Ife and Ifetedo communities of Osun State, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The study also identified the organizational structures of the major indigenous institutions in the two communities and assessed their contributions and constraints.Primary and secondary data were employed for the study. Structured questionnaires were administered on two hundred (200) of the eight hundred (800) literate respondents of the indigenous institutions in both communities using the population of the two communities, the number of respondents were drawn in the ratio 3 1 One hundred and fifty (150) respondents were drawn from Ile Ife and fifty (50) from Ifetedo. in Ile  Ife, the respondents were drawn as follows: from the Community Develoment Associations twenty one (21), the Market Women Association twenty one (21), the Informal Co-operative Thrift and Credit Societies thirty (30), Social Clubs and Professional Associations thirty nine (39) and the traditional chiefs thirty nine (39).In Ifetedo, the questionnaires were distributed as follows. the Community Development Associations seven (7), Market Women Associations seven (7); Informal Co-operative Thrift and Credit Societies ten (10), the Social Clubs and Professional Association thirteen (13) and thirteen (13) from the traditional chiefs. In addition, oral interviews were carried out with one hundred (100) leaders of indigenous institutions in IleIfe and Ifetedo communities in the ratio 3:1 of seventy-five (75) persons and twenty-five (25) persons respectively. Secondary data for the study were sourced from relevant official documents and community records.The study showed that numerous indigenous institutions existed in the two communities. The institutions included Social Clubs, Market Women/Men Associations, Chieftaincy institutions and informal economic institutions. The study found out that indigenous institutions played_ dominant role in the governance and social-economic development of the two communities, especially in the areas of dispute settlement, provision of security and facilities such as community halls, health centres, market stalls and court halls. The findings also showed that there existed complementary roles between the indigenous institutions and the state administration in the two communities. The study further revealed that the indigenous institutions in the two communities were faced with numerous problems. These problems included the weakening of traditional authorities by the state institutions (10%); dispute over succession to traditional chieftaincy titles and socio-cultural headship (1O%)., finance (30%) and the recent Ife/Modakeke communal feud (50%) The study also revealed that there were relationships between the historical, social-cultural, economic and political activities in the two communities as confirmed by 90% of the leaders of indigenous institutions interviewed.The study concluded that collaborative efforts between the state-based institutions and the indigenous institutions have great potentials to facilitate good governance and development in Ile-Ife and Ifetedo communities.|Theses Collection|*||||||Farinde, Kemi Feyisayo|F|The Isolation.Fractionation and characterization of polysaccharides of Cissus Adenocaulis.Steud||||||M.sc( Biochemistry)|O.O Oyedapo||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,Biochemistry|2004|||OAU|||||xv,96p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The polysaccharide was fractionated into four fractions by selective precipitation with Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The homogeneity of each fraction was tested by gel filtration on Sepbadeu G-100. The colorimetric method based on phenol/sulphuric acid reaction was employed to estimate the total sugar while phenol/folin reaction was used to estimate the total protein in the crude and the four CTAB fractions. Hydrolysis of polysaccharide was carried out with 6N HCl and individual sugar (fucose, hexose, hexosamine) in the hydrolysate was estimated. Thin layer chromatography was employed to separate and identify the individual sugar that was present in the polysaccharide and to confirm the homogeneity of the four fractions obtained by CTAB fractionation. The biological properties were investigated by determining the haemolytic and immunostimulating activities of the polysaccharide of Cissus adenocaulis.The results revealed that the polysaccharide from the stem and root of Cissus adenocaulis was a glycoprotein. It was adjudged to be a   heteropolysaccharide by thin layer chromatography. Cethyltrimethylammonium bromide fractionated the polysaccharide into neutral, basic and acidic sugars. The test of homogeneity of each fraction by gel filtration gave a single peak for each fraction implying homogeneity, which was further confirmed by thin layer chromatography. The identification of the individual sugar in the polysaccharide revealed that glucose, galacturonic acid and galactosamine were present. Furthermore, studies on the biological properties of the polysaccharide revealed that it had antihaemolytic and non-immunogenic activities.In conclusion, the results suggested that the polysaccharide from Cissus adenocaulis was a heteropolysaccharide that had antihaemolytic as well as non-immunogenic properties.|Theses Collection|*||||||Aransiola,Elizabeth Funmilayo|F|A Study of the Batch and Fed-batch cultivation of baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae from cassava Hydrolysates||||||M.Sc(Chemical Engineering)|B.O Solomon||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,Chemical Engineering|2004|||OAU|||||xvi,124p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The hydrolysates were used for the aerobic cultivation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae separately under batch and fed-batch conditions. The batch runs were carried out over a 48 h period while the fed-batch runs were programmed through the feed rates to last for 24 h each. All the runs were carried out under an aeration rate of 2 vvm (volume of air per volume of medium per minute) and agitation rate of 600 rpm at 30°C. Samples were withdrawn at regular intervals and analyzed for biomass, reducing sugar and ethanol concentrations. Analyses of the data obtained were carried out using mathematical models based on the concept of specific rates, material and energy balances and available electrons.The percent starch hydrolysis, based on reducing sugar concentration measurements, during acid only, acid-enzyme and enzyme-enzyme methods of hydrolysis were 63%, 76% and 87.3% respectively. The results obtained during batch cultivation also revealed that out of these three hydrolysates, enzyme-enzyme gave the best yield of 0.482 g biomass /g glucose. In the batch processes, biomass and ethanol concentrations increased with fermentation time while the residual reducing sugar decreased with time however in the fed-batch processes, biomass, reducing sugar as well as ethanol concentrations increased with fermentation time. The highest ethanol and biomass yields obtained from batch method were 0.212 g-ethanol/ g glucose and 0.482 g-biomass/ g glucose while that of fed-batch processes were 0.060 g ethanol/ g glucose and 0.508 g biomass/g glucose.From the results it was concluded that the enzyme enzyme method of cassava starch hydrolysis was the best of the three methods investigated and the fed-batch cultivation method recorded the higher biomass yield as well as the lower ethanol yield. This made it the better method for cultivating baker's yeast.|Theses Collection|*||||||Olawode, Emmanuel Oladayo|M|Isolation of the Hypoglycaemic constituents of Stachytarpheta Cayennensis (L.C Rich)Vahl Leaf (Verbenaceae)||||||M.Sc(Pharmacognosy)|C.A Adebajo||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,Pharmacognosy|2004|||OAU|||||xvii,108p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

C. Rich) Vahl (Verbenaceae) as antidiabetic, and to identify the active constituents of the plant.Fresh and dried plant materials were extracted at room temperature with water and methanol respectively. The methanolic extract was subjected to standard phytochemical analysis to determine the secondary metabolites. Twelve wister rats were divided into 4 groups. The first group was not made diabetic and served as the normal control while the other were made diabetic by intraperitoneal administration of alloxan and fasted for 18 hrs. The second group was administered 15ml/kg (137mg/kg) of the aqueous infusion orally while the third group was given glibenclamide (5mg/kg) and served as positive control. The last group had 10% saline and was the negative control. The blood glucose level obtained from the tail vein was measured using a glucometer. The experiment was repeated with more groups of diabetic rats to which graded doses of the methanolic extract were administered and compared with controls to determine the effective dose.The methanolic extract was thereafter partitioned successively into ethylacetate, n-butanol and water. Their blood glucose lowering activities of each fraction as outlined above was determined. The active butanol fraction was further tested at 2g/kg on group of normal fasted rats with control groups given 10% saline (normal fasted) and 10g/kg oral glucose load (glucose-induced hyperglycaemic) respectively in another experiment. The active butanol fraction was thereafter subjected to a bioactivity directed fractionation using vacuum liquid, column and preparative thin layer chromatographic methods. The resulting sub-fractions were also tested on alloxan diabetic rats for activity. In addition, the insulin secretory potentials of these extracts and fractions were determined in in-vitro insulin secretory cell culture (INS-1 cells), The aqueous and methanolic extracts gave reduced blood sugar after 4hrs significant at (P<0.02 and 0.025 respectively). These activities were similar to that of glibenclamide (5mg/kg) used as positive control. This activity was retained in the butanol fraction after fractionation of the methanolic extract. This activity was confirmed in another experiment using normal and glucose-induced hyperglycaemic rats. The vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) of the active butanol fraction gave several subfractions which when tested showed that a sample possessed hyperglycaemic while another has hypoglycaemic activities at the dose of 1 g/kg orally at 4hr. The methanolic extract stimulated secretion in the cell culture and this activity was also retained in the butanol fraction. A sample of the subfraction also gave this activity. The ethylacetate and aqueous fractions however inhibited insulin secretion in the cells. The results of the phytochemical screening of the methanolic extract showed the presence of steroids, terpenes, flavonoids, saponins and tannins in the leaf. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the extracts of S. cayennensis contained hypoglycaemic constituent(s) which were located as part of the polar constituents of the plant which justified the ethnomedical use of the plant in the management of diabetes. |Theses Collection|*||||||Omisore, Olumide Goriola|M|The Microbial flora and Physio - chemical charateristics of the Obafemi Awolowo University oxidation pond and it's impact on the receiving water||||||M.Sc(Microbiology)|I.F Adeniyi//P.O Olutiola||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Microbiology|2004|||OAU|||||xv,101p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The study spanned from August 1999 through January 2000, covering both the rainy season and dry season of the annual cycle. The major objective of the study was to assess the efficiency of the oxidation ponds (which were established about three decades ago and were not dislodged regularly) and microbial flora species associated with the effluent stream.Fourteen sampling sites were chosen to represent the eight habitats covered. The habitat included the unimpacted section of the receiving stream (three sites), the impacted section of the receiving stream (5 sites), influent wastewater (I site), ponds effluent discharge (2 sites), unimpacted section of Opa River (1 site) and impacted section of Opa River (2 sites). The physico-chemical parameters of the samples investigated were: oxygen parameters (dissolved oxygen, percent oxygen saturation and biochemical oxygen demand), major cations (calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium), major anions (chloride, sulphate and total alkalinity), nutrients (phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, silicate and organic matter), physical parameter, (temperature, turbidity, solids and flow discharge) as well as pH and conductivity. Samples were collected from each sampling site fortnightly and altogether one hundred and forty samples (140) samples were collected over the six months period. All field determinations and laboratory analyses carried out were according to standard methods. Total bacteria, coliform and heterotrophic fungi counts were carried out and the microbial species associated with the effluent stream identified using cultural, morphological and biochemical characteristics. The relationship between investigated sites with regard to their physico-chemical properties and microbial fauna were analysed using various statistical tests including descriptive statistics, linear regression analysis, correlation analysis, cluster analysis and factor analysis (using appropriate software on personal computer). Seven parameters (turbidity, conductivity, alkalinity, sulphate, oxygen saturation, BOD and phosphate) had efficiency greater than 50% in the rainy season while dry season recorded efficiency greater than 50% in 14 parameters (turbidity, TS, conductivity, Ca Na, K, total alkalinity, CI, SO4, DO, Oxygen saturation, BOD, NH3, and PO4). The t-test analyses between the impacted and unimpacted sections of both the effluents receiving stream and Opa River showed no significant difference (P < 0.05).   The microbial load was generally high. The total coliform count in the influent ranged from 4.8 x 105 to 6.5 x 108, the count being higher during the rainy season. Also the total coliform bacteria ount in the effluent discharge from Pond 1 was higher than that in Pond II. The total heterotrophic count of the sewage was found to range between 1.8 x 10 6 and 2.1 x 1010. The fungal load was low with a mean value of 4.8 x 102. Bacteria isolated include Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes while fungi isolates were Aspergillus niger, Mucor mucedo and Penicillum camemberti.  In conclusion, the study established the fact that proper assessment of the oxidation pond and its environs needs to be carried out and models which will help predict volume of discharge at any particular time developed. |Theses Collection|*||||||Agboola, Olubunmi Isaiah|M|Phytochemical Evaluation of selected Nigerian plants used in the control of the Larvae of Aedes Aegypti Linn Mosquito||||||M.Sc(Pharmacognosy)|A.A Gbolade||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,Pharmacy|2004|||OAU|||||ix,72p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Twelve different plants were selected based on factors that included ethno medicinal use as repellents and in the treatment of skin infections. They were screened for larvicidal activity using the 4`h Instar larvae of A. aegypti and the lethal concentrations (LC50) calculated. Three candidate plants with LC50 of less than 5mg/ml considered as strong larvicides were subjected to phytochemical screening and activity-directed fractionation using various chromatographic systems to isolate the active compounds.Out of the 12 plants screened, Harungana madagascariensis, Pseudocedrela kotschyi and Pycnanthus angolensis were highly larvicidal (LC50 0.5mg/ml), Allanblackia floribunda, Alafia barteri, Hyptis suaveolens and Sphenocentrum jollyanum were moderately larvicidal (LC50 5-10mg/ml), while Bidens pilosa, Colocasia esculentus, Deterium senegalensis, Euphorbia hirta and Hymenocardia acida had no appreciable larvicidal activity (LC50>10mg/ml). Solvent partitioning of the three most active plants led to the location of larvicidal activity in the ethyl acetate fractions for H. madagascriensis and P. kotschyi, while that of P. angolensis was found in the butanol fraction. Two biologically active components were isolated from P. kotschyi with LC50 of 0.16mg/ml and 1.24mg/ml respectively. H. madagascariensis gave one isolate with LC50 < 1.0 mg/ml while P. angolensis was not investigated further. The study concluded that these three plants H. madagascriensis, P. kotschyi, and P.angolensis contained components that can be considered as potential larvicides.|Theses Collection|*||||||Ojeniyi, Olufunke Oyejoke|F|A Study on the Development of an Automated Herbarium Data Bank||||||M.Sc(Computer Science)|J.O Omolehin//O Taiwo||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University,Computer Science|2004|||OAU|||||xiii,146p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Permanent sample plots of 25 by 25 m each were laid out randomly in the reserve. Data on both vegetation and soil were collected using semi-systematic sampling method. From the primary data collected, community and species attributes were assessed. The vegetation and soil data were subjected to canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) using CANOCO version 3.12 model. The reproductive phenologies of the target species were assessed monthly for two years. Minimum Viable Populations (MVP) was estimated for Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii. Quantitative Ethnobotany was carried out in the Walsh System plots (WSP). Some propagation experiments were carried out on the plants studied. The Hawthorne technique was adopted to prepare the ecological profiles of target species. A Species Profile (SPECPROF) database in Microsoft Windows environment was developed for indexing the species.Results showed that cation exchange capacity (CEC), phosphorus, sand content, percentage base saturation (PBS) and pH were the main factors determining the distribution of species in the reserve. Out of the 132 plant species in 39 families identified, 46 plants in 19 families occurred in the Strict Nature Reserve (SNR), 49 plants in 21 families occurred in the SNR buffer (SNR-B), 75 plants in 30 families plus two unidentified plants occurred in the Biosphere Extension Area (BEA), while 65 plants in 25 families plus three unidentified were recorded in the WSP plots. Eighteen species were common to all the sites; 10 were peculiar to SNR, 8 to SNR-B, 29 to BEA and 17 to WSP. Flowering and fruiting periods of the target species were cyclic. Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii, Irvingia gabonensis and Xylopia aethiopica have well defined, predictable reproductive periods each year while Carpolobia lutea, Sphenocentrum jollyannum and Spondias mombin flower and fruit either irregularly or continuously throughout the year. An MVP of 6040 ha-' (5032 males and 1008 females) was estimated for Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii.Approximately 88.24% of the species in the ethnobotanical plot were utilised. The target species were used in the treatment of many ailments; Carpolobia lutea, Myrianthus arboreus, Sphenocentrum jollyanum, Spondias mombin and Tetrapleura tetraptera treated the greatest number of ailments. Light inhibits the seed germination of Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii, which is overcome by gibberellic acid application. SPECPROF database to index the species in the reserve has been developed. It may be concluded that moderate innovative anthropogenic disturbances like occasional early burning and systematic harvesting of NTFPPs could be applied to specific sites in the Biosphere Reserve, in order to release nutrients locked up in the forest litter, conserve biodiversity and manage the reserve sustainably. Management strategies that will maintain its populations above 6040 ha-1 in the ratio of 5 males to 1 female could attain successful conservation of Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii.|Theses Collection|*||||||Isafiade, Adeniyi Jide|M|Simulation of the fate of liquefied natural gas spillage on water in the Niger Delta||||||M.Sc.

It was hypothesized that areas downwind of the spill point constituted the Area of Concern (AOC) since LNG is flammable within 5% to 15% concentration in air. In the event of a spill, this work identified the duration for which the vaporized natural gas/air mixture remained within the flammable range in those areas. Also the linear range (distance of impact) of these AOC and indoor concentrations of the vaporized gas were determined. Simulations were carried out to determine the vaporization rate of spilled liquefied natural gas from the spread. heat flux and vaporization model equations describing the phenomena occurring. The atmospheric dispersion of the vaporized gas was predicted using dense gas dispersion models such as ALOHA (Aerial Location of Hazardous Atmospheres) and HEGADAS (Heavy Gas Dispersion from Area Sources).ALOHA and HEGADAS predicted the downwind distance travelled by the vaporized natural gas cloud in agreement of 0.5% - 50%. It was predicted that the duration for a flammable natural gas vapour cloud to reach the AOC in the event of the rupture of a full tank load (14,500,000kg) of LNG would be 22 minutes, while smaller spilled masses require shorter times. The indoor concentrations predicted ranged between 1,530ppm and 7,350ppm which were below the flammability range of methane as well as the concentration that can asphyxiate exposed individuals or cause freeze burns.In conclusion, a distance of 5.5km was the minimum distance between Bonny river and the AOC, in order to avoid the LNG vapour cloud getting to these Areas of Concern.|Theses Collection|*||||||Dosumu, Oluwayemisi Adebunmi|F|Bacterial contamination of wounds among orthopaedic patients at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife||||||M.Sc.

The in-vitro antibiotic susceptibility profiles of predominant isolates were also carried out.The patients screened were those who were hospitalized at the orthopaedic wards of the hospital and the criteria for their inclusion were determined by the attending clinician. All samples were collected by the attending physician and introduced into Thioglycolate broth and transferred to the laboratory for analysis.After 24 hours incubation of each culture at 37°C, a loopful of each was streaked onto differential and selective media, eosin methylene blue and mannitol salt agar plates respectively. Colonies that grew on such media were studied and further characterized by standard bacteriological methods.Altogether, a total of 126 bacterial isolates were recovered from ninety-six specimens, averaging (0.76) bacteria per sample. The prevalence of orthopaedic infection was highest among long bones (78.1%). Gram positive organisms constituted 58.7% of which 79.7% were cocci. Of these 55 isolates (93.2%) were staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 51%. Other Gram positive rods encountered were Bacillus sp. and Corynebacterium sp. both accounting for 20.3% of the Gram positive isolates.Gram negative rods accounted for 40.4% of total isolates with Pseudomonas aeruginosa predominating (26.9%), followed by Klebsiella oxyotoca (17.3%) and Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis  being 13.5% and 11.5% respectively. Other Gram negative rods recovered were Aeromonas sp. (7.7%) Alcaligens faecalis (5.8%).Most of the bacterial isolates were resistant to the antimicrobials used with some isolates resistant to as many as eight different antibiotics. The study concluded that orthopaedic wounds are colonized by different microflora with Staphylococci being predominant. The multiple antibiotic resistance profile of the isolates suggested that improved chemotherapeutic evaluation scheme be put in place to monitor orthopaedic patients in the event of ineffectiveness of antimicrobial therapy as a result of high incidence of resistance recorded amongst these isolates.|Theses Collection|*||||||Elurele, Anthony Olurotimi|M|Antibiotic sensitivity patterns of staphylococcus aureus carried in the anteriornares of school children in Ile-Ife||||||M.Sc.

The link between the incidence of carriage and wound infections prevalent among the school children in some parts of the study area, the antibiotic susceptibility patterns to some of the most frequently used antibiotics and the frequency of antibiotic resistance of the isolated strains of the organism were also determined.One hundred and eighty pupils were screened for Staphylococcus aureus  using nasal swab specimens obtained by swabbing the left and the right anterior nares of pupils with sterile dry cotton-wool swabs, subcultured on plates of mannitol salt agar and the isolates confirmed to be Staphylococcus aureus by carrying out a few biochemical tests diagnostic for Staphylococcus aureus. The susceptibility and resistance of the strains to antibiotics were determined using the standard disc diffusion method on diagnostic sensitivity test agar.A total of 102 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were obtained giving an overall carriage rate of 56.7% with a higher rate of 54.9% among females as against 45.1% in males. Ninety-nine percent of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus  produced DNAase. Of the thirty-four pupils examined who had wounds, 32, that is, 94.1% carried Staphylococcus aureus in their anterior nares. The anterior nares of humans, especially young children appear to be a good habitat for Staphylococcus aureus, probably because of nasal secretions in these children and other environment factors e.g. race.Ninety-nine percent of the strains were resistant to amoxycillin, 92.2% to cloxacillin,  95.1% to augmentin, 38.2% to tetracycline 20.6% to erythromycin, 13.7% to cotrimoxazole, 8.8% to chloramphenicol and 2.9% to gentamicin.In conclusion, the high carriage rate and the resistance of most of the isolates to commonly used antibiotics constitute a threat to health, most especially the health of the population groups in the study area. It is therefore suggested that efforts should be made, through public enlightenment programmes put in place by governments at all levels and the strict maintenance of good personal hygiene at all times by the populace, to minimize nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus in the community.|Theses Collection|*||||||Ebehikhalu, Nicholas Osagie|M|The impact of infracstructural facilities on the development of rural areas of Esan community, Edo State, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The specific objectives of the study include the examination of the pattern of distribution of infrastructural facilities, the level of accessibility of the respondents to the infrastructures and the role the infrastructure play in generating development in rural areas of Esan Community. The data for the study include primary and secondary data. The primary data were collected through the administration of questionnaire to heads of households in the study area. A total of 399 heads of households in the twenty-eight sampled rural settlements were served with questionnaires. Tables and charts were used to summarize and analyze the relationship between the density and distribution of infrastructure and their usage by the inhabitants. Chi-square and Spearman's rank correlations were used to analyze the accessibility of the respondents to the facilities, the quality and importance of each of the infrastructure to the socio-economic development of the rural areas. The result of the analysis showed that the infrastructural facilities available in rural areas of Esan Community are predominantly poor and inadequate. The study revealed that the condition of the roads to the facilities is in bad state and about 88% of the roads are unsurfaced and badly affected by erosion during the rainy season. Many farmers have suffered loss of farm products due to bad roads and moreover, patients and pregnant women have suffered loss of energy while traveling on the bad roads to health facilities. The study also found that most of the infrastructures are inaccessible because of the long distance the respondents have to cover before reaching the facilities. It was found that the action space of the people is greater than the spatial feature of all the rural facilities but more pronounced, in particular, for Banking facilities (62%), Hospitals (46%), Primary Health Centres (46%) and Maternities (41%) which are pressing needs of the people. All these represent low welfare in the rural areas of Esan Community. In order to address identified problems, it is suggested that existing policies on rural development should be reviewed. An important strategy in this direction is the need to strengthen the depth of works in every local government council of Nigeria and, the reformation of Directorate of Food, Road and Rural Infrastructure (DFRRI). Through these policies, government can provide enough infrastructural facilities that can raise the welfare of people in the rural areas of Esan Community and similar rural-areas  across the country.|Theses Collection|*||||||Ayoola, Shakirudeen Akinwunmi|M|Impact of occupational stress on performance in textile industry in Lagos State||||||M.Sc.

The objectives of the study were to examine the impact of stress on workers' performance in textile mills in Lagos; assess whether or not organizational support can help reduce the effect of stress on workers; and determine occupational policies that can reduce stress to enhance performance. This work was carried out in three Textile Mills from Local Government areas in Lagos State namely, Afprint Nigeria Plc.(Isolo-Oshodi LG), Enpee Industrial Plc.(Mushin LG) and Nigeria Textile Mills Plc.(Ikeja LG).Purposive sampling technique was used to select a sample of one hundred and fifty textile  workers from the three Mills. Data were collected through the use of questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews. Data collected from the questionnaire were analyzed descriptively with the c of frequency counts and percentages with various tabulations. The Z-Y index analysis table as used to present the response from the in-depth interview. The study revealed that 73.56% of the workers were of the view that stress is work-related. Besides, about 47.14% and 43.58% of respondents identified the bulk of work and nature of the job respectively as factors responsible for stress. About 80.71% confessed experiencing illness in one form or the other. Performance under stressful situation according to 55% of the respondent was relatively low and capacity utilization of textile mills concerned was grossly below average. The study showed that where there was stress, performance was less likely to appreciate.The findings revealed that none of the different policies used by the management stood out as the most important instrument to combat stress as 55.72% of the respondents, affirmed that there was no support to this effect, although in some mills investigated, clinics were attached to attend to stress occurrence, however, it was evident that most workers preferred stress free working environment to the palliative treatment being given them.The study affirmed that when workers were supported at the imminent of stress performance was less likely to improve. Thus support correlated negatively with performance.In conclusion, stress impact negatively on workers' performance in textile mills in Lagos and the organizational support given to workers is not enough to make for a stress free working environment|Theses Collection|*||||||Adetunji, Oluwasegun Adeyinka|M|An investigation of the effects of gamma irradiation on the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosics of softywood and hardwood origins||||||M.Sc.

The effects of gamma irradiation on hydrolysis of sawdust were evaluated using statistical methods (ANOVA and T-test) and the kinetics of the hydrolysis studied. Pretreatments employed to enhance the susceptibility of sawdust to enzymatic attack included ballmilling, varied irradiation dosage level and treatment with caustic swelling. The hydrolysis was carried out at a slurry concentration of 2.5% in 0.05M-phosphate buffer at pH 5.0 and temperature of 45°C. Photomicrographs of Tangential Longitudinal Section with macerated fibres of the soft and hard woods were taken. The reducing sugar concentration was measured by the Dinitrosalicylic acid method of Miller.The results showed that most of the fibres of Khaya senegalensis were moderately short and prominent, with pointed ends. They also exhibited light gray tone colour characteristics with toludiene blue stain in one percent aqueous solution indicating less lignification while some of the fibres of Triplocliton scleroxylon were moderately long but also with pointed ends, and displayed a gray colour characteristic of lignification. This may be responsible for the observed susceptibility of the Hardwood (Khaya senegalensis) to pretreatment. Analysis of variance revealed that maximum digestibility occurred in softwood at 40kGy dosage level, while it occurred at 90kGy dosage level for irradiated hardwood. The T-test also showed that hardwood hydrolyzed significantly compared with softwood irradiated at the same dosage levels at p <_ 0.05. The mean conversion of cellulose into reducing sugar after hydrolysis for 8 hours at 45°C was found to be 2.33% and 5.77% for unirradiated and irradiated softwood sawdust and 2.24% and 6.42% for the unirradiated and irradiated hardwood sawdust respectively.The study concluded that irradiated softwood was more amenable to enzymatic hydrolysis than unirradiated hardwood; however gamma irradiation had more significant effect on the hydrolyzability of hardwood.|Theses Collection|*||||||Omotoso, Oluwakemi Modupe|F|Policewomen's perceptions of the Nigeria Police as an organisation||||||M.Sc.

It investigated the experiences of policewomen with regard to role conflicts in carrying out their official assignments and their roles as mothers and wives within the organisation. It also evaluated their career prospects in the force.The data were collected from Oyo State Police Command. The sample size comprised 142 policewomen out of 566 policewomen, which is about 25% of the total policewomen in the state. Stratified random technique was used to select the targeted subjects. Administration of questionnaires and in-depth interview method were used to collect data from the respondents. The data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics.The study showed that majority (81.3%) of the junior policewomen officers neither perceived nor experienced discrimination in the force, while majority (83.3%) of the senior policewomen officers perceived discrimination and believed that they were experiencing discrimination in the force. The senior policewomen officers believed their male colleagues were more favoured during promotion exercises than their female counterparts. Majority (73.3%) of the junior policewomen perceived no limitations in their career prospects, while the majority (83.3%) of the senior policewomen officers perceived some limitations in their career prospects. The senior policewomen officers believed that their male colleagues were posted to positions of higher responsibilities than their female counterparts. Majority (87.1%) of the married policewomen officers experienced role conflicts in carrying out their official assignments with their roles as mothers and wives. They complained of working at odd hours and not having enough time to take care of their families. Majority (73.3%) of the policewomen perceived sexual harassment by their male counterparts and majority (84%) of the policewomen perceived indiscriminate transfer of married policewomen as some peculiar problems faced by policewomen in the force. The policewomen believed that they could be subjected to threats of transfer and or queries if they fail to cooperation with their superior male officers' sexual advances.The study concluded that majority of the policewomen in the Oyo State Police Command did not perceive any discrimination in the force and majority of the policewomen perceived future prospects for career advancement in the organisation. Educational status and length of service of the policewomen appeared to have influenced the perceptions of the policewomen about gender discrimination in the force.|Theses Collection|Police/gender discrimination/policewomen/The Nigerian Police Force/favourotism/sexual harassment/transfer/queries/career advancement *||||||Akinyele, Olurotimi Samson|M|The development of a scale for the measurement of successful aging in south western Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Psycology|Funmi Togonu - Bickersteth||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Psycology|2004|||OAU|||||xii,137p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

In achieving this objective, the study was also designed to identify the correlates and meaning of successful aging as perceived by elderly people in Southwestern Nigeria and to assess the impact of key social-economic factors (that is, education and occupational status) on successful aging.The study was carried out in three phases. The first two phases constituted the pre-standardizations study while the third phase constituted the standardizations or the validation study. Phase I of the study involved the generation of an item pool for the proposed Successful Aging Scale (SAS). The research process employed in this phase yielded an item pool of 57 statements measuring the identified predictors of successful aging. The second phase of the study involved the selection of items to be included in the final form of the SAS from the item pool generated in phase I. Statistical analysis based on mean and modal ranking values of these statements or items by some selected elderly subjects resulted in a 26-item scale with the items representing all the identified predictors of successful aging. The third phase of the study was designed to establish psychometric properties in terms of reliability and validity for the SAS. The validation exercise of this phase involved six hundred elderly subjects (286 males and 314 females) aged 60 years and above drawn from Osun, Ondo, and Oyo states. The World Health Organisation Quality of Life Scale ( WHOQOL - BREF) and the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) were used in validating the SAS.The findings showed that the scale had adequate psychometric properties. Specifically, the scale was found to have split-half reliability coefficient of 0.70 for Guttman and 0.71 for Spearman Brown. Additional measure of internal consistency for the scale yielded an alpha coefficient of 0.77. The scale was also assessed to have convergent and construct validity. Statistical analysis revealed that successful aging (as measured by the SAS) was significantly related to life satisfaction at old age based on a correlation coefficient of 0.684 at p = 0.01 obtained between subjects' total scores on the SAS and the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). It was also observed that while occupation and educational level significantly affected subjects' total scores on the SAS, marital status and sex did not have any significant effect on subjects' total scores on the SAS. Possible reasons for these findings were given.The study concluded that it is possible to develop and validate a psychological scale for the measurement of successful aging in Southwestern Nigeria and that there was the need for further empirical evidence regarding the observed relationship between occupation and subjects' total scores on the SAS.|Theses Collection|Aging/Successful Aging Scale (SAS)/education/occupation/psychometric properties/World Health Organisation Quality of Life Scale ( WHOQOL - BREF)/Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS)/Spearman Brown*||||||Adedokun, Sikiru Adetona|M|Fiscal federalism: issues of equity and efficiency in revenue allocation in Nigeria (1981 - 2000)||||||M.Sc.

The study was motivated by the need to proffer solution to the recurring problems of revenue allocation criteria vis-a-vis its medium and long term negative effects on the nation's polity. Specifically, it examined the horizontal and vertical revenue allocations with respect to the principles of equity and efficiency. It also examined the institutional arrangements that could ensure the entrenchment of acceptable revenue sharing formula in the country.The study employed non-parametric method using eleven models two of which were the principal equations: TCPij >TRPij = 0 and SMBik = NAVik. TCPij was the Tax Contribution Proportion of State i in year j, TRPij was the Tax Revenue Proportion of State i in year j, SMB denoted the Sum of the Marginal Benefit of level of government k in year i and NAVik represented the National Average Cost of level of government k in year i. Tables of ratios, percentages and graphs were used to show the distributions of revenues from the Federation Account and how the distributions had addressed the principles of equity and efficiency in line with the models. The data were sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria's Statistical Bulletin, the Accountant General of the Federation's Reports and the classified information file of the Federal Ministry of Finance.In the case of equity in horizontal revenue allocation it was found that allocations at this level had not been in line with equity criteria. It was only in seven (7) of the twenty (20) years of study that equity principle was adhered to and even during those years it was not a general application in that very few states had what was due to them. Some state, notably, Bauchi, Niger, Sokoto, Katsina, Taraba, Ekiti and Zamfara to mention but a few recorded negative residuums while some others, notably, Cross River, Imo, Rivers, Delta, Edo and Bayelsa recorded positive residuum. This was not unconnected with weights attached to population and landmass in the horizontal revenue allocation formulae.The study also showed that the pattern of revenue sharing exhibited at the vertical level was that of federal dominance resulting in dependence of the lower levels of government on the federal government for substantial proportion of the revenues for their needs. Expenditure and revenue decentralization ratios were found to be concentrated at the centre. Furthermore, the degree of decentralization of revenues was (95.16 percent) higher than the degree of decentralization of expenditures (72.01 percent) for the federal government. The reverse was found to be the case for the lower levels of government in Nigeria. The states had 20.78 percent degree of decentralization of expenditures and 4.28 percent degree of decentralization of revenues while the local governments had 7.22 and 0.56 percents respectively. Besides, the federal government recorded an average financial autonomy ratio of 129.25 percent as against 24.21 percent and 8.04 percent recorded by the states and local governments respectively. The study concluded that both horizontal and vertical revenue allocations had not met either the equity or efficiency criterion in Nigeria. If not addressed these may impair the fiscal relation in the federation. |Theses Collection|Fiscal federalism/equity/revenue allocation/ revenue sharing formula/Tax Contribution Proportion/Tax Revenue Proportion/Marginal Benefit/National Average Cost/Federation Account/Central Bank of Nigeria's Statistical Bulletin   *||||||Amoo, Stephen Oluwaseun|M|Investigation of callus production and plant regeneratiopn in epicotyl, cotyledon and hypocotyl tissues of young seedlings of locust bean parkiaa biglobosa (JACQ.) benth||||||M.Sc.

The objectives were to establish the requirements for survival of Parkia tissues in vitro and to investigate the effects of changing hormonal concentration on the callogenic and regenerative capacities of different explants from young Parkia seedlings.Explants of epicotyl, cotyledon and hypocotyl of 7-day old seedlings aseptically germinated were surface-sterilized in 100ml of 2.5% NaOCl + 2 drops of Tween 20 per 100ml for 5, 15 and 25 minutes and then cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. This medium was  supplemented with different concentrations of auxins (Naphthalene acetic acid and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) for callus induction. Cotyledon explants were placed either with the abaxial surface facing down or up on the medium. Induced calli were subcultured on media containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid combined separately with kinetin or 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP).The best sterilization of the explants from aseptically germinated seedlings was achieved in the treatment for 25 minutes. Calli were successfully induced from epicotyl and hypocotyl explants cultured on MS medium supplemented with either Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) or 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) concentrations, ranging between 0.4mg/l and 1.0mg/l. Cotyledon explants showed callus production when cultured on medium supplemented with 2,4-D alone, whereas no callus was formed with the NAA concentrations investigated. Callus production was observed only at the cut edges and on the abaxial surface of cotyledon explants. In both hypocotyl and cotyledon explants, callus production decreased with increased concentration of 2,4-D. Callus production from epicotyl explants was affected by 2,4-D concentrations and incubation period. The induced calli turned friable and more nodular with small protuberances on the medium containing 2,4-D and kinetin. These protuberances eventually developed to somatic embryos in an auxin-free suspension culture medium. However, no organogenesis was observed from the induced calli. In conclusion, the study established the callogenic capacity of the epicotyl, cotyledon and hypocotyl explants of Parkia biglobosa. Somatic embryoids were also produced from the calli of these explants, thus establishing the potential to produce plantlets from these explants through somatic embryogenesis.|Theses Collection|*||||||Asani, M.

The choice of respondents was made through a process of random sampling while the CDAs included all the registered associations that could be located out of the 33 Associations in the government official register.The study showed that members of the CDAs contributed more than the government to the community development projects studied. About 42% of the respondents made financial contribution while others offered physical efforts in terms of labour (11%) and another 34% contributed financially. On the execution and financing of community projects, about 57% favoured Local Government, 33% favoured the CDAs as the preferred agents. This showed that people preferred the Local Government and CDAs to plan projects, the Federal Government to finance projects and Local Government, with the involvement of the CDAs, to execute the projects. About 93% of the respondents indicated that the CDAs were relevant while only 2% did not think so.The study also revealed that the major problem confronting CDAs was lack of government support with 62% of the respondents confirming this. Other factors such as illiteracy, poverty, culture and politics were also implicated in the problems of the CDAs.The study concluded that the participation of the target beneficiaries was very fundamental in achieving Sustainable Community Development Projects in Osogbo because the projects in which they participated enjoyed more patronage and were more sustainable than those in which they were not involved.|Theses Collection|Community development projects/availability of labour/funding/lack of governmantal support/illiteracy/poverty/politicking/culture *||||||Jiboye, Adesoji David|M|An assessment of the influence of socio- cultural factors on housing quality in Osogbo, Osun State, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

This research work aims at identifying some of these social and cultural parameters in housing, emphasizes their relative importance and influence on housing planning and provision in Osogbo.To achieve this goal, the following objectives have been identified namely to examine the housing quality, to explain the differences observable between one zone and the other, and to determine the relationship between housing quality and some socio-cultural factors in Osogbo. Primary data were collected through questionnaire administration by using the systematic sampling technique. Information on socio-economic and cultural characteristics as well as that of the perception of housing and environmental quality in Osogbo was supplied by household heads.Data were analysed using the statistical methods of frequency, cross tabulation as well as the one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The findings revealed that some socio-cultural factors as age, religion, marital status and household size among others, have significant influence on housing quality determinants in Osogbo. The study also revealed that the pattern of housing quality in Osogbo varies among the three zones identified. Arising from these findings, the study recommended that planners, designers, government and others concerned with housing provision and delivery in our societies should ensure that future housing designs and planning incorporate and embrace social and cultural values of the target population. In addition, the level of infrastructural facilities should be improved in the overall housing environment.

The objectives were to identify the socio  economics characteristics of plantain farmers, analyze the costs and returns to plantain production, predict the asymptotic distribution of plantain farm sizes and identify the problems associated with plantain production and measures put in place for solving the problems.The study covered two ecological zones within Osun state, namely the forest zone (Ife/Ijesa) and the derived savannah zone (Iwo). Two hundred plantain farmers were selected using a multi stage random sampling technique. Primary data collected with the aid of structured questionnaires for the 2001 / 2002 production season were analyzed using descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, budgetary techniques and Markov chain process. A comparison of the results of the two zones was undertaken.The results of the descriptive analysis showed that, (i) the modal level of education in Ife / Ijesa zone was primary education while it was tertiary in Iwo zone, (ii) all respondents in the study area grew more than one variety of plantains, 36.8 % of the respondents in Ife / Ijesa zone grew traditional "Agbagba" while only 17.1 % grew it in Iwo zone. Only 3.7 % and 14.2 % grew hybrid type plantain in Ife/Ijesa and Iwo zones, respectively, (iii) a larger proportion (72 %) of the farmers in Iwo zone adopted the recommended spacing of 3 m2 while only 50 % adopted same in Ife / Ijesa, (iv) it was found that capital, transportation and shortage of labour, in order of importance, were the most serious problems confronting plantain farmers in the study areas.Budgetary analysis results showed that it was profitable to embark on plantain production in the two zones but comparatively better in Iwo zone than in Ife / Ijesa zone. The analysis showed that the net return accruing to an average plantain farmer annually in Iwo zone (N102,126.04 ) was significantly higher than that in Ife / Ijesa zone (N 18,256.69). Markov chain analysis showed an upward trend in the sizes of plantain farms in Ife / Ijesa and Iwo zones until the year 2009 when equilibrium would be attained at about 1451 and 1960.5 plantain stands, respectively. The findings showed that plantain farmers in the study areas have a great potential to boost local production. Policies should therefore be directed towards increasing plantain production.

The aim was to to provide data needed for the evaluation of the occupational radiation exposure within Nigerian coal mining environments. Soil, coal and tailings obtained from the two functional coal mines in Enugu, Enugu State and Okaba, Kogi State were analyzed for their activity concentrations. Also analyzed was the coal ash (slag) obtained by ashing the coal samples separately. Background gamma terrestrial radiation levels in these mining environments were also measured using a portable gamma survey meter. The radionuclides detected in the samples belong to the series 238U, 232Th and the non-series 40K. Their activity concentrations range from 31.91± 3.72 to 36.82 ± 3.92 BqKg-1 for 214Bi, 39.80 ± 3.55 to 47.10 ± 4.21 for 214Pb, 20.36 ± 5.33 to 22.81± 5.97 208T1 and 283.09 ± 2.35 to 332.72 ± 2.78 for 40K. In the coal, the radionuclides detected include 214Bi (55.63 ± 16.25 to 87.80 ± 25.09)BqKg-1, 228Ac(20.92 ± 5.75 to 37.32 ± 10.21) BgKg-1 and 4°K(32.01 ± 8.70 to 52.19 ± 14.13) BqKg -1. Their corresponding activity concentration ranges in the ash samples are (269.00 ± 80.02 to 380.17 ± 107.67) BgKg-1, (622.69 ± 70.16 to 1302.89 ± 353.11) BgKg-1 and (329.46 ± 41.85 to 4955.15 ± 1422.12) BgKg-1. These estimates of the levels of radioactivity from the series nuclides in the Nigerian coal compare favourably with values obtained from other areas with similar mining activities. The dominance of the contribution of 40K to the radioactivity of the analyzed samples is .consistent with findings in the literature.The study further revealed that a mean outdoor absorbed dose rate of 30.55 ± 1.89 µGyh-' measured lm above the ground for these Nigerian coal mining environments falls within the existing global average value of 50µGyh-1. The respective percentage contributions of 238 U, 232 Th and 40K ( in soil) to this estimated mean are 33, 25 and 43%. Theses are consistent with the corresponding United nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic radiation, UNSCEAR documented estimates of 35, 25 and 40%.The annual dose equivalent to the coalmine workersas determined using the mean dose equivalent is 0.16µGyh-1. This value ia about 2/3 the value of the recommended permissible dose for the public from all radiation sources. Background gamma terrestial radiation in these environments ranges from 11.0 to 17.0 µGyh-1 indoors and 7.5 to 16.75 µGyh-1 outdoors on the mine surface as against a range of 13.0 to 20.5 µGyh-1 in the underground mine tunnel.In view of these findings, it is concluded that the radiation exposure in the Nigerian coal-mining environment is within the globally recommended limits hence the Nigerian coal miner and other workers within the coal minig environments need not be classifed as designated radiation workers. It is therefore recommended that the requirement for constant radiation and health monitoring is not applicable here.|Theses Collection|Radioactivity/coal mining/gamma spectroscopic method/radiation exposure/Nigeran coal mining environments/coal ash (slag)/gamma terrestrial radiation/radionuclides/gamma survey meter/United nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic radiation   *||||||Opabode, Jelili Titilola|M|Comparative morphology and physiology of two woody legumes, Leucaena  Leucocephala (LAM) de wit and Gliricidia  Sepium (JACQ) walp||||||M.Phil.

Walp cv. ILG50 at the early stages of growth (2-16 months after planting (MAP) ).The study was a single-factor experiment and the design was a randomized complete block with three replications. At monthly intervals after establishment, stem height, canopy diameter, stem diameter, number of branches, leaf area, chlorophyll content, chlorophyll stability index and nitrogen content were determined. Biomass yield, nodulation and growth estimates were also determined at 4, 8,12 and 16 MAP. Separate analysis of variance was performed on all parameters for each sampling date and means were separated at 5% level of probability using the Least Significant Difference (LSD).The establishments of L. leucocephala and G. sepium were 74% and 76% respectively at the end of the study. The two species had similar stem heights except at the early stage of growth (4-8 MAP) when that of G.sepium (1.55 m) was significantly (P<0.05) higher than that of L.leucocephala (0.85 m). Towards the end of the study (10-16 MAP), the stem diameter of G.sepium (0.05 m) was significantly (P<0.05) larger than that of L.leucocephala (0.04 m). Similarly, the canopy diameter of G.sepium (1.70 m) was significantly (P<0.05) larger than that of L.leucocephala (1.00 m) between 10 and 16 MAP. The leaf area of G.sepium (128.05 m2) was significantly (P<0.05) higher than that of L.leucocephala (70.10 m) between 14 and 16 MAP. Between 12 and 16 MAP, G.sepium (5.10 kg/plant) significantly (P<0.05) accumulated more biomass than L.leucocephala (1.35 kg/plant). The average plant growth rate (PGR) and relative growth rate (RGR) of G.sepium were 688.75 g/month and 1.97 g/g/month respectively between 12 and 16 MAP which were significantly (P<0.05) higher than those of L.leucocephala (PGR, 142.00 g/month; RGR, 1.56 g/g/month) at the same period. Net assimilation rate (NAR) of G.sepium (118.25 g/m2/month was significantly (P<0.05) higher than the NAR of L.leucocephala(40.84 g/m2/month). Between 4 and 8 MAP, leaf area ratio (LAR) of L leucocephala (0.09 m2/g) was significantly (P<0.05) higher than that of G.sepium (0.01 m2/g).The number of nodules produced by G.sepium (96.0/plant) were significantly (P<0.05) higher than in L.leucocephala (44.0/plant) between 8 and 16 MAP. At 12 and 16 MAP, leaf total chlorophyll content of G.sepium (6.12 µM/g) was significantly (P<0.05) higher than in L.leucocephala (4.12 µM/g). Significantly (p<0.05) higher nitrogen accumulation occurred in G. sepium (54.20 kg/plant) than in L. leucocephala (42.80 kg/plant) at 16 MAP.It was concluded from the study that G.sepium has higher productivity than L.leucocephala in terms of photosynthetic efficiency, biomass production and nodulation under field conditions.|Theses Collection|*||||||Ayorinde, Oludayo Festus|M|Achievement in mathematics as a correlate of mathematical language in selected secondary schools in Ife East Local Government Area of Osun State||||||M.A. Curriculum Studies|O.O.

It assessed the level of students' understanding of selected mathematical terminologies; compared the performance of students exposed to mathematical terminologies with those not exposed to them and determined the level of understanding of mathematical terminologies among male and female students.The design of the study was the pretest-posttest control group. The sample of the study was 120 senior secondary school two students (SSS2). Proportionate stratified random sampling technique was used to select them from a school in Ife East Local Government Area of Osun State. The average age of the students was seventeen. The experimental group was subjected to instruction in mathematical terminologies before actual teaching while the control group was subjected to conventional mathematics instruction only. The two groups were taught for six weeks at three hours per week. The researcher personally taught the students in both groups. The test items, which were administered before and the end of instruction to measure achievement on the topics contained the same questions but arranged in different order to give the students the impression that they were not the same. The performances of the students were analyzed using product moment correlation technique and t-test statistics.The result showed that exposure to mathematical terminologies improved the overall performance of the students (t =8.4045, df = 118, p < 0.05). Students exposed to mathematical terminologies performed better that those not exposed to them (t = 7.439, df = 118, p < 0.05). Results further showed that sex had no significant effect on students' performance in mathematics in the experimental group (t = 0.7694, df= 58, p <0.05) and in control group (t = 0.0158, df = 58, p<0.05).

Burm. F. was carried out. The microscopical parameters investigated included the characters of the lower and upper epidermal surfaces, tissue distribution in the transverse and longitudinal sections, quantitative analyses of the stomata and the epidermal cells and the measurement of their dimensions. The dried leaf powder of the two species was macerated with MeOH and CHCI3 to give their respective extracts. Phytochemical screening of the MeOH extracts of the two species was carried out. The exudates, gels and chloroform extracts of the two species were specifically evaluated for the presence of free and combined anthraquinone derivatives. They were further examined by analytical thin layer chromatography and their total anthraquinone content estimated spectrophotometrically at Xmax 520nm using aloe-emodin and aloin as reference standards. The amount read off the aloin standard curve represented the C-glycoside content while that of the aloe-emodin curve represented the total free and combined anthraquinone content.Aloe vera leaves were conspicuously smaller and markedly shorter than those of Aloe schweinfurthii. A. schweinfurthii leaves were greyish-green with a purple tinge on the upper surface but A. vera leaves are pea-green in colour with reddish tinge on upper surface. A. schweinfurthii have twice the number of stomata on the upper surface compared to A. vera Although it is fewer and scattered on its lower surface, it is still about twice that A. vera. The transverse section of the leaf of A. schweinfurthii is 14p compared to 9p of A. vera showing that A. schweinfuthii is thicker. Calcium oxalate and raphides were absent in the transverse section in A. schweinfurthii but needle-like calcium oxalate crystals abound in A. vera. In A. vera, the dimensions of the lower (55.2-131.1) x (48.3-69.0)p and upper epidermal (62.1-144.9) x (48.3-75.9)p cells and stomata (48.3-55.2) x (41.4-48.3)p are similar to that of A. schweinfurthii.Both Aloe species contain free and combined anthraquinones, starch, flavonoids, steroid and phenolic compounds. Thin layer chromatographic analysis in different solvent systems showed the presence of anthraquinone derivatives particularly aloin and aloe-emodin in the two species but A. schweinfurthii have more compound. A. schweinfurthii exudate has 1.21 % total free plus combined anthraquinones calculated as aloe-emodin, while Aloe vera exudate have 0.21%. The amount of combined anthraquinones in A. schweinfurthii was remarkably high (0.93%) when compared to 0.24% in A. vera.The study concluded that A. schweinfurthii contained more anthraquinones than A. vera and so can be used as a substitute. The macro- and micro-morphological data provided will be useful as descriptive standards for quality assurance in a local herbal pharmacopoeia. |Theses Collection|*||||||Akinyemi, Eyitayo Olufunmilayo|F|A study of children abandonment and adoption in Osun State 1991 - 2001||||||M.A. Adult Education|S.N.

The samples of the study were 200 respondents purposively selected from six Welfare Zones and they comprised 50 Nurses. 40 Social Welfare Officers. 29 couples and 81 individual adoptors. The instruments used for the study were "Children Abandonment and Adoption Questionnaire" (CAAQ) and oral interview. The questionnaire was self-developed and consisted of three sections: namely. the personal data of the respondents. respondent's views on children abandonment and adoption: and attitudes and views of the adoptors on the adoptees. Data were analysed using descriptive statistical procedures.The study revealed that the commonest causes of children abandonment by care givers were poverty of the parents who abandoned the children (53.5%). disease either of the abandoned child or the mother (7%). disability of the child (10%) and unwanted pregnancy (29.5%). Also the rate at which children were abandoned in the six Social Welfare Zonal Offices in the state differed. The number of abandoned children reflected the population of each of the zone with highly populated zones having more numbers of abandoned children. Between 1991 and 2001. 25 children were abandoned in Osogbo zone. 15 in Ile-Ife zone. 15 in Ilesa zone. 13 in Iwo zone. 10 in Ikirun zone and throe in Ede zone. These children were abandoned along foot paths (45%). by railway fines (30%) and near hospitals (25%) among other places in Osun State. Adoptors were of the view that their adopted children had made them to be happy (29.5%). and that adoption had made their homes to be stable (73%). Another 60% claimed children adoption was not an additional burden to them. Regarding society respect. 47% agreed that adoption did not erode societal respect.The study concluded that children abandonment was caused mostly by poverty.|Theses Collection|Children/abandonment/adoption/welfare office/unwanted pregnancy/poverty/disability of the child *||||||Faloore, Omiyinka Olutola|M|Urban  poverty and juvenile delinquency in the city of Lagos||||||M.Sc.

(Ikeja High School, llupeju Grammar School, and Victoria Island Secondary School), all in Lagos. All the 49 pupils of the approved schools and 49 randomly selected pupils from the control group were included in the sample survey while 12 others were studied via qualitative methods. The data collected were analysed in two different ways. The qualitative data collected through in-depth interviews were presented using ZY index tables while the quantitative data were processed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Cross tabulation was used to measure independent variables against indices of the dependent variables; while the T-test (two tailed) was used in testing the hypotheses which helped to determine the level of correlation among the variables.The findings showed that there was a significant relationship between urban poverty and juvenile delinquency. Majority (81.6%) of the parents of delinquents as a result of poverty could not adequately take care of their children and this had led to high level of truancy in school. It was also discovered that a large number of delinquents (86%) did not have proper parental upbringing as these parents were leaving home early and coming back very late in order to make ends meet. The study also revealed that some of the delinquents committed anti social behaviours because of the great emphasis that society places on material wealth. This undue emphasis on wealth appeared to be one of the catalysts prompting the children into delinquency, as they wanted to amass wealth at a relatively young age, and was prepared to engage in antisocial behaviours to achieve these objectives.An important conclusion from the study was that many pupils became delinquent in order to acquire wealth, which they knew would give them recognition in the society. This pointed to the negative crucial role that flagrant display of wealth by rich people can cause among poor people. This motivated some of the youngsters to get money through whatever means. However, since crime and delinquency can result from multiple causes, the study pointed out that there will be need for further studies especially those that will investigate the impact of moral and religious teachings on the criminal tendencies of young people in Nigeria.|Theses Collection|*||||||Alao, Oluwagbenga Titus|M|Impact of Oyo - Osogbo catholic diocesan agricultural programme on farmers'production in Osun State, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

Further, the study was designed to determine the farmers' attitude towards the programme, evaluate the extension methods used to teach the farmers and identify problems militating against effective operations of the programme.The study was conducted in the three administrative zones of the programme namely Osogbo, Ijesa and Ila. Thirteen farmers' groups representing 50% of the groups in each zone were purposively selected. Between nine and ten farmers were randomly selected from each group resulting in a total of 120 respondents. Structured interview schedule duly pre-tested and validated was used to collect the data. Frequency count, percentage, mean, ranking and standard deviation were used to describe the data. Correlation analysis, chi-square and contingency coefficient were used to test the stated hypotheses.Results of the study revealed that OODAP had high impact on 41%, while 45% of the respondents derived high level of benefits from the programme. Such benefits included supply of farm inputs at cost, improved farm management, savings habits and enhanced financial status. Sixty-nine percent (69%) had favourable attitude towards participating in the programme, while 88% were at medium level of adoption and shifted from using inorganic fertilizer to organic fertilizer, resulting in an increased yield of 79.5 kg in maize and 59 kg in soybean per hectare. The percentage of arable (maize, soybeans) and tree crop growers (citrus and oil-palm) increased after the inception of the programme. Inadequate credit (96% of the respondents), labour (75.83%), farm tools (61.67%) and poor rural infrastructure (75%) were some of the problems identified as militating against the effective operation of the programme (OODAP). The results also showed that three variables, namely, age (r = 0.181), years of formal education (r = 0.182), and years of farming experience (r = 0.211) correlated positively and significantly (p 0.05) with the impact of OODAP programmes. A significant association was also found between the adoption of soil improvement (x =27.07), improved seeds, and seedlings (x = 16.96) and impact of OODAP. Only five methods of extension used were positively and significantly (p 0.05)) associated with the impact of OODAP namely, general meetings (r = 0.306), agricultural show (r = 0.240), field visit (r = 0.190), demonstration (r = 0.185) and workshops and seminars (r = 0.181). Attitude to OODAP programme (r = 0.197) was also positively and significantly (p . 0.05) correlated with the impact of the programme.In conclusion, the participation of farmers in OODAP programmes had appreciable impact on agricultural production and the socio-economic conditions of the farmers in the three administrative zones of the programme.|Theses Collection|*||||||Igbinlade, Adewumi Segun|M|Investigation of instructional resources in schools of Nursing, Osun State, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The influence of the proprietorship of the schools on availability of the resources as well as the academic performance of the schools in Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria (NMCN) final qualifying examination for general nurses were also evaluated.The four principals of the schools constituted the sample of the study. A checklist adapted from the NMCN Standardized Manual of Accreditation Procedures for Schools of Nursing, Midwifery and Psychiatry Nursing and a questionnaire were used to collect data. The instruments were tested for reliability through test retest method at Oyo State School of Nursing, Eleyele, Ibadan and a correlation coefficient of r=0.89 was obtained. The investigator visited each school to personally assess the instructional resources and complete the checklist with the assistance of the principal. The questionnaire was also given to the principal to complete on arrival and retrieved on the same day. Descriptive and inferential statistical methods were used in analysing the data collected.The findings revealed that all the schools did not have the minimum recommended human and material resources by the accreditation body (NMCN). The result also revealed that there was no significant relationship between availability of human and material resources and proprietorship of the schools. Of importance was the  finding that Obafemi Awolowo UniversityTeaching Hospitals Complex (OAUTHC) not only had more qualified (7) tutorial staff compared with Osogbo (6) and SDA (6) schools of nursing but was better equipped. It also showed that the schools recorded some degree of success in the final qualifying examination for general nurses during the three years studied. It further revealed that all the schools studied tell into "medium" category of academic performance.

Primary data were collected through questionnaires administered to 400 staff and 200 students of four Nigerian universities. The universities were; Obafemi Awolowo University Ile-Ife, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Olabisi Onabanjo University Ago lwoye, and University of Ado-Ekiti. The target sample of 100 staff and 50 students from each of the four universities were purposively selected from five faculties in each of the universities. Secondary data were obtained from NUC periodicals, Annual Reports, Research Bulletins and Statistical Digests. Staff and students' responses to various items on the first set of questionnaires were compiled into contingency tables and all six hypotheses formulated for staff and students' respondents were tested at 0.05 level of significance using chi-square statistics and cross tabulation.Rsults analyses showed that the NUC accreditation had made positive impact on academic programmes (Xc2 = 69.027;) (Xt2 = 12.06; df = 6, p>0.05); that there was continued justification for NUC accreditation exercise (X2c = 7.008, X2t = 12.598; df = 6, p>0.05) and that both staff and students were aware of and familiar with the parameters and categories of status used in the accreditation exercise (Xt2 =14.36; df = 6; 0>0.05).The study further revealed that the accreditation exercise had no impact on the quality of laboratories (X2c = 22.11, X2t = 12.59; df = 6; p<0.05), access to modern sources of information, adequacy of physical facilities for the implementation of the prescribed growth rate for the universities (X2c = 200.17; X2t = 5.99, df = 6; p<0.05); on administrative structure (X2c = 70.30, X2t = 12.59, df = 6, p<0.05) and efficiency of university staff (X2c = 35.55; X21 = 24.99; df = 15; p<0.05).

The research was aimed at comparing the extent of interactions, thermodynamics of mixed micelle formation, and the effects of these surfactant mixtures on the aquation of Iron (II) bipyridyl complex.The critical micelle concentration (cmc) of the mixtures and the kinetics of the aquation reaction were determined using ultraviolet/visible (UV) spectroscopic method at 25°C. The interaction parameter, B, micellar composition, and the activity coefficients of surfactants in the mixture were calculated on the basis of the regular solution theory.The study showed that for the SDS/Triton X-100 system, the cmc values were lower than predicted from ideal mixture theory for all mole fractions of SDS (áSDS) considered, while for the CTAB/Triton X-100 system, the cmc values were lower than predicted from ideal mixture theory at 0 < áCTAB <0.50, beyond which the values were greater than predicted. The interaction parameter, f3 of -2.1 was obtained for the SDS/Triton X-100 system. This negative value of B indicates a net attractive interaction (positive synergism) between the SDS and Triton X-100 molecules resulting in co-aggregate formation. The non-ideality of this system could be largely due to the decreased activity of SDS in the mixed micelle. For the CTAB/Triton X-100 mixture, the average value of â over the entire mole fraction of CTAB (áCTAB ) covered is +0.087, which indicates an overall non-interaction between the CTAB and Triton X-100 molecules, with the system approaching ideality at áCTAB approximately equal to 0.5509. The aquation rate constant kø, for each mole fraction showed a dependence on medium composition for SDS/Triton X-100 system with kø increasing with increase in the concentration of Triton X-100 in the mixture .This is probably due to the decrease in the stabilization of the complex ion with respect to dissolution, a consequence of the decrease in electrostatic attraction between the anionic head group of SDS and the complex ion in the presence of Triton X-100. kø, for CTAB/Triton X-100 system were not significantly different from that in bulk aqueous medium. This study concluded that the SDS/Triton X-100 system exhibited a positive synergism over all mole fractions (áSDS) considered. This was in contrast to the CTAB/Triton X-100 system, which showed positive synergistic effect only at very low mole fractions (áCTAB) of CTAB.|Theses Collection|Aquation reactions/aqueous sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS)/Triton X-100/quation of Iron (II) Bipyridyl complex/surfactant synergism/micellization/thermodynamics/cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)/Triton X-100/electrostatic attraction /anion/mole fractions *||||||Asaolu, Taiwo Olufemi|M|Evaluation of performance of cooperative investment and credit societies (CICS) in financing small scale enterprises (SSES) in Osun State, Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Management & Accounting|Olu Omopariola//M.O.

The questionnaires and interview guide were administered on 70 registered cooperative unions randomly selected from the 106 unions registered in Osun State. One hundred and forty (SSEs) that had benefited from the loan schemes of these unions were purposively selected, representing 2 from each of the 70 registered cooperative unions.One hundred and forty non-cooperative financed small-scale enterprises were also purposively selected to serve as control used to elicit information on the role of CICS in financing SSEs in Osun State. A two-pronged approach was adopted focusing on both the supply and demand sides, and for the supply side, activities of the CICS in financing SSEs in Osun State was evaluated. Interviews with the officials of CICS elicited information on issues relating to the availability of funds and terms of financing SSEs through the CICS institution. For the demand side, questionnaires were used to determine the nature of the financial needs of the SSEs, how they wanted the credit delivered and how well the enterprises had performed. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics such as percentages, ratios, trend analysis and correlation analysis. The study revealed that a positive relationship of r = 0.95 and P<0.54 existed between CICS loans and asset level. The study also revealed that there was a positive relationship of r = 0.75 and P<0.47 between profit levels of SSEs and their utilization of CICS loan. The output of the regression model indicated a positive relationship of r = 0.95 and P<0.58 between CICS loan utilization and level of employment. The study concluded that the CICS had performed fairly well over the years covered. Finally, the spirited efforts made by the different levels of government to energize the cooperative societies, is yielding the expected impacts as the CICS financed SSEs were able to generate more employment and the CICS in Osun State were able to attract more SSEs patronage in terms of working capital (46.4%) and additional investment (40.9%) from an initial capital of 12.7% while the non-CICS financed SSE that operated on bank loans were more or less stagnated at 9.3% for working capital and 16.3% for additional capital from in an initial capital of 15.1%.|Theses Collection|Cooperative Investment and Credit Societies/Small-Scale Enterprises/working capital/loan schemes/availability of funds/level of employment/terms of financing  *||||||Olise, Felix Samuel|M|Determination of concentration of toxic metals in the ambient air in Lagos and Ile-Ife, Nigeria using total reflection X-ray fluorescence technique||||||M.Sc.

Ambient air along major traffic related corridors and residential areas was sampled in June 2002 for SPM at locations selected to reflect variations in level of urban activities including traffic volume and corresponding number of those exposed. Sampling was done using a Nigretti 1000 air sampler for total suspended particulate matter (TSPM) and a stacked Gent PM2.5, 10 sampler to determine the inhalable and respirable fractions. The Whatman 41 filters used for the total suspended particulate matter (TSPM) and Nuclepore filters used for the PM2.5, 10 sampler were digested using analytical grade acids and then analysed using total reflection x-ray fluorescence (TXRF) spectrometer. Concentrations of the pollutants were determined using the quantitative x-ray analysis software (QXAS). The results of elemental analysis were subjected to source identification techniques  enrichment factor, inter-elemental correlation, factor and cluster analyses. The chemical mass balance model was used to apportion contributions of identified sources to the particulate emission.The sult showed that the SPM concentration in Lagos varied from 146 µg/m3 (Motorway/Marine) to 238ug/m3 (Residential) for PM2.5, 371 µg/m3 (Motorway/Marine) to 599ug/m3 for PM10 and 903 µg/m3 to 1414 µg/m3 for the total suspended particulate (TSP). The SPM values obtained for Ile-Ife ranged from 11 µg/m3 (for residential-2 site) to 261 µg/m3 (for motorway-2 site) in respect of PM2.5 particles, 18 µg/m3 (for residential-2 site) to 531 µg/m3 (for motorway-2 site) in respect of PM10 particles, and 107 µg/m3 (for residential-2 site) to l 185 µg/m3 (for motorway-1 site) in respect of TSP. The study concluded that six major sources of suspended particulate matter (SPM) were identified in Lagos. The chemical mass balance (CMB) model apportioned the contributions of five of the identified sources as follows: soil (28%), automobile (70%), marine (1%), residual oil combustion (0.5%) and biomass/residential wood combustion (0.3%). These sources, especially automobile, residual oil combustion and waste combustion should receive priority attention in any air quality management  emissions abatement|Theses Collection|Toxic metals/X-ray fluorescence technique/suspended particulate matter/ambient air/ Whatman 41 filters/Nuclepore filters/ x-ray analysis software/inter-elemental correlation/oil combustion/biomass/residential wood combustion*||||||Adejumo, Oladipo Olukunle|M|Standardisation and modelling of a new total reflection X-ray fluorescence system||||||M.Sc.

The program so developed is applied to the new total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) facility just being set up in the Physics Department of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife to determine the optimum conditions for detecting certain elements in given samples. This program aims at making analytical results using TXRF more traceable since every individual factor contributing to the final result can be isolated and studied.The simulation of the different stages involved in X-ray fluorescence emissions was carried out by writing a suite of computer programs in FORTRAN programming language. These computer simulated XRF stages were then integrated together to generate a general robust model. The model was validated by comparison with experimental spectra from this TXRF system in the Physics Department of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. Trial experiments were carried out with this model to determine optimum conditions for detecting certain elements of interest under various analytical conditions in given samples.Results of these trial experiments show that the minimum detection limits (MDL), of elements, as to be expected, changed from 4.4ng/g for low atomic number elements like Vanadium (Z = 23) to 0.61ng/g for Yttrium (Z = 39) at 20kV applied voltage. At 45kV applied voltage, MDL changed from 1.6ng/g for Vanadium to 0.11ng/g for Yttrium. Variation of parameters of detection geometry such as the glancing incidence angle of the excitation, thickness of the micro -aliquot on the sample support and the nature of the support itself were also found to affect the MDL values. Possible interferences from other x-ray lines including Kâ - and L - lines are also itemized and discussed.The ability of this model to predict the minimum detection limit of elements of interest in any given sample at various analytical conditions optimises the analysis of each element at minimal real operational costs. Comparison of actual experimental values obtained from the x-ray fluorescence spectrometer with predicted values obtained from the model (e.g. excitation spectrum, minimum detection limit, etc) will go a long way in evaluating the performance of a given spectrometer relative to expected theoretical performance. This could help alert to possible malfunctioning.|Theses Collection|Simulation/X-ray fluorescence (XRF) system/total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) facility/programming language/Fortran/minimum detection limits (MDL)/spectrometer *||||||Morakinyo, Moshood Kayode|M|A kinetic study of the leaching iron and management from a Nigerian tantalite ore||||||M.Sc.

The aims of the study were to explore a practicable hydrometallurgical process, establish the optimum conditions and determine the activation energies for the leaching of iron and manganese from Awo tantalite ore, with HCl HNO3 and H2SO4 solutions as leachants.The total elemental composition of the tantalite ore was determined using Total Reflection X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometry (TXRF) and the amount of iron and manganese leached were determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS). Analysis of the experimental data for the leaching rates of iron and manganese from the ore was based on the shrinking core model (SCM) for chemical and diffusion controlled reactions. The apparent activation energies for the leaching of iron and manganese were obtained using the Arrhenius expression: k = Ae-Ea/RTThe study showed that the leaching rates were significantly dependent on the particle size of the ore, stirring speed, temperature, concentration and the nature of the acid solutions. Within the first 120 minutes of leaching, iron and manganese were largely leached by HCl solution. After 120 minutes more iron was leached by H2SO4 solution. The observed effects of the relevant operating variables on the leaching rates were consistent with the ash/product layer diffusion-controlled kinetic model: l+ 2(1 - a) - 3(1  a)2/3= k2t. However, the chemical controlled kinetics model: 1  (1-a)1/3 = kit was applicable in some cases such as the leaching of iron by the use of HCl solution at all temperatures (30 -90 °C) with a slight deviation at 30 °C, HNO3 solution at the lowest temperature of 30 °C and the leaching of manganese by the use of HCI solution at 30  50 °C. The activation energies for the leaching of iron by the use of HCl, H2SO4 and HNO3 solutions were 14.50. 34.99 and 35.00 KJ/mol respectively while the corresponding values for the leaching of manganese by the use of HCI and H2SO4 solutions were 19.91 and 60.78 KJ/mol respectively for the diffusion controlled reaction. For the chemical controlled reaction, activation energy values of 16.52 and 37.28 KJ/mol were obtained for the leaching of iron by the use of HCl and H2SO4 solutions respectively while activation energy values of 12.63 and 29.56 KJ/mol were obtained for the leaching of manganese by the use of HCI and H2SO4 solutions respectively. In conclusion, it was observed that HCI solution was the best leachant of iron and manganese from the tantalite ore when compared with H2SO4 and HNO3 solutions and the shrinking core model for diffusion controlled reaction was applicable to the leaching process.|Theses Collection|Leaching iron/manganese/tantalite ore/hydrochloric acid(HCl)/trioxonitrate (V) acid(HNO3)/tetraoxosulphate(Vl) acid (H2SO4)/hydrometallurgical process/Total Reflection X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometry (TXRF)/Absorption Spectrometry (AAS)/shrinking core model (SCM)/diffusion/Arrhenius expression/leachants*||||||Erhabor,  Folakemi Ayodele|F|Pentecostal movement and adolescent sexuality in Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The main objectives of the study were to investigate adolescents' sexual behaviour within the Pentecostal Movement; investigate the influence of  Pentecostal ideology on adolescent reproductive health issues such as, premarital sex, adolescent pregnancy, abortion etc; examine the adolescents' perception of the Pentecostal Movements' doctrine as regards their own health needs and sexual behaviour; and assess the adequacy of the facilities within the Pentecostal Churches, vis-a-vis the needs of the adolescents.Five Pentecostal and Orthodox Churches were purposively selected for the study to enable some comparison to be made in the behaviour of the adolescents in these Churches. Selection was based on the age of the church (10 years and above); number of branches in Ile Ife town; and adolescents population of 10 and above. Systematic random sampling was used to select two hundred (200) respondents from each of the Orthodox and Pentecostal group of churches. The research instruments used were structured questionnaires for the adolescents and in-depth interview schedules for ten (10) leaders of the selected churches. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as frequency tables, cross tabulation, percentages and graphs. Content analysis including the use of Z-Y index tables was adopted for the analysis of the qualitative data.The results of this study indicated that rapid growth, emotional tension and sexual temptations were the most frequently mentioned characteristics of adolescents. Despite the fact that this stage of development was perceived as problematic by some (50.0%  Orthodox and 50.0% Pentecostal) of the respondents, majority (65.5% Orthodox and 50% Pentecostal) were still excited about the changes in their bodies, however, they believed in counselling on how to cope emotionally. The age of sexual experience by the adolescents who had sexual intercourse was early (10-15 years) within the two groups of churches and most of the respondents had knowledge of contraceptives, but usage was low. It was also shown that majority (65% in Orthodox and 86.5% in Pentecostal Churches) of  them abstained from sexual intercourse. While 53.8% in Orthodox and 76.0% in Pentecostal Churches attributed their sexual behaviour to Church doctrine/teaching, only a few mentioned parental admonition despite good interpersonal relationship with their parents and peers. It was further discovered that church doctrine/teaching and counselling were major factors influencing the adolescents' sexuality/moral life.The study concluded that the Pentecostal Movement positively influenced adolescent's sexual behaviour and prevention of reproductive health hazards and that early introduction of sex education would be beneficial to the adolescents. Finally, Pentecostal Movement as against Orthodox Churches appeared to prepare the adolescents better in grappling with the problems of adolescence and had better influence on their sexuality/morals.|Theses Collection|Religion/sexuality/Pentecostal movement/reproductive health issues/adolescent/rapid growth/emotional tension/sexual temptations/sexual intercourse/contraceptives/Church doctrine/teaching/sex education *||||||Tobih, Deborah Oluwafunmilola|F|Evaluation of the development and administration of undergraduate degree examinations in Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife||||||Ph.D. Tests & Measurement|E.R.I Afolabi||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Educational Foundations & Counselling|2004|||OAU|||||ix,179p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

In this respect, the study examined the perceptions of the various stakeholders on the conduct and administration of University examinations.A descriptive research design was used for the study. The population for the study comprised of the students, lecturers, heads of departments, examination committee members, and examination invigilators in Obafemi Awolowo University. The samples, which were selected using, stratified random procedure, consisted of 778 students, 100 lecturers, 33 heads of departments, four examination committee members, 200 examination invigilators and the Senior Assistant Registrar (Examinations).Data for the study were collected using six research instruments namely; Students' Opinionnaire on University Examinations (SOUE), Lecturers, Opinionnaire on University Examinations (LOUE), Heads of Departments Opinionnaire on University Examinations (HODOUE), Examination Committee Members Opinionnaire on University Examinations (ECOUE), Examination Observation Schedule (EOS) and Interview Schedule for Examination Officer (ISUEO). The instruments were developed and validated by the researcher. The data were analyzed using percentages, analysis of variance and multiple regressions.The major findings showed that 58% of the lecturers preferred essay type questions to objective items for semester examinations. Also, 50% of the lecturers utilized question banks, 20% utilized textbooks, and 30% of the lecturers utilized field experiences and periodical publications in the generation of examination items. In the preparation of the examination questions only 64% of lecturers endeavoured to generate item that covered the content domain of courses taught. Also, results showed that 24% of the heads of departments validated the examination items through moderation by most senior lecturers in the department and by external examiner for the final year examination questions. The study also confirmed that the arrangement of examination timetable and condition of the examination hall had significant influence on students' perception of their performance in university examinations. (F = 37.306, P < 0.05). The parameter estimate indicate that partial correlation coefficients of all independent variables had positive relationship with students' perception of their performance in university examinations and the regression equation revealed that for any extra unit of effort or improvement in the arrangement of examination time-table and in the condition of examination hall, there was a corresponding positive increase in students perception of their performance in university examinations.In conclusion, the process of validation of examination questions in the university did not follow any uniform or standard procedure, and continous assessment scores appeared to be sometimes misused.

If the algebra has a minimal approximate identity, the induced map Tm of a multiplier algebra onto another is a norm-decreasing extension of T. Building on this and other results, we first generalized the triangular matrix Banach algebra and then considered the n-dimensional case. This condition was then tested for the existence of minimal norm. We further determined the nature of hermitian elements of the upper- triangular matrix algebra using the proposition that any hermitian element of a complex unital Banach algebra satisfies:lim {¦1+iáh¦-1}=0á?0It was discovered that satisfying the conditions for which norm-decreasing isomorphisms are isometric eventually leads to the existence of minimal norms in the algebras considered. It was also revealed that hermitian elements of our matrix algebra are diagonal matrices with real entries. Furthermore, any norm-decreasing isomorphism on a unital Banach algebra preserves the hermitian property. Finally it was established that the minimal norm on the upper triangular matrix Banach algebra is the absolute value of the first entry a11. With this norm, isometry automatically holds provided the sum of all other nonzero entries converges.In conclusion, whenever a transformation between two Banach algebras is norm decreasing, and the norm involved is minimal, the transformation is always norm-preserving.|Theses Collection|Isomorphism/Banach algebras/isometry/ hermitian elements/*||||||Ibraheem, Omodele|M|Catalytic properties of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from the fungus aspergillus||||||M.Sc.

The subunit molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 52,800 + 1,100 daltons, which implied that the enzyme was a dimer. The enzyme exhibited strict specificity towards both substrates, NADP+ and G6P, with Km values of 5.62 + 0.94 µM and 73.48 + 3.79µM respectively, at pH 7.5. NADPH was found to be a competitive inhibitor with the two substrates of the enzyme, NADP+ and G6P. Zn2+ and Co2- ions inhibited the enzyme; the inhibition in each case was competitive with G6P and the K, values were 6.6µM and 4.6µM respectively. Other divalent metal ions namely nickel, cadmium and manganese were also found to be inhibitors of the enzyme. The enzyme had a broad pH optimum, which ranged from 8.3-9.5, while the optimum temperature for the enzyme was found to be 37°C. The pKa of the ionizing group in the enzyme-substrate (ES Complex was about 8.0, suggesting, possibly, the presence of an -SH group of cysteine at the enzyme active site that may be involved in catalysis. The pKa of the ionizing group in the free enzyme (E) was about 7.3, suggesting an imidazole of histidine in the enzyme active site that participated in the binding of G6P and NADP+.

The objectives of the study were to assess the floristic biodiversity and structural properties of the forest reserve, to determine the status of soil properties in the forest reserve and to assess the impact of illegal logging on the economy of Osun State.Three sites were chosen from the study area: Onida area as site A (a poorly managed area where illegal felling activities occurred), site B is the Idiahun area (a managed area where heavy illegal felling activities occurred) and site C, the Apoje area (a relatively undisturbed site of a managed area of the forest). Five grids of 20m X 20m were demarcated from an area of 200m X 200m and marked in each of the study sites. Tree height, girth, volume of wood, basal area values, above ground biomass and indices of species diversity were determined on each site. Soil samples were collected from the sample plots at depths of 0  15 cm (topsoil) and 15 - 30 cm (subsoil) to determine the organic matter content, (O.M.) available phosphorus, total nitrogen, and water holding capacity. Questionnaires were administered to the registered timber contractors and the forest officials to elicit information on the extent of the activities of the illegal loggers.The results of the study revealed that all the vegetation parameters in the relatively undisturbed site of the forest reserve were significantly higher than those of the two sites where illegal felling activities occurred. The index of species diversity was significantly higher in the relatively undisturbed site compared with the two sites where illegal logging activities occurred. This variation did not reflect in indices of species richness in the three sites. The family Sterculiaceae dominated the three sites in order of 22.2%, 17.5% and 16.8% for sites C, B and A respectively. The organic matter contents of the site were not affected by the management practices. However, the total N and available P were significantly reduced by 10  14% in site A and 14  16% in site B as compared with the control site. High poverty level, obsolete existing forestry laws, poor funding of the Forestry Department by the government, and collusion of the forestry officials with the illegal loggers were identified to be responsible for the high incidence of indiscriminate exploitation of timber trees in the forest reserve.The study concluded that illegal exploitation of timber trees and poor management practices in the forest reserve have negative impact on the vegetation parameters and the soil properties measured with significant influence on the diversity of species in the forest.|Theses Collection|Forest management/timber tree/logging/floristic biodiversity/forest reserve/felling/Sterculiaceae/poor funding/poverty level/corruption/exploitation of timber trees*||||||Daramola, Michael Olawale|M|Mathematical modelling of liquid -liquid extraction process||||||M.Sc.

The aim was to achieve a design procedure that is superior to existing algorithms and to study the effect of perturbation on the system.The sum rates algorithm was implemented in this work as a performance evaluation for staged liquid-liquid extraction. Also, existing short-cut design methods were made use of in developing the proposed rigorous algorithms. A comparative study involving the proposed rigorous design algorithm and the existing one was also undertaken with a view to recommending the best algorithms for future use in the determination of the theoretical extraction stages required to achieve a specified degree of separation in a multi-component system.

Also the computational and storage demand is high for the rigorous method.In conclusion, the result showed that the proposed design algorithm yielded results of a much higher accuracy than the shortcut methods. Also, small perturbations (K-values and flow rates) did not affect the performance of the system.|Theses Collection|Computer algorithms/mathematical modelling/multistage liquid-liquid extraction processes/perturbation  *||||||Udo, Rhoda Okon|F|Development of a security model for mobile agent software||||||M.Sc.

The conceptual design was based on the hybridization of two security schemes, which are the Rivest Shamir Aldeman (RSA) scheme and the Digital Signature Algorith (DSA). The scheme developed was modeled, and java programming language was employed to simulate and test the applicability of the system. The applicability of the model was demonstrated using a prototype local area network comprising of three work stations.The result of the system simulation obtained was used to encrypt a selected Java code to prevent alteration to the code and message. The encrypted code and message was digitally signed to safeguard the host resources from being attacked by malicious agent. A malicious code was introduced to attack the system and a message of a malicious attempt was returned. The recipient was not prone to danger when signature was verified as authentic. The encrypted and signed code obtained, displayed a high level of authentication, confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation. The developed model showed improved performance degradation over the existing scheme.In conclusion, the study established the framework, which resolved the security threats that mobile agent system faced on its itinerary.|Theses Collection|Mobile agent software/security model/hybridization/Rivest Shamir Aldeman (RSA) scheme/Digital Signature Algorith (DSA)/java/programming language/local area network/simulation/encrupt   *||||||Olusunle, Samuel Olugbenga|M|Modelling of solidification kinetics of some aluminium alloys||||||M.Sc.

The computation of the heat transfer equation using the finite element method was carried out using the MATLAB software. Boundary conditions were imposed at the desired locations, after which meshes for the transient heat conduction equation were obtained. The study was carried out for simple and complex shaped objects. The model was also used to simulate ingot covered with insulating material and also with exothermic mixture.The results obtained showed that the temperature profiles from the model agreed with those observed for the castings, both for the simple and complex shapes. The model revealed the pattern of the temperature distribution and the highest temperature points (804.5-940 °C  heat centers) were found to coincide with defect areas in the castings. However, when the ingot was covered with the insulating materials and exothermic mixture, castings with fewer defects were obtained. This was found to be in agreement with the findings reported in literature.The study concluded that the model can be used to predict defects and the fraction of solid transformed as a function of time and temperature in the castings.|Theses Collection|Solidification kinetics/heat transfer equation/temperature/aluminium alloys/MATLAB software/transient heat conduction equation/exothermic mixture/ingot/insulation*||||||Akinbola, Bolaji Mustapha|M|The effects of  fiscal policy on macroeconomic variables in Nigeria (1970 -2000)||||||M.Sc.

Specifically, it examined the nature and causes of fiscal imbalances in Nigeria from 1970-2000 and assessed the empirical relationship between macroeconomic variables and fiscal policy instruments.The study utilized secondary data obtained from publications of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) notably International Financial Yearbook and Statistical Bulletin of various editions. The method of analysis was basically econometric technique. The use of augmented Dickey  Fuller (ADF) test was first used to examine the time series properties of the variables. Then the Ordinary Least Square method of estimation was used to examine the effects of fiscal policy variables on macroeconomic performance. A modified St. Louis equation was employed. it expressed sets of macro variables as functions of fiscal and monetary policies variables. The macro variables considered for this work were Economic Growth, Inflationary Rate, Unemployment and External Balances while fiscal policy variables considered were Government Expenditure, Deficit Finance and Tax Revenue.The main findings showed that all targeted variables were statistically significant at 5% level. Precisely, 50% increase in Government Expenditure, 74% increase in Tax Revenue and 53% increase in Fiscal Deficit respectively led to 100% change in economic growth. Also 6% increase of Government Expenditure, 14% increase in Tax Revenue and 10% increase in Fiscal Deficit respectively led to 100% level increase in the general price level of goods and services. Furthermore, in the case of External Balance, 126% increase in Government Expenditure, 53% increase in Deficit Finance and 151% increase in Tax Revenue respectively led to 100% increase in External Balance. Finally it was observed that 100% increase in unemployment came up as a result of decrease in Tax Revenue by 14%, Fiscal Deficit by 10% and Government Expenditure by 6%.The study concluded that the Fiscal Policy was a better policy option to correct macroeconomic imbalances in Nigeria and by extension in any other developing economy. Hence, Government should correct macroeconomic disequilibrium herself, rather than leave such a great task in the hand of Monetary Authorities that were no capable of resolving the imbalances.|Theses Collection|Fiscal policy/macroeconomic variables/fiscal imbalances/fiscal policy instruments/ Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)/International Financial Yearbook/Statistical Bulletin/econometric technique/augmented Dickey  Fuller (ADF) test/Economic Growth/Inflationary Rate/Unemployment/External Balances/Government Expenditure/Deficit Finance/Tax Revenue*||||||Usman, Bassi Peter|M|Effects of tetracycline on halofantrine pharmacokinetics in healthy human||||||M.Sc.

To prolong the therapeutic useful life of the drug and also enhance its efficacy, it would seem appropriate to recommend a co-administration of the drug with other antimalarial drug(s). The combination of halofantrine (HF) with tetracycline (TCN) is a viable option since the antibiotic has antimalarial action and is co-administered with other antimalarials such as quinine. This study reports on the influence of tetracycline on the pharmacokinetic profiles of halofantrine.Ten healthy male volunteers were each given 500mg single oral doses of HF alone or with TCN (500mg 12 hourly for 7 days) in a crossover fashion. Blood samples collected at predetermined intervals were analysed for HF and its major metabolite, desbutyhalofantrine (HFM), using a validated HPLC method. The data were subjected to pharmacokinetic analysis. In Electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at each blood sampling time. Side effects (e.g. nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain) were also noted.Co-administration of tetracycline resulted in an increase in HFCmax (0.58±0.48 vs. 0.84 ± 0.31 µg/ml) AUCT (36.47 ± 21.67 vs. 53.39 ± 25.53 ug.hr/ml) terminal eliminationhalf-life (104 ± 34 vs. 145±71 hr), mean residence time (MRT) (154 ± 47 vs. 194 ± 100hr), as well as a decrease in volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) (42 ± 23 vs. 31±11 L/kg) and oral clearance (CL/F) (18.27 ± 9.0 vs. 11.5 ± 9.1L/hr). However, these differences were not statistically significant (I' > 0.05). Similarly, a non-significant increase was observed in the AUC, Cmax and MRT or HFM (p > 0.05) follow in HF and tetracycline co-administration.The side effects and ECG recordings were comparable after administration of HF with or without tetracycline. The tetracycline-induced changes in III disposition, though not significant, are probably due to a reduction in enterohepatic recycling of halofantrine.The results showed that the combination of HF plus tetracycline had no significant adverse pharmacokinetic interaction in humans and might be useful in the treatment of drug resistant falciparum malaria.|Theses Collection|Halofantrine/antimalarial agent/a phenanthrene methanol/tetracycline/antibiotic/pharmacokinetic/desbutyhalofantrine/Electrocardiogram/falciparum malaria*||||||Eretan, Oladiran Babalola|M|Purification and partial characterisation of the haemagglutinating protein from the fresh leaves of dog's liver kalanchoe crenata ( Andr.) haw.||||||M.Sc.

Haw, a member of the Saxifragaceae family; with a view to serve as a chemotaxonomic marker for other plants of the family.The haemagglutination assay and hapten inhibition test were carried out with the crude leaves extract. The purification of the haemagglutinating protein was by ion-exchange chromatography on a DEAFcellulose column followed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-100 column. The molecular size was determined by gel filtration and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis respectively. Covalently bound carbohydrate was detected by staining the gels after electrophoresis with periodic acid Schiffs reagent. The sugar was estimated using the modified anthrone reaction. The effects of temperature and pH on the heamagglutinating activity were determined by incubating aliquots of the protein at different temperature and pH values respectively, while the effect of ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) and divalent cations such as Mg2+ , Mn2+ and Ba2+ were investigated on serial two-fold dilutions of lectin preparation in phosphate saline buffer.Haemagglutinating protein from extracts of the leaves of Kalanchoe crenata agglutinated human red blood cells non-specifically. The haemagglutinating activity was inhibited by melibiose and enhanced by arabinose and cellobiose. The purified haemagglutinating protein showed a band both in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The relative molecular weight (Mr) determined by SDS-PAGE was about 44,000 daltons and thatestimated from gel filtration was 47,000 daltons. Treatment of the haemagglutinating protein with the chelating agent, EDTA reduced the haemagglutinating activity to 50% of the original level while divalent cations Mg2+, Mg2+ and Ba2+ were effective activators. It showed maximum activity over pH range 3 - 7.5 and it was relatively heat stable up to 90°C. It had 3 molecules of sugar covalently attached to a single strand polypeptide.The study showed that Kalanchoe crenata contained a lectin that is non-specific in its haemagglutinating property (panalectin). Such lectins have been shown to mediate anti-inflammatory responses in animal and as such its presence may justify the ethnomedical use of the plant in the treatment of aches and pains.|Theses Collection|Haemagglutinating protein/Kalanchoe crenata/chemotaxonomy/chromatography/gel filtration/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/modified anthrone reaction/ethylenediaminetetracetic acid/Saxifragaceae family*||||||Alamu, Salawu Abideen|M|Evaluation of pest management strategies in the production of exotic vegetables in Oyo State, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

Data were collected on pest management system of these crops from 47 exotic vegetable farmers in Akinleye, Oluyole, Ogbomosho South and Ogbomosho North local government areas of Oyo State. Questionnaires and oral interviews were used for primary data collection. Data collected were analyzed using engineering economic and statistical techniques.The result showed that cultural, biological, mechanical and chemical control measures were the major pest control strategies identified by the study. Chemical control emerged as the principal pest management strategy undertaken by the exotic vegetables growers. This was reflected in their choice of pesticides as the only viable technology of pest management especially in insects, mites and diseases control. All the farmers interviewed used insecticides to control insects while 83 percent of the respondents used herbicides to control weeds. Also, 80 and 17 percent of the farmers controlled rodents and weeds, respectively, by mechanical method. The return on investment of the enterprise ranged from 1.18 to 1.29, indicating that the farmers were making profit and ensured their continuity in the business. It was further shown that profit dependent on farm size and amount of money invested on the farm.In conclusion, there was a high, positive and significant correlation (r=0.79, p<0.01) between the level of financial investment and farm size.

The aim was to identify the vegetation types and determine the factors responsible for vegetational variation on the inselberg.Seven  sample plots. 0.06ha, whose altitudes ranged from 286m at the base (latitude 7°31.361'N, longitude 4031.48E) to 461m at the peak (latitude 7°31.63'N. longitude 4°31.481E) were established at 100m interval along a line transect running from the base to the peak of the inselberg. In each plot, soil samples were randomly collected at two depths; 0-15 cm and 15-30cm and analysed for physical and chemical properties (pH, particle size distribution. organic matter content, exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na), total nitrogen, exchangeable acidity, cation exchangeable capacity and base saturation). Altitude, soil depth and soil moisture of the plots were also determined. All woody stems were identified. Girth sizes of the woody plant species were measured at breast height, climber and herbaceous species were identified in each plot. The type of vegetation of each plot was identified and described. Species richness, number of genera and families were established for the plots. Stem density, basal area and species  diversity index were calculated for each plot. The data were subjected to analyses using analysis of variance,correlation analysis, cluster analysis and principal component analysis (ordination). The study showed that there was a significant difference among the plots in soil depth, pH, sand, soil moisture, clay and organic matter. Plant species, plant genera, plant families,density, bas al area and species diversity varied remarkably along the altitudinal gradient. Three vegetation types were identified on the inselberg;forest (at the base and lower slopes), grass savanna ( at the steep under slopes) and woodland savanna (at the peak). Plant species richness was highest in the forest vegetation and lowest in the grass savanna vegetation. A total of 126 plant species (86 tree and shrub species, 16 herbs species, 24 climber species) were encountered belong to 117 genera and 49 families. Stem density ha-1, basal area and species diversity decreased significantly along the attitudinal gradient. Apocynaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Mimosoideae, Moraceae, Rubiaceae and Sapindaceae were most common families in the forest vegetation while Papilionoideae and Poaceae were common in the grass and woodland savanna. There was a significant correlation (p < 0.01) between soil depth, soil moisture, silt, altitude, slope and organic matter and the vegetation parameters. Soil depth, soil moisture, silt and sand were shown by the ordination analysis as the factors determining the vegetation variation on the inselberg.The study concluded that the variation in vegetation on the inselberg was due in part to the remarkable reduction in soil depth and soil moisture with altitude. The other soil factors; sand and silt, shown as affecting vegetation variation along attitudinal gradient probably did so through their effects on soil moisture, especially soil sand content.|Theses Collection|Vegetation type/altitudinal gradient/inselberg/vegetational variation/exchangeable acidity/cation exchangeable capacitysaturation/girth sizes/basal area/ stem density/soil moisture/woodland savanna*||||||Famurewa, Olubunmi Rachael|F|Effects of coloured illustrations on the acquisition of poster making skills among junior secondary school students of Ife Central Local Government||||||M.A. Educational Technology|Adeyanju 'lade Joel//D.K.

The study also found out if teaching with coloured illustrated drawing will lead to higher performance on poster making among secondary school Fine Art students than when illustrated posters are not used.A pre-test, post-test-control group quasi-experimental design was used for the study. Two hundred and forty Junior Secondary School class three (J.S.S. III) students who were randomly selected from two schools (public and private) served as sample for the study. The students were further randomly assigned into three separate groups: A, B and C. Subjects in group A were exposed to multi-colour illustration; those in group B were exposed to monochromic illustration while subjects in group C were not exposed to any illustration, but exposed to unrelated pictures which constituted the control group. The treatment extended over three weeks of five lessons. Poster Design Achievement Test (PDAT) and Poster Drawing Test (PDT) were administered as pre-test and post-test. The scores in the pre-test and post-test were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.ANOVA showed that a significant difference exists among the three groups F = 791.34 (df 2, 237, P > 0.05).

Two oil communities each were selected from three of the nine oil--producing States in Nigeria: Ibeno and Eket (Akwa lbom State), Obunagha and Elebele (Bayelsa State), and Ughelli and Uzere (Delta State) using multi-staged sampling technique. A total of 284 respondents completed the interview survey, while 30 participated in the in-depth interviews. The respondents were selected from a cross-section of the stakeholders in the Niger Delta: government officials, stall of multinational oil companies and representative groups within the host communities-traditional rulers, opinion leaders, officials of town unions, youth groups, farmers and fishermen, artisans, and so on. A total of 36 focus group discussions were conducted separately with male and female community leaders, adults and youths in each of the six study communities. Secondary data were drawn mainly from existing literature, newspapers, newsmagazines, and institutional publications by relevant governmental and non-governmental agencies, oil companies, as well as archival materials at the Public Record Office in London.The study showed that multinational oil companies and the Nigerian State played pivotal roles in the exacerbation of violent conflicts in the Niger Delta. The study found that the historical raison d'etre and mandate of the post-colonial Nigerian State as a subservient agent for international capital foreclosed genuine efforts to tackle oil-induced crises in the Niger Delta. It also revealed that the complexities of formal and informal networks between the Nigerian State and multinational oil companies continued to facilitate the acquisition, monopolization and dispensation of violence by the State as demonstrated by the large-scale militarization of the Niger Delta. The work found that relying solely on contemporary factors and events to account for the collapse of public order in the oil region is theoretically and methodologically limited, hence the need to also investigate the complementary role(s) played by history. The study established that each historical phase in the incorporation of the Niger Delta into the global political economy was marked by chaos and instabilities- a trend that intensified in contemporary times. The eventual exclusion of the non-elite segments of the Niger Delta society from the material benefits accruing from increased crude oil earnings, at the same time that oil communities were left to bear the adverse externalities of crude oil-induced economic marginalization, political domination and environmental degradation, was a central factor fuelling violent conflicts. This situation also continued to push and pitch different ethnic groups in the region against one another in intense violent conflicts. Finally, the study found that the narrow notions of security in government circles, as demonstrated by the preference for military rather than political solutions to the crises in the oil region, have continued to make the search for durable peace and meaningful development elusive. The study concluded that the conditions and circumstances precipitating conflicts in Nigeria's Delta region might not change significantly to pave the way for dialogue, reconciliation and partnership among the stakeholders; and that current initiatives to address the plight of oil communities would be a catalyst for development only if government and multinational oil companies allowed oil communities to have effective representation on matters affecting them.|Theses Collection|*||||||Shobola, Adeola Ayodeji|F|The study of the effects of covert positive reinforcement and cognitive restructuring therapies on cigarette smoking behaviour of undergraduate students||||||P.h.D.

It also examined the influence of smoker socio-demographic variables such as age, gender, academic level, religious affiliation, parents' smoking behaviour, siblings' smoking behaviour and age of commencement of cigarette smoking on the efficacy of the therapies in reducing cigarette smoking behaviour.The research followed a pre-test control group design. The subjects used for the study consisted of 90 volunteer undergraduate students (female = 19, male = 71) of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. The selection was done by inviting cigarette smokers that were willing to quit smoking to come for treatment. These volunteer subjects were divided into three groups of 30 each. Members of the two experimental groups were 60 students that had the highest severity and regularity of smoking and they were randomly assigned to each group. The remaining 30 were assigned to the control group.The two research instruments used for this study were Sources of Satisfaction of Cigarette Smoking Inventory (SSCSI) and Attitude towards Cigarette Smoking Inventory (ATCSI). The SSCI was an adapted version of Donald and Judith and Akinyele, this instrument was used in determining the cigarette smoking behaviour score of subjects. The ATCSI was given to the subjects before the treatment to measure their attitude towards cigarette smoking. The treatment entailed the application of CPR and CR therapies on the experimental groups while the control group was not exposed to any therapy. The treatment lasted four weeks of eight group sessions of 45 minutes each. The ATCSI was re-administered to the subjects to also measure their attitude towards cigarette smoking after the treatment. The data collected were analysed using t-test and multiple regression analyses. Research hypotheses were tested at 0.05 level of significance.The results indicated that subjects exposed to CPR therapy reduced the frequency of cigarette smoking (pre-test X = 8.73, SD = 2.27, df = 58; post-test X = 0.43, SD = 0.94, df =58), and the difference between the mean values was significant (t=18.5, df = 58, P<0.05). Likewise the subjects exposed to CR therapy were able to reduce the frequency of cigarette smoking (pre-test X = 9.27, SD = 2.01, df = 58; post-test X = 0.167, SD = 0.379, df = 58), and the difference between the mean values was significant (t=24.5, df = 58, P<0.05).The result further indicated that CR was more effective in changing the attitude of smokers toward cigarette smoking than CPR, (t = 4.37; df = 58, P<0.05). In addition, there was attitudinal change in the subjects exposed to CPR from favourable to less favourable when the pre-test and post-test scores were compared and this was significant (t =15.9, df = 58, P<0.05).The results of the multiple regression analyses revealed that the two therapies (CPR and CR) when combined with the socio-demographic variables were not significant at 0.05 level of significant, r=0.518, r =0.499 for CPR and CR respectively. Siblings smoking behaviour had a significant influence on CPR (t = 2.479, P<0.05). While the age of commencement of cigarette smoking had a significant influence on CR (t =-2.645, P<0.05). Likewise gender, t = - 2.168, (P<0.05) and religion, t = -2.329, (P<0.05) had significant influence on CR. The study concluded that both covert positive reinforcement and cognitive restructuring were effective in reducing cigarette smoking of university undergraduates. Cognitive restructuring (CR) however, was more effective than the Covert positive reinforcement (CPR).|Theses Collection|*||||||Ogunleye, Simeon Olukayode|M|Contrasts between logistic regression and discriminant analysis for data on tuberculosis patients||||||M.Sc.

Other statistical tools used were chi-square probability distribution for determining whether variables are related or not and correlation coefficient to determine the extent to which the two variables are related. The computer program (SPSS 10.0) from Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used for all of the analyses.The result obtained showed that variables Age (X1) and Housing condition of the patients (X7) had no correlation with the outcome variable and were therefore extracted from the analysis. The result of test of significance of individual estimators also revealed that only length of time of reporting to the appropriate hospital (X8), social history of the patients (X4) and previous exposure to diseases (X5) had significant effects on the complication of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Y). It was also revealed that logistic regression did better than discriminant analysis in terms of the proportion of correct classifications.The study concluded that logistic regression analysis is more effective in related health problems of Tuberculosis patients in which a discrete and dichotomous data are available.|Theses Collection|*||||||Koya, Olufemi Adebola|M|Studies of the mechanics of nut cracking and centrifugal separation of palm kernel -shell mixture||||||Ph.D. Agricultural Engineering |M.O.

The physical characteristics were correlated to provide base-line data required for optimal design of nutcrackers and palm kernel-shell mixture separators. The effect of cracking techniques on the quality of the product was determined by sorting out whole kernels from damaged ones. Theoretical and experimental analyses of palm kernel and shell motion on spinning discs were also determined as means of separating the mixture. A feasible scheme for an integral nut cracking and product separation system was then proposed.The results showed that the geometric means of the nuts were 17.1 to 27.7 mm, 22.3 to 26.5 mm and 17.4 to 23.8 mm for Dura, Tenera and Pisifera varieties respectively, and the corresponding geometric means of embedded kernels were 10.8 to 13.3 mm, 11.1 to 14.5 mm and 11.3 to 13.1 mm. The relative densities of kernel and shell were 1.12 and 1.27 for Dura, 1.11 and 1.25 for Tenera and 1.10 and 1.11 for Pisifera varieties respectively. The result also showed that sieving could serve only as a precleaner. The findings further revealed that the minimum force for cracking the smallest size nuts were 918 N, 1794 N and 534 N for Dura, Tenera and Pisifera varieties respectively. A regression model relating force (F) to deformation (D) was obtained in the form F = kDn with coefficients of determination of 0.95 and 0.88 for Dura and Tenera varieties respectively. The equation enabled a direct computation of material modulus of toughness and material stiffness. Experimental verification showed that a derived expression based on a modified Hertz Law is sufficiently adequate in predicting the force required for cracking palm nuts. The interactive effect of reducing speed below the normal operating speed, grading the nuts for differential cracking speed, and recycling unbroken nuts in the machine, gave better cracking efficiency and reduced kernel breakage considerably. However, machine cracked nuts were more laden with smaller shell fractions than manual cracking. The new concept of separation based on differential motion of kernel and shell on spinning disc, without re-wetting the product, was feasible, with separation on a single disc overlaid with nail-perforated plate being the most promising (roughness ratio = 0.17), when the disc was flat and rotating at 250 rpm.In conclusion, the study provided material-related inputs necessary for design improvement of existing nutcrackers and development of a new kernel-shell separator.|Theses Collection|Nut cracking/palm kernel-shell mixture/centrifugal force/palm-nut/spinning disc/kernel-shell separator/Hertz Law*||||||Olagunju, Michael Adesegun|M|Exchange rate depreciation and Nigeria's external sector performance 1986 - 2002||||||M.Sc.

In specific terms the study examined the magnitude of the depreciation of the Naira exchange rate since 1986 and the impact of this depreciation on the country's balance of trade and foreign reserves. This is against the background of the postulate in international finance theory that depreciation will lead to an improvement in a country's balance of payments and some empirical studies, which found otherwise.The study made use of secondary data sourced from the International Financial Statistics of the IMF and the Statistical Bulletin of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). To enhance the validity of the conclusions drawn from the results, quarterly data were used. The growth rate of the nominal exchange rate was generated to determine the magnitude of the depreciation of the nominal exchange rate between 1986 and 2002. The study then employed the use of the more robust Vector Autoregressive (VAR) modelling to examine the impact of exchange rate depreciation on the balance of trade and foreign reserves. The impulse response (I-R) functions of the variables using a ten-quarter horizon and the variance decomposition of the balance of trade and foreign reserves models were then generated and analysed.The results showed that there was a period of exchange rate stability, which was sandwiched between two periods of exchange rate depreciation. Furthermore, most of the coefficients under the real exchange rate in the I-R functions of the balance of trade assumed the expected negative signs. For the fifth, seventh, ninth and tenth quarters, the coefficients were -0.035, -0.108, -0.124 and -0.099 respectively. This was corroborated by the variance decomposition where, after own shock, real exchange rate ranked next beyond lag 5. This implies that exchange rate depreciation can correct a balance of payments, deficit in the country. The reality on ground does not however support this due to the predominance of crude oil export in the country's total exports. The negative signs in some of the coefficients of the entries under real exchange rate in the I-R functions of the foreign reserves model also showed that exchange rate depreciation impacted positively on foreign reserves. The entries in the first, third and fifth quarters were 0, -0.028 and -0.023 respectively. This is similar to the results from the variance decomposition analysis where, after own shocks, innovations from the country's trading partner's GDP and the real exchange rate with almost equal values ranked next. This implies that a depreciation of the exchange rate would lead to an increase in the country's level of foreign reserves.In conclusions, the ability of depreciation to correct the country's balance of payments deficit over the years has been constrained by the predominance of crude oil in the country's total exports because the price and export quota of the country's crude oil are determined by exogenous forces  the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is one of such forces.|Theses Collection|Exchange rate/Exchange rate depreciation/foreign exchange market/deregulation of the Naira/balance of trade/foreign reserves/international finance theory/IMF/Statistical Bulletin of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)/nominal exchange rate/Vector Autoregressive (VAR)/impulse response (I-R) functions/exchange rate stability/balance of payments/Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)*||||||Abogunja, Oladunni Florence|F|Some patterns of linguistic deviation in selected poems of Thomas Hardy||||||M.A. English Language|A.B.

The specific aims of the study were to identify and classify the different levels of linguistic deviation manifested in language usage in Thomas Hardy's poems and to find out the thematic implications of such usage of language.Appropriate literature on deviation and linguistic analysis of literary texts was reviewed. A number of poems by Thomas Hardy was studied in depth and ten of them were selected for specific attention. The ten poems were chosen based on the different periods of his writing. Examples of linguistic deviation from the poems were categorized, analyzed and interpreted from the perspective of linguistic stylistics. The systemic linguistics model was used in the linguistic analysis of the texts.The patterns of deviation mainly observed were the inversion of clause structure and collocational clash or breaking the rules of selectional restriction.It was further discovered that the poet used the personal pronoun like "he", "she", to refer to inanimate objects, thereby violating the semantic rules that guide subject-verb relationship. It was also observed that through the use of linguistic deviation, Thomas Hardy was able to express his closeness to and profound and passionate love for nature.In conclusion, the study has shown that a linguistic stylistic analysis of the linguistic structure of literary texts can help us to analyse and interpret the textual messages with greater insight.|Theses Collection|Linguistic/stylistic/Thomas Hardy/linguistic deviation/language usage/thematic implications/literature/sytemic linguistics model/clause structure/collocational clash/subject-verb relationship*||||||Chukwuemeka, Agbakwuru Barnabas|M|The psychological impact of oil exploration on the indigenes of the Delta State, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

It aimed at assessing the impact of oil exploitation on the quality of life of the indigenes of the sampled communities in Delta State. The relationship between the demographic variables of gender, age, level of education and occupation, and the perception of the impacts of oil exploitation by the indigenes were also examined.  An ex-post-facto exploratory design was used for the study. Total sample sizes of 280 subjects participated in the study, with 202 (72.1%) males and 78 (27.9%) females, drawn from eight communities using both purposive and grab sampling. Two local governments (Ughelli South and Warri Southwest) were purposively selected to represent the onshore and offshore oil producing communities of Delta State respectively. The age of the participants ranged from 21-70 years, with a mean age of 39.28 years and S.D = 6.27years. For the purpose of analysis the age range was categorized into two levels: youths (21-40 years) and the elders (41-70 years). A single self-report paper-and-pencil questionnaire tagged: "Oil Communities Quality of Life Scale (OCQOLS)" was used to collect quantitative data for the study. This OCQOLS, a modified version of previous quality of life scale by the World Health Organization, assessed those impacts of oil exploitation perceived to influence the quality of life of the indigenes of oil producing communities. The data collected were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistical methods.  The study showed that oil exploitation impacted negatively on the quality of life of the indigenes, consequent on oil spills and gas flares that destroyed their environment, degraded their socio-economic lives, induced conflicts, influenced their sense of and way of life and produced aggressive behaviour in the people. The result further showed that gender and education has no significant effect on the respondents' perception of the impacts due to oil exploitation. However, the age of the indigenes significantly influenced their perception of the impacts, as the elders were observed to be more concerned with the effects of oil exploitation on their environment than the youths, except on the quality of life in which there was no age difference. In the same vein, occupational status of the respondents significantly influenced their perception of the impacts of oil exploitation.The study concludes that oil exploitation in the Niger Delta has directly and/or directly affected the indigenes quality of life and hence, the way of life. Thus, hostility, aggression and the consequent crises in the Niger Delta are devoid of political motivations, but the result of decades of oil exploitation, environmental degradation, economic deprivation and abuse of their fundamental human rights. |Theses Collection|*||||||Abo, Jerome Nechii|M|Effects of soil characteristics on the pollution of shallow wells from latrines and waste dumps in Ile-Ife||||||M.Sc.

The hygienic conditions at each well were observed. Total depth, static water level, separation distance and direction of all proximal latrines or waste dumps within 20 m radius were measured. Sub-surface disturbed and undisturbed soil samples and water samples were collected from each well using standard methods. The soil samples were analysed for grain size distribution, permeability and porosity, while the water samples were analysed to determine the concentrations of major ions, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and bacteria counts in the well water. Statistical analyses were performed using the contingency, one way analysis of variance, (ANOVA-1) and correlation tests. The hygienic conditions at the wells vary substantially and were associated with the presence of animal dung, decaying leaves, littered nylon, paper and other waste materials. The soils of the study area were classified into two broad textural groups of sandy clay loam and sandy clay. The former dominate the Iremo, Moore and Eleyele soils while the latter was dominant in only Oke-Ola soils. The sandy clay loam soil was characterized by higher sand (58.2 ± 12.2  61.0±15.6%) and lesser clay ( 22.6±14.0  33.5±8.5 %) contents than the sandy clay soil (50.4±17.6% sand and 35.8 + 14.3% clay). The sandy clay loam was also significantly (p<0.001) more permeable (39.19±45.18 mm/min) and more porous (29.13±6.47%) than the sandy clay (permeability: 23.58 + 61.75 mm/min and porosity: 23.12 ± 4.02%) suggesting that it has a greater potential to pass pollutants and contaminants from different sources. The concentrations of the major cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+) and major anions (Cl-, SO42- and NO3-) vary between all the sections of the study area, with significantly higher values of the ions recorded in Iremo and Moore than in Eleyele and Oke-Ola. The levels of DO and BOD (overall mean: DO; 4.18±0.77 mg 1-1 and BOD; 2.27±0.89 mg 1-1) suggested very low organic pollution of the groundwater samples. Bacteriological analyses indicated that heavier counts of coliform bacteria (1100 CFU/100 ml and more) and the presence of Escherichia coli, are associated with low hygienic conditions.In conclusion, analyses of the separation distances and direction of wells to latrines or waste dumps show that no safe distance occurred. This is because nearly all the wells are polluted due to the interactive effect of integrated leach fields from all the latrines or waste dumps on the shallow groundwater system.|Theses Collection|*||||||Adesina, Gabriel Olulakin|M|A study on the ecology of aquatic weeds and associated littoral vegetation of Jebba lake||||||Ph.D. Plant Science|O.A.

The objectives of the study were to document the nutrient status of Jebba Lake water, shoreline soils and bottom sediments; correlate the physico-chemical parameters studied with the macrophyte population along the shoreline and pelagic zones; evaluate the uses and develop management strategies for aquatic weeds of Jebba Lake.Systematic sampling method was used for data collection. Line transect was laid along the length of the Lake to establish twenty sampling points at 10 km interval round the lake to give a total of 10 sampling points each at the eastern and western sides of the lake. A sampling plot of 25 m2 was first established at the sampling points and later 1 m2 quadrant was laid on a line transect from the shoreline to the open water at the interval of 1 m. Data collections were carried out during the rainy and dry seasons of 1999 to 2001. Herbaceous plants both at the littoral zone and the open water and the woody species within each sampling plot were identified to species level. The woody species were subsequently enumerated. The data collected were plotted into the map of Jebba Lake. Shoreline soil, bottom sediment and water samples were collected and analysed to determine water temperature, transparency, pH, particle size distribution, organic matter, total nitrogen, phosphorus, cations and exchangeable acidity. These variables were used in multivariate analysis to assess their effects on weed species distribution.The lake water contained high concentrations of potassium, sodium, magnesium and calcium. Phosphorus and nitrogen were closely related to organic components of the soil and water. The conversion of river system to lake ecosystem changed the land use and land cover around Jebba Lake Basin. The development of weed species on the Lake was affected by the introduction of plant propagules through water discharge from Kainji Lake. The application of organic and inorganic fertilizer in mixed farming practices by the riparian communities indirectly enriched the Lake with nutrients thereby encouraging the development of aquatic weeds. The number of aquatic weed species identified on the Lake increased over the years, which was probably responsible for the high species diversity index of 3.8 obtained during the period of study. Emergent weeds formed about 93.3% of the total weed encountered. The most dominant weeds across all seasons were Vossia cuspidata Griff, Eichhornia crassipes (Mart) Solms-Laub, Mimosa pigra Linn, Vetiveria nigritana Benth Stapf, and Marsicus longibracteatus (Cherm). Sesbania dalzielii Phill & Hutch was dominant only during the rainy season due to its annual life span. The highest aquatic weed cover was recorded during the dry season when 686.64 ha (1.91%) was covered out of about 36,012 ha of the total surface area of the Lake. The lowest aquatic weed cover was recorded during the rainy season with about 615.19 ha or 1.71% of the whole lake surface area. The Lake weed cover on the average stood at about 1.81%. Organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus were identified as the key nutrients in both the bottom sediment and water that enhanced the weed infestation.|Theses Collection|Ecology/aquatic weeds/littoral vegetation/Jebba Lake/macrophyte population/pelagic zones/shoreline soils/herbaceous plants/organic matter/exchangeable acidity/Kainji Lake/Vossia cuspidata Griff/Eichhornia crassipes (Mart)/weed infestation*||||||Sanusi, Yemisi Mulikat|F|The variability of truth-value in English conditional sentences||||||M.A. English Language|C.O.

It also aimed at determining the role of conditionals in ascertaining the truthvalue of English conditional sentences. In an attempt to achieve these aims, the collected data were put into seven classes; lettered A to G which was carefully examined to show the different ways in which they occur and functions assigned to each of the classes. The functions made up the title under each class.Extensive library research was carried out for this research. Major works on semantics and grammar were carefully studied. Examples of English conditional sentences were obtained from both spoken and written news media, text books and introspective data. The analysis of some of the samples so collected was based on Tarski's theory of analyzing truthvalue in English conditional sentences.It was discovered that in the various classes to which the conditionals were put, there was an overlap between hyponymy and synonymy. It was also shown in the data that only class E had the four-way test for conditionals. By the four-way test for conditionals, it meant that if the antecedent of the conditional was true and the consequent was false, the conditional was false otherwise true. The possible occurrences of the conditional were noticed in class E, which was the class based on comparison.Thus, it was concluded that mood, setting, situationalitycontext, were central to our efforts to determine the truthvalue of English conditional sentences.|Theses Collection|English language/truthvalue/conditional sentences/semantics/grammar/Tarski's theory/hyponymy/synonymy*||||||Ogunyemi, Christianah Mojisola|F|Antisickling properties of carica papaya linn. and sorghum bicolor (L). moench||||||M.Sc.

(Caricaceae) and Sorghum bicolor (L) Moench (Poaceae) and to compare the potentials of various extractives of the two plants as antisickling agents, both individually and as mixtures.Mature, unripe, Carica papaya fruit pulp and leaves of S. bicolor were soaked separately in distilled water at room temperature for 1-7 days. The daily filtered aqueous extract sample obtained was used for the inhibitory and reversal antisickling assay by deoxygenation with sodium metabisulphite. The experiment was repeated on the mixture of S. bicolor leaf and C. papaya fruit pulp (1:1w/w). Antisickling assays were also carried out on the methanolic and chloroform extracts of the two plants while the methanolic extracts were screened for secondary metabolites using basic phytochemical methods.The methanol extracts of the C. papaya fruit pulp and S. bicolor leaf were found to contain carbohydrates, flavonoids, cardiac glycosides, steroids, alkaloids, tannins and terpenes. Saponins were absent in both S. bicolor leaf and C. papaya fruit pulp while cyanides were detected in S. bicolor only.The highest antisickling potencies of 87% and 74% for the inhibitory and reversal activities respectively were produced by the aqueous extract from the fermented 5th day sample of the C. papaya fruit pulp. The fermented 70th day sample of S. bicolor leaf gave the highest inhibitory activity of 51% and reversal activity of only 17%. The 1:1 w/w mixture of S. bicolor and C. Papaya fermented for 5 days possessed an inhibitory activity of 93% and reversal activity of 84%. The methanolic extract of C. papaya fruit pulp gave 64% inhibitory and 55% reversal activities while the methanol extract of S. bicolor as well as the chloroform extracts of each of C. papaya and S. bicolor were inactive. The study concluded that C. papaya and S. bicolor possess antisickling properties after fermentation. The activities were further enhanced when mixed in equal proportion thus justifying the traditional use of the mixture in the management of sickle cell anaemia.|Theses Collection|Carica papaya Linn/antisickling properties/Sorghum bicolor/deoxygenation/sodium metabisulphite/chloroform/metabolites/phytochemical methods/inhibitory activity/sickle cell anaemia *||||||Babalola, Adejoke Clara|F|Functional communication as a factor in participation in self-help development projects among adults in Osun State, Nigeria (1985 - 1999)||||||M.A. Adult Education|T.O.

In other words, the study tried to find out the type of communication strategies that can be employed for successful self-help promotion in our rural communities, and how these communication variables can be maximally used to ensure speedy development of our rural areas.The sample for the study consisted of 150 adults from each of the four selected local councils, making a total of 600 subjects, which were made up of the adult educators, community change agents and adult members of the communities. The adults were selected through a system of purposive random sampling which enabled the researcher to select those with cognate and relevant experience to supply the information needed. In each of the local council, the list of the adults involved in community development activities was first obtained after which a thorough screening was done to determine the suitability of those to be selected. Random Sampling Method was employed to select four local government areas from all the geographical zones in Osun State, which were then considered to be fair representatives of local councils in Osun State. Questionnaire and oral interview were the principal instruments of data collection. Three null hypotheses were raised for the study and the major technique of analysis was the t-test statistical method. The data collected was thereafter subjected to a thorough analysis, after which the results were discussed in line with the hypotheses developed for the study. The result of the data as regards the first hypothesis shows that there was statistically a significant difference in adult participation in self-help projects and different types of communication (t = 1.98, df = 1 198 and v = 0.05).

More specifically, it examined the impact of the exposure to literature on the acquisition of grammatical competence by Nigerian Senior Secondary School (SSS) students. Four hundred SSS III students randomly selected from ten schools in Osun State were classified into two groups. The first was made up of SSS students who registered for literature in English in the West African School Certificate Examination (WASCE) while the second group was made up of students who did not register for literature in English in the WASCE.Three instruments which comprised a reading comprehension passage, an expository and narrative essays and a reading preference questionnaire were administered to the pupils. The instruments were designed to ascertain the writing and reading competences of the students as well as their reading preferences. The inter/intra school responses of the subjects were compared and contrasted. The data were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics.The study showed that the literature and non-literature subjects had considerable problems in their reading and writing tasks. In addition, the data also revealed that there was no significant difference in the performances of the urban and rural schools subjects. However, students from the elitist schools performed better than those from the poorly equipped schools especially in the content and expression aspects of the narrative essay.From the analysis of the available data, the conclusion was that literature although helpful in the acquisition of grammatical competence was not the only factor responsible for the acquisition of grammatical competence of SSS students.

The samples were tested for various refractory properties.The results showed that sample mixes B (75 % fired kaolin with 25 % unroasted kaolin) and D (25 % fired kaolin with 75 % unroasted kaolin) had high levels of compressive strength, thermal shock resistance and bulk density and low shrinkage, porosity and permeability indices. Samples A (100 % fired kaolin with 0 % unroasted kaolin), C (50 % fired kaolin with 50 % unroasted kaolin) and E (0 % fired kaolin with 100 % unroasted kaolin) were of relatively poor refractory properties. However, the optimum material-mix for the refractory bricks was found to be 75% roasted kaolin mixed with 25% unroasted kaolin (Sample B).The study concluded that with particular reference to the highest load bearing capacity in terms of compression strength, thermal shock resistance, bulk density and relative porosity, sample (B) is therefore recommended for use in lining salt-bath austempering furnaces for the production of austempered ductile irons. |Theses Collection|Refractory properties/salt-bath/austempering furnaces/isothermal heat-treatment/*||||||Binuyo, Adeyemi Olukayode|M|Qualitative study of solutions for some sixth -order non -linear ordinary differential equations||||||M.Sc.

It was also shown that the solution is periodic (almost periodic) depending on the forcing term p(t) without solving the equations explicitly.To achieve these objectives effectively, the generalized theorem of Yacubovich via the frequency  domain technique was used. This approach was used to discuss the qualitative properties like boundedness, stability and periodicity of solutions for some considered sixth-order non-linear ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, maple V release 5.1 software packages were used to determine the values of some complicated expressions encountered in the work.Some related values like the determinant of the linear homogeneous part of the sixth-order ordinary differential equations was obtained. In addition, the well-known Routh-Hurtiwz conditions of stability for the sixth-order equations were determined. Furthermore, the local maximum and minimum points with their corresponding values were obtained by using the software packages. The results were(a)	[(ab-c) (cd  be) - (ad  e)2]e  cf [(ab-c) c-a2d] + a2 f (be-af) + aef (ab-3c) > 0(b)	S1 (m4) _ (be-af)/a  [(ab-c) c-a2d]/2a3 (c-(c2- 4ae) 1/2) - e (3c-(c2  4ae)1/2)(c)	S2 (ml) = 1/9 [3 (b (c-ab) + 2ad-3e) +1/2 p1/3 (3c-2ab) + 2p-1/3 (3d-b2) (2ab-3c)  a (1/4p2/3 (3 d-b2) 2)]where p = (4b (2b2-9d) 108f + 12 (3d2 (4d-b2)) + 6bf (2b2-9d) +81f2)1/2.

Purposive sampling approach was used to collect data Technology Business Incubation Centre managers, 10 officials of the Ministry of Science and Technology, 20 tenants within the Technology Business Incubation Centres (TBICs), and 20 entrepreneurs outside the TBICs through questionnaires and oral design interview. The questionnaires and the interview guide elicited information on issues such as biodata of respondents, facilities and services available, constraints facing the centre and possible solution, and performance of the TBI programme. Also secondary data were collected from existing records in the TBICs and Federal Ministry of Science and Technology. The data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics.The results indicated that 80% of entrepreneurs in the centres were male with educational qualification not less than Ordinary Level School Certificate.  About 81% of the participating companies were manufacturing organizations with the remaining 18% being service companies. The investigated companies indicated capital growth between 17.86  2,328.57%, and increased turnover between 40  15,500% within five years of the incubation period. There was significant difference in the level of innovation between SMEs within the incubator and those outside (x2 calculated = 122.7; tabled = 16.9). The average incubation period for graduated businesses was between 4.6 and 5.6 years. About 57% of tenants in Agege overstayed for 2.5 years while 69% of Kano tenants overstayed for 1.7 years on average. There is a weak correlation (r= -0.18 for Agege, and -0.07 for Kano) between the age of business before admission and the number of years of overstaying in the centre. Diffused local technology constituted 70  80% of technologies used by the TBIC tenants. The overall performance when measured against targets was rated above average (3.91) in terms of job creation and value addition, while it was below average in terms of corporate patronage and subcontracting (2.90), and self sustainability (2.80).The study concluded that the TBI programme facilitated the formation and growth of SMEs with high content of local technology as an engine of industrialization in Nigeria. |Theses Collection|Technology Business Incubator (TBI) Programme/commercialization/Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria/entrepreneurs/capital growth/turnover/incubation period/industrialization*||||||Adejumo, Akintoye Victor|M|Interest rates, inflation and the aggregate consumption function in Nigeria (1970 - 2001)||||||M.Sc.

It also tested for structural shift of the aggregate consumption function on the introduction of Nigeria's Structural Adjustment programme (SAP).The study used secondary data on the variables used for the analysis. The data were sourced from the Central Bank of Nigeria Publications and the International Financial Statistics Yearbook. The method of analysis was both descriptive and econometric. The descriptive method used tables and graphs to describe the trend and pattern of aggregate consumption in Nigeria, from 1970-2001. In the econometric estimation of the model, the augmented Dickey  Fuller (ADF) test was first used to examine the time series properties of the variables. Then, the Ordinary Least Squares method of estimation was used to examine the impact of inflation and interest rates on the aggregate consumption function. Finally, the Chow test was used to test for structural stability of the model before and after the introduction of the structural adjustment programme (SAP) in 1986.The main findings showed that for the entire period of the study, 1970-2001, interest rate positively influenced consumption. However the influence was insignificant at both 5% and 10% levels of significance. On the other hand, for the pre-SAP and post- SAP periods, the influence of interest rate on consumption was positively significant at both the 10% and 5% levels of significance, respectively. Conversely, it was found that inflation rate negatively influenced consumption at the 5% level of significance in all the three periods. The result of the Chow test showedthat there was a structural shift in the coefficients of the variables of the variables during the structural adjustment era. The calculated F- statistics of 32.8 was greater than the critical value of 2.66.The study concluded that the positive influence on consumption of interest rate was stronger in the adjustment and post-adjustment periods than in the periods preceding adjustment. By implication, the interest rate reforms under SAP could be said to have generated increased domestic consumption expenditures.|Theses Collection|Consumption expenditures/inflation rate/interest rates/aggregate consumption function/Nigeria's Structural Adjustment programme (SAP) 1986/Central Bank of Nigeria Publications/International Financial Statistics Yearbook/augmented Dickey  Fuller (ADF) test/ Chow test *||||||Fadehan, Godfred Danso|M|Mobility and biodegradation of spilt crude oil in a polluted soil remediated by burning||||||M.Sc.

One was burnt while the other was left unburnt. A third unpolluted and unburnt soil sample served as the control. All the soil samples were taken from the same area in lsiokpo-Oghodo, Rivers State to a depth of approximately 3.6 cm.The different soil horizons were identified following the classification of Wilhelm (1976) into their AI and A2 horizons which were mainly examined in this research work. Their physicochemical and other properties such as depth, soil colour, pH, porosity, moisture content, including the percentage of crude oil degraded were analyzed using standard methods. The presence and ability of the autochthonous bacteria in both polluted soil samples to degrade the oil were ascertained by culturing them in Mineral Salts Medium (MSM)  for seven days. The hexane-soluble residual crude oil recovered from both horizons was later analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography.The range of values for the investigated physicochemical parameters of the AI and A2 horizons of the unpolluted, unburnt and burnt soil samples respectively were: depth of AI horizons (0.7, 0.9. 0.9 cm); depth of A2 horizons (1.2, I.4, 1.3 cm): soil colour (brown, dark brown, black) and pH (5.13. 5.33, 6.51). Others were: oil degraded in Ai horizons (17.92, 58.25. 22.88 %); oil degraded in A2 horizons (23.30, 58.45, 15.54 %) moisture content (0.45, 0.44. 0.61 °/A) and a uniform porosity of 46.67 % for all the three samples. The spilt crude oil was only visible in the Ai and A2 horizons of the unburnt soil sample to a depth of 0.3 cm and 0.1 cm respectively.The A1 horizons of the soils contained more bacterial genera than the A2 horizons while a total of ten autochthonous crude oil-degrading bacteria made up of the following genera: Proteus, Aerococcus, Lactobacillus. Actinobacillus, Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Micrococcus, Corynebacterium, and Staphylococcus were isolated from the horizons of the burnt and unburnt soils. In addition to the last four genera, Chromobacterium and Streptococcus were also found in the horizons of the unburnt soil. Among all the bacterial genera isolated, Bacillus was found to he the most prominent as it was present in most of the soil horizons with the exception of the AI horizon of the burnt soil.The gas-liquid chromatographic analysis (GLC) of the residual oils revealed the presence of distinct and separated hydrocarbons ranging from C15 to C21 and occurring within a retention time of 15 to 27 minutes in the burnt and unburnt soils. A greater amount of crude oil was degraded in the horizons of the unburnt soil than in those of the burnt soil.The study concluded that the burning of crude oil polluted soils aid the downward Mobility of oil and also increase the proliferation of autochthonous bacteria but does not encourage much degradation of the oil.|Theses Collection|Mobility/biodegradation/crude oil/soil environment/combustion/porosity/moisture content/gas-liquid chromatography/Mineral Salts Medium (MSM)/autochthonous bacteria/physicochemical parameters *||||||Ajayi, Bababunmi Alaba|F|Evaluation of the reproductive traits of Nigeria indigenous pig, large white and their crossbred in the humid tropics||||||M.Sc.

The record consisted of 257, 35 and 25 litters of (i) NIP x NIP, (ii) LW x LW and (iii) LW x NIP respectively sired by 43 boars and 136 sows. The reproductive traits studied included individual birth weight, litter birth weight, litter size at birth, individual weaning weight, litter weaning weight, litter size at weaning and sex ratio at birth. The heritability estimates from the sire component of variance of these traits were also determined. Significant differences (P<0.01) among the breeds were detected using Duncan's New Multiple Range Test.The results showed that individual birth weights were 0.93 ± 0.02, 1.18 ± 0.02 and 1.02 ± 0.01 kg for NIP x NIP, LW x LW and LW x NIP, respectively. The corresponding weaning weights were 4.03 is 0.55, 4.74 is 0.16 and 5.29 ± 0.15 kg. Breed effect was significant (P < 0.01) for the two traits. The litter birth weights were 5.44 ± 0.12, 8.89 +0. 43 and 5.28 ± 0.28 kg and those of litter weaning weights were 23.39 ± 0.55, 34.45+2.86 and 27.09+1.80 kg, respectively. Average litter sizes at birth were 5.82 ± 0.11, 7.49 ± 0.35 and 5.16 ± 0.29 for NIP x NIP, LW x LW and LW x NIP, respectively with corresponding lister sizes at weaning of 5.53 ± 011, 5.83 0.46 and 4.84 ± 0.32 kg. Overall sex ratio of males to females was 1:1.04. Heritability estimates for these traits ranged from 0 to 1.32.It was concluded that NIP, in terms of the relative number of piglets weaned, was better adapted to the tropical environment than the LW. However, the heritability estimate for this trait in NIP was lower compared to LW indicating that selection for this trait in NIP would be family selection.|Theses Collection|*||||||Ajisafe, Rufus Adebayo|M|Commercial Banks Portofolio composition and their impact on economic activity in Nigeria (1970 - 1999)||||||M.Phil.

The study aimed at examining the channels through which banks loans and investments influences the economy; examining the effects of loans and investments on Gross Domestic Product (GDP).Our study made use of secondary data obtained from Central Bank of Nigeria's Statistical Bulletin; and Annual Reports and Statement of Accounts. Data were also sourced from the International Financial Statistics (IFS). Descriptive and Econometrics analyses were employed in analysing our data. In the descriptive analysis, we made use of tables, charts, ratios and percentages while in the area of econometrics, we employed the use of Error Correction Modeling (ECM) technique. This method was adopted in order to overcome the spurious result that may arise when using time series data. The method also shows the relationship that exists between the dependent and the independent variables in the long run.The result of the analysis shows that there exist a strong relationship between the explanatory variables and the dependent variable. This can be seen from the result of the Coefficient of Determination (R2), which explains about 78 percent of the variations in the dependent variables. Also a positive relationship existed between the loans and Gross Domestic Product after two years. This means that loans and advances given to the people cannot have an immediate impact on the economy. That is, it will take at least two years before it can generate its 'own income. In the same vein, the investment portfolio of the bank also contributes significantly to theeconomy after the first year. Other variables in the model also contribute significantly to the development of the economy.  The study thereby concludes that banks loans and investment variables have a greater and positive impact on the Gross Domestic Product within the period of study. Also the variables constitute an important linkage between the monetary sector and the real sector of the economy.|Theses Collection|*||||||Ojo, Olufunmilayo Theresa|F|Correlates of friendship formation among Obafemi Awolowo University undergraduate students||||||M.A. Guidance & Counselling|J.A.

The specific objectives of the study are to identify the types of development control measures in operation in the study area, examine the influence of development control measures on housing and neighbourhood quality and assess the relationship between housing and neighbourhood qualities and residential rental values.Stratified random sampling was adopted in the distribution of questionnaires to the tenants, landlords and estate firms. Statistical tools employed in analyzing data based on interval scale of measurement were frequency distributions, percentages, relative importance indices, Pearson's product moment correlation, multiple regression analysis and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).The main findings of the research were that: there exist low and positive correlations between development control variables and housing quality and between development control variables and neighbourhood quality (R= 0.3289 and O. 31357 respectively). In addition, the correlation between housing and neighbourhood quality with residential rental value is low and positive (R= 0.4618).The implication is that, efficiency in the implementation of the development control measures may not improve the housing and neighbourhood qualities. The same is also true between housing and neighbourhood qualities and residential rental values. However, some development control variables such as total number of habitable room, zoning, standard of room and internal parking space have a significant effect on residential rental values in the study area (R= 0.94374). Hence, some development control measures have impact on residential rental values.

The external part was a public key cipher while symmetric key cipher and pseudo random sequence formed the internal part. The public key cipher was based on the principles of the knapsack algorithm, while the symmetric key cipher was used as seed for generating random sequence of sixteen numbers between 0 and 255. The random sequence produced the 128 bits key, which was the security backbone of the encryption and decryption component of the algorithm. The algorithm was implemented using Visual Basic programming language. Encryption and decryption of sample messages were then carried out.The results of sample messages encrypted and decrypted showed that the average speed for encryption and decryption using 651MHz processor were 8994 bits/s and 17656 bits/s respectively. The cipher-text length was approximately thrice as much as that of the plain text. The breaking of the cipher-text involve the trial of 2128 possible key combinations, which means that an hacker that succeeded on the one-tenth of the possible keys of (2128), and having a computer capable of trying 1000 keys per nanosecond will require nothing less than 10 13 years to complete. The decrypted message was error free. Furthermore, the encrypted data were secured against the three forms of network attacks that were preventable through cryptography.The study concluded that the cryptographic algorithm developed was therefore computational secured and efficient in the use of the communication channel. Furthermore, the capability of this program was comparable to that of commercial software in use, and was suitable for secure transference of files across all kinds of digital communication network.|Theses Collection|Software/algorithm/cryptography/key cipher/encryption/decryption/Visual Basic programming language/software development*||||||Ibhafidon, Inegbenoise Lawrence|M|Effects of particulate matter on human health in residential indoor environment in Ile-Ife||||||M.Sc.

The foal of the study was to identify the exposed population with highest health risk of indoor respirable particulate matter.The study was carried out at three different locations: Agbogbo village. Olonode, and Obafemi Awolowo University senior staff quarters between December 2001 and November 2002. These locations represent the part of Ile-Ife where firewood, kerosene, and LPG respectively are mostly used for cooking. The study involved three dimensional data collection procedures: assessment of indoor PM10 using a stacked PM10 sampler, measurement of lung function using a Vitalograph bellows spirometer, and administration of a Modified British Medical council questionnaire to 90 male and female subjects selected from these three locations.The results showed that mean (x±s.d) PM10 concentration in residences with LPG was 80.8 ±9.5µg/m3, kerosene 236.9±265.3µg/m3 and firewood 269.4±93.7µg/m3 respectively. Also, subjects who cook with LPG had significantly high (p<0.01) lung function (FVC and FEV1) values of 3.81±0.67 and 3.37±0.59 litres respectively as compared with kerosene and firewood subjects with 3.081±0.67; 2.69±0.6 litres and 2.66±0.5; 2.12 ± 0.38 litres respectively. Generally, higher (57.1%) proportion of subjects who cook with LPG reported the least (23.8%) prevalence of symptoms.The study further revealed that subjects who cook with firewood and were of relatively low social and economic status had the highest potential daily exposure of 505.1ugh/m to indoor PM, while those with LPG had the least exposure of 13.3µgh/m daily. coefficient between residential indoor PM10 concentration and lung function (FEV and FVC) was negative(-0.95 and -0.98) respectively. On the other hand, correlation between indoor PM10 may lead to increase in prevalence of respiratory symptoms and decrease in lung function of exposed subjects. Of these types of cooking fuel commonly used in Ile-Ife, cooking with LPG in indoor environment exposes subjects to least concentration of respirable particles (PM10) while subjects who cook with firewood are to at highest health risk of indoor respirable particulates.|Theses Collection|Human health/respirable particulate matter/aerodynamic diameter/residential indoor environment/population/Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG)/kerosene/firewood/economic status *||||||Idowu, Thomas Oyebode|M|Bioactivity -guided fractionation of the seeds of Chrysophyllum Albidum G.

The crude methanolic extract of the seed cotyledons was partitioned successively between water and organic solvents, ethylacetate and n-butanol to locate the any observed activity. Acid-base extraction of the n-butanolic fraction was carried out and isolation of the compounds was achieved through repeated column chromatography using Accelerated Gradient Chromatography (AGC) and preparative thin layer chromatography (PTLC).The observed antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities were retained in the n-butanolic fraction, which tested positive for alkaloids. Chromatographic separation of the alkaloid fraction monitored by antimicrobial tests led to the isolation of eleagnine (1,2,3,4- tetrahydro-l-â-carboline). 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1, 2 -dimethyl-â-carboline and skatole (3- methylindole). The structures of the compounds were elucidated by the use of 1Hnmr, 13Cnmr, 2D nmr, UV and MS data. Eleagnine was found to possess  the highest antimicrobial activity, Candida albicans (MIC 1.25mg/ml) and Candida pseudotropicalis (MIC 250µg/ml), Escherichia coli (MIC 500µg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 62.5µg/ml), Psedomonas  aeruginosa (MIC 500µg/ml) and Bacillus subtilis (MIC 250µg/ml) followed by 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1,2-dimethyl-â-carboline while skatole possessed no activity.

Graded doses of chloroquine were administered intraperiloneally (i.p.) to rats and mice grouped into 8 animals each respectively. The animals were observed for novelty-induced rearing (NIR), wet dog shake (WDS) and convulsion. These reactions were then reexamined 15 mins alter the pretreatment with morphine (MO) as an agonist. The experiment was also repeated using naltrexone (NAL), ketocyclazocine (KCZ) and diazepam (DZM) as antagonists. The results show that chloroquine (CQ 5mg and 20mg/kg enhanced NIR in rats and mice compared with saline controls. Low dose of morphine (MO 0. 1 mg/kg) increased NIR in both rats and mice, while a higher dose of (MO 1 mg/kg) inhibited NIR compared to saline controls. However, at a moderate dose of 0.5mg/kg, Mo did not alter NIR in both rats and mice. Pretreatment with MO 0.5 or l mg%kg decreased the CQ (20mg/kg)-induced NIR enhancement in rats and ('Q (10 or 20mg/kg) in mice. Administration of NAI, at 0.25mg/kg,a dose, which blocks mainly p-opioid receptors, did not alter CQ (20mg/kg)  enhancement of NIR. However, a higher dose of 2.5mg/kg which blocks la. K and 6-opioid receptors decreased CQ (20mg/kg) enhancement of NIR in both rats and mice. This higher dose of NAL precipitated opiate-like abstinence syndrome manifested as WDS and convulsions in animals pre-treated with CQ (20mg/kg) 15 mins prior. Interestingly, NAL. (0.25mg/kg 15 min prior) increased CO (10mg/kg) -- enhancement of NIR. However, a higher dose of NAL (2.5mg/kg) inhibited CO (10mg/kg) enhancement or NIR in rats and mice.The administration of CQ (20mg/kg) induced convulsions in 33.3% of MO-tolerant  rats. However, MO (0.5mg or 1mg/kg did not alter the incidence of CQ (100mg/kg)  induced convulsion in mice. Only the higher dose of NAL, (2.5mg/kg 15 mills prior) significantly reduced the percentage of mice convulsing by 82% when CO 100mg/kg was administered. Ketocyclazocine (0.01 mg/kg) pretreatment also reduced the incidence of CO (100mg/kg) induced convulsions by 30%. Diazepam (DZM 1mg/kg 15 rains prior) also significantly reduced the percentage of CQ ( I00mg/kg)-induced convulsions in mice by 60%.The study concluded that p or 6 opioid receptors were involved in CO enhancement of NIR in rats and mice and 6 receptors also arc involved in CO induced seizure in mice and in MO tolerant rats respectively. This suggested the involvement of endogenous released opioids in these induced excitatory behaviours.|Theses Collection|Opioid system/chloroquine/intraperiloneally/novelty-induced rearing (NIR)/agonist/ketocyclazocine (KCZ)/antagonists/morphine/opioid receptors*||||||Akanmu, Omotayo Mutalib|M|Effects of folk and exogenous media on acquisition of numeracy skills in two modes of learning in adult literacy class||||||Ph.D. Educational Technology|D.K.

It examined the effects of exogenous media on the acquisition of numeracy skills among learners in adult literacy class. The study also determined the effects of cooperative and competitive modes of learning as intervening variables in the acquisition of numeracy skills in adult literacy class.A quasiexperimental, pre-test, post-test group design was employed in the study. Adult learners in the adult literacy programme of Osun State were used for the study. 84 subjects selected randomly from 14 randomly selected local government areas of the state were used for the study. This formed an average of 6 subjects from each of the selected local government areas. The subjects were later assigned to treatment groups. There were four groups in all  three experimental groups and one control group. Each of the experimental groups had two sub-groups exposed to cooperative and competitive learning conditions respectively. There were 12 subjects in each group of the cooperative and competitive learning conditions. Thus, there were 24 subjects for each of the three experimental groups. The first experimental group was exposed to folk media package while the second was exposed to exogenous media package. The third was exposed to a combination of folk and exogenous media package while the control group was exposed to the normal classroom competitive method without any type of media package. The control group had 12 subjects. Two types of instrument were used for the study. These were stimulus and response instruments. The stimulus response comprised the folk and exogenous media while the response instrument comprised the Number Achievement Test made up of 25 multiple choice objective test items. The data collected were analysed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Multiple classification analysis (MCA) was used to detect the magnitude and direction of effects. When significant differences were noted the Scheffe  post - Hoc test was used to determine the actual source of differences noted in the ANCOVA. The t  test statistical analysis was used to analyse the gain scores for each experimental group. The results of the study revealed that there was a significant main effect of treatment on adult learners' acquisition of numeracy skills F(3:83) = 55.92; P<0.05). Learning modes have a significant main effect on adult learners' acquisition of numeracy skills F (1:83) = 112.38, P<0.05). Similarly, the treatment and learning modes had significant interactive effects on adult learners' acquisition of numeracy F (3:83) = 12.34; P<0.05. On the whole, it was found that adult learners who used a combination of folk and exogenous media under cooperative learning condition performed significantly better (mean=13.9) than their counterparts in the control group (mean=1.58). Those under cooperative learning condition exposed to folk media package performed better (mean 10.1) than those exposed to exogenous media package (mean = 6) and than those in control group (mean = 1.58). Those exposed to exogenous media under cooperative learning condition performed better (mean = 6) than those in the control group (mean = 1.58). It was discovered also that all the groups exposed to the cooperative learning condition performed significant better (mean10.1) than those exposed to competitive learning condition (mean=6.1).It was concluded from the results of this study that folk and exogenous media, as approaches in instruction, should be encouraged. Cooperative learning conditions should also become an integral part of instructional approaches in adult literacy classes.|Theses Collection|Folk Media/adult literacy/exogenous media package/Scheffe  post - Hoc test*||||||Olayide, Abiodun|M|Impact of information technology on the operations of the hospitality industry in southwestern Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

The data used for this study were collected from customers, Hotel Managers, Front Office Managers, Food and Beverage Manager, Housekeepers and Information Technology Managers in 17 purposively selected hotels in southwestern Nigeria consisting of all categories of hotels. Data collection was done with the aid of questionnaires and oral interview on the operational problems often encountered and potential impact of information technology on the solutions to the problems on lodging, security and service section. Likert raring scale and descriptive statistics were used for data analysis.The work showed that there were operational problems in the lodging, security, and service sections of the studied hotels. The severity of problems identified included reservation/booking (3.3), transaction/payment (2.8), inefficient housekeeping (3.3), and lack of information technology resources in the hotel rooms (3.2) based on the 5-point Likert scale. In the security section, identified problems included pilfering of materials of the hospitality firm (3.3), absconding of lodgers (3.2), lack of distress call device (2.2), safety of guest and their properties (3.8), tracing of misplaced items by the lodger /staff (3.2) and manual  inventory system. (3.1). Finally, the identified operational problems in the service section included manual menu system (2.7), inconsistency in meal preparation (3.2), manual payment system (3.1) and inability to forecast the peak period of customers (3.3). The findings also showed that 29% of selected hotels made use of computer for their billing systems and reservation. The use of these systems engendered speedy service delivery, reduction of waiting line problems and minimization of error due to manual operation. Results also indicated that sophisticated information technology like reservation through wireless device and virtual front desk were not available in any of the hotels while 6% of the hotels studied use infra-red wireless door lock system. However, Local Area Network (LAN) and teleconferencing and electronic mail were in use in 33% of the selected hotels. In addition, on 5-point Likert rating scale, the aggregate potential impacts of information technology in providing solutions to the operational problems in lodging, security and service as revealed were 3.6, 3.5 and 3.5 respectively indicating high effects.The study concluded that effective and efficient delivery of high quality hospitality services in the country would be enhanced when appropriate information technology solutions were implemented.|Theses Collection|Information technology/hospitality industry/hotels/security/Local Area Network (LAN)/teleconferencing/electronic mail *||||||Ibeh, Olusola Olubunmi|F|Studies on the identification and distribution of simulium damnosum cytospecies of human onchocerciasis in southeastern Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Zoology|J.A.

The studies were undertaken for a period of 12 months to ascertain the seasonal variation and changes in the species composition. Simulium samples collected from different biocological zones (typical rainforest, mosaic forest, degraded forest, mosaic/guinea savannah and forest interphase/transitional zone) were analysed to ascertain the geographical variation in the species composition. This was to determine the identities and geographical distribution of the vectors of onchocerciasis in the area.The prospecting of 29 rivers for Simulium larvae was carried out and the endemic communities around the positive rivers were selected for sample collections. Adult female flies that were caught on human baits and those obtained from reared pupae were analysed using the colour of the fore coxa, ninth abdominal tergite setae, arculus, wing tuft and scutellar setae. The larvae, which were collected simultaneously were fixed in Carnoy's solution (3 parts absolute ethanol: 1 Part glacial acetic acid) and cytogenetic analysis was carried out on the basis of polythene chromosome banding patterns, sex chromosome variation and other chromosomal micromorphological features.Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and correlation coefficient were used to determine the relationship between morphological and cytological identifications. The geographical distribution and seasonal movement of the different cytospecies of Simulium damnosum complex were mapped using autoshapes in Microsoft Word.Out of the 29 rivers prospected, 9 were found to be positive for Simulium breeding and only 3 out of these were positive in both seasons. Adult female flies were collected in the dry season in 8 of the sites while in one; collection was in the rainy season. No adult fly was collected in one of the sites. Three out of the 9 West African sibling species were observed. Simulium squamosum sensu stricto and Simulium yahense, belonging to the Simulium squamosum sub-complex, were identified from the forest/mountainous areas while Simulium damnosum sensu stricto of the Simulium damnosum sub-complex, was identified from all the bioecological zones. The transitional zone however had a mixture of these vector species. On the basis of sex chromosome variation, two cytotypes of Simulium squamosum, ICs and ICb were identified from 4 sample sites. Although the ICb variant had been observed in the River Sanaga in Central Cameroon, this is the first time it is being identified anywhere in Nigeria, indicating its recent spread across the Cameroonian borderWith the exception of Simulium yahense, the morphological and cytological identifications of the other cytospecies showed a very good correlation (i.e. P < 0.05). The seasonal abundance and geographical distribution of the three cytospecies generally conformed to that which had been observed in other areas of West Africa, with the exception of Simulium damnosum which was generally more plastic in its distribution. The specific identities of the vectors of onchocerciasis in the study area have been inferred through larval cytotaxonomy. However, there is still a need for a reliable means of genetic identification of the adult Simulium since they are actually the ones that transmit the disease.|Theses Collection|Morphologiy/cytogenetic studies/Simulium damnosum complex/seasonal variation/biocological zones/onchocerciasis/Carnoy's solution/chromosome *||||||Adisa, Hannah Omobolanle|F|Bacterial isolates and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in sick infants in Ile-Ife and environment||||||M.Sc.

Samples were collected from skin, ear, anterior nare and eye of these subjects with the aid of sterile cotton-tipped applicators. Blood samples were obtained by venous puncture and cleansing of the skin area with 70% ethanol. Each swab was inoculated onto culture media containing Mannitol salt agar, MacConkey agar plates. The blood samples were inoculated into Thioglycolate broth and Brain Heart infusion broth respectively. All samples were incubated at 37°C initially for 48 hours; those cultures in which growth were observed were screened.Each bacterial colony that appeared on the growth media was first Gram stained and further characterized using conventional bacteriologic methods. The bacterial isolates were then tested for their antibiotic susceptibility profile in order to device ways of controlling infections caused by them.The results showed that Staphylococci constituted 205 (68.94%) of total number of bacterial isolates encounted with coagulase positive Staphylococci being 158 (52.8%) of these. Coagulase negative Staphylococci accounted for 47 (16.2%) and Gram negative rods were 48 (16.25%).Thirty percents of the subjects were bacteremic.The in vitro-antibiotic sensitivity testing revealed 46% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were resistant to cotrimoxazole, 35% of these were resistant to tetracycline, and 27% resistant to amoxicillin. Resistance to augmentin amongst these S.aureus strains was (21%), and (16.8%) of these were also resistant to cloxacillin. In addition (15.8%) of bacterial isolates were resistant to erythromycin, (13%) to chloramphenicol, (4.95%) to nalidixic acid respectively. Only (1%) of S.aureus was resistant to nitrofurantoin.The study shows the prevalence of cotrimoxazole resistant S.aureus isolates in this environment which is of epidemiological significance for the prevention and control of septicaemic cases.In conclusion the study showed staphylococci as the predominant bacteria recovered from these infants and S aureus being the commonest 158 (53%).The result also showed the prevalence of resistant staphylococci in this group .The in  vitro antibiotic sensitivity testing showed 46% of S.aureus isolates were resistant to cotrimoxazole,35% to tetracycline and 27% to amoxicillin drugs used in first line treatment of bacterial agents according to the Integrated Management of Childhood illnesses (IMCI) recommendation.|Theses Collection|Bacterial/antimicrobials/Paediatrician/sterile/ethanol/inoculation/Mannitol salt agar/MacConkey agar plates/Brain Heart infusion/Staphylococci/Coagulase/in vitro-antibiotic sensitivity/cotrimoxazole/tetracycline/amoxicillin/nalidixic acid/ Integrated Management of Childhood illnesses (IMCI)     *||||||Ayoka, Abiodun Oladele|M|Neuropharmacological effects of  Spondias mombin L.

Different doses of the aqueous, methanolic and ethanolic extracts were administered to 5 groups with 6 rats per group to examine the toxicity of the extracts. The experiment was repeated using mice. The extracts were administered by oral and intra peritoneal (i.p.) routes to determine the lethal dose (LD50). All the other experiments below were performed using i.p. administration. The effects of the three extracts in groups of animals were determined on novelty -induced rearing (NIR), by counting the frequency of occurrence. The NIR study was reevaluated after pretreatment with flumazenil, yohimbine, naltrexone, atropine. 15 mills before extracts administration, exobarbitone-induced sleeping time was assessed in groups of animals that received the extracts 30 mins before hexoharbitone. The stereotypy effect of extracts was also examined in mice induced by amphetamine and apomorphine, respectively.  The anticonvulsant activity' was carried out in mice using pentylenetetrazol, picrotoxin and strychnine induced convulsions.The results showed that oral administration of all the three extracts were not toxic in both animals. The LD50 following injection of ethanolic extract was 0.48g/kg for mice and 0.62g/kg for rat. the methanolic extract was 1.1 g/kg for mice and 1.08g/kg for rats, while the LD50 after aqueous extract injection was I.36g/kg, or nice and 1.42g/kg for rats. The three extracts decreased the novelty-induced rearing (NIR) in mice and rats in a dose-dependent manner.	Flumazenil (2.00mg/kg) increased basal NIR. However, the pre-treatment of flumazenil (2.00mg/kg 15 minutes prior) did not alter the inhibitory effect of the three extracts on NIR. Yohimbine (1 mg/kg) and naltrexone (0.25mg/kg) decreased NIR in mice compared with saline control. The inhibitory effect of the extracts on NIR was enhanced by yohimbine (2mg/kg, 15 minutes prior) and naltrexone (0.25mg/kg, 15 minutes prior). Atropine (0.5mg/kg) did not alter basal NIR and inhibitory effect of the extracts on NIR in mice. The extracts potentiate the hexoharbital (100mg/kg)-induced sleeping time in a dose dependent manner (P < 0.05). The potentiation of hexobarbitone (100mg/kg)-induced sleeping time was blocked by flumazenil, a gamma-amino butyric acidË, (GABAË) antagonist. The three extracts had protective effects on leptazol (85.0mg/kg) and picrotoxin (14.0mg.kg)-induced seizures but had no effect on strychnine-induced seizures. The ethanolic extract was more potent in the protection against Iepla/ol- and picrotoxin-induced convulsions when compared with methanolic and aqueous extracts. The extracts reduce amphetamine (35mg/kg) - and apomorphine (5mg/kg)-induced stereotyped behaviour in mice (P< 0.05). The number of writhes induced by 0.6% acetic acid was decreased by the extracts (P< 0.05). Naltexone (0.25mg/kg) abolished the inhibitov' effect of the extracts on 0.6% acetic acid induced writhes. The study demonstrated that the extracts of Spunclius nronihin possessed potent sedative, analgesic, anticonvulsant, anti-dopaminergic and GABA facilitatory properties, which justified the ethno medicinal use of the plant in neurological/psychiatric disorders.|Theses Collection|Neuropharmacology/methanolic/ethanolic extracts/sonatas mombin leaves/traditional medicine/lethal dose/novelty -induced rearing/hexoharbitone/pentylenetetrazol/anti-dopaminergic/ GABA facilitatory properties*||||||Falade, Olumuyiwa Sunday|M|Investigation of some chemical compounds and their nutritional values in seeds of selected Acacia species||||||Ph.D. Applied Chemistry|S.R.A.

Chemical analysis of seeds of Acacia colei and Acacia tumida were conducted via proximate analysis. Colorimetric methods were employed for the estimation of concentrations of amino acids, total sugar, phytate, tannin, trypsin inhibitors and true protein. True protein was also estimated by precipitation method, total fibre was by enzymatic/gravimetric method, fatty acids by gas chromatography (GC) method while total and available mineral was by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) method. The seeds were screened for secondary metabolites (saponins, alkaloids, tannins and flavonoids) using standard detecting agents. The nutritional studies were carried out by feeding Wistar rats with amino acid supplemented Acacia based diets, and casein with S- carboxyethylcysteine.The results of the study revealed that the value of crude protein ranged between 23.4 % and 30.6 % while true protein value was between 19.9 % and 25.0 %. The dietary fibre was between 31.9 % and 49.9% while total sugar was between 9.0 % and 16.1 %. Linoleic acid was the prominent fatty acid. Potassium was the highest mineral (443.0-934.0 mg/g), followed by calcium (168.4-274.0 mg/g), magnesium (153.0-290.0 mg/g), iron (18.0-54.4 mg/g), and zinc (2.3-5.0 mg/g) while trace minerals (lead, cadmium and cobalt) were low. The available iron was found to be low (2.0 % and 7.9 %) but that of other minerals were adequate. Trypsin inhibitors (18.0-24.5 TIU/g) and phytate (0.03-0.09 mg/g) levels were low but tannin (66.0-86.7 mg/g) content was high. The values obtained for amino acid residues; were tryptophan (2.32 - 2.91), methionine (2.89-3.58), cysteine/cystine (2.95-3.35) and lysine 3.08-3.89 g/100g protein. Nutritional evaluation showed that rats on Acacia colei and Acacia tumida diets gained weight with protein efficiency ratio (PER) of 3.31 each. The supplementation study showed--that- Acha (methionine rich seed) was the best complement for Acacia protein, while red sorghum performed better than millet. Cassava and corn starch Acacia based diets resulted in morbidity and mortality. The supplementation of both processed A. colei and A. tumida with methionine caused increase in weight and PER. The animals on 20 % (w/w) Acacia/millet diet was observed to be the best followed by casein diet while the least was observed with 40 % (w/w) Acacia/millet diet. Bioassay also revealed that methionine supplemented A. colei diet gave the highest value for all the nutritional and growth parameters followed by cysteine while tryptophan gave the least. Incorporation of S- carboxyethylcysteine into casein diets interfered negatively with protein utilization. Reproductive performance of Wistar rats fed with 0, 20 and 40 % (w/w) A. colei diets showed that Acacia had no adverse elect on reproductive organs of the animals as they reproduced successfully on Acacia based diet.In conclusion, the study revealed that A. colei and A. tumida are nutritious and could compete favourably with other legumes as a source of protein, minerals and other nutritional compounds. The chemical methods of amino acids determination also compared well with the use of sophisticated pieces of equipment.|Theses Collection|Chemical composition/nutritional values/Acacia seeds/amino acids/ Colorimetric methods/phulate/enzymatic/gravimetric method/gas chromatography/Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) method/metabolites/Wistar rats/S- carboxyethylcysteine/Linoleic acid/cysteine/methionine  *||||||Seweje, Olajumoke Christiana|F|An Evaluation of the study of German in Nigeria Educational Institutions||||||M.A. Foreign Languages|Sonaiya||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Foreign Languages|2004|||OAU|||||x,141p|||||||German||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The former was obtained through interviews with stakeholders (representatives of the German and Nigeria governments, lecturers of German, teachers of German in some private secondary schools, where German was being taught and their proprietors or principals). The latter was collected from available records from institutions teaching German in Nigeria to ascertain the available facilities. All the data collected were critically analysed and used in the discussion and evaluation of the teaching of the German language in Nigeria. The study employed historical  analytical model of analysis to examine the study of German in Nigeria.The results showed that the German language played (and continues to play) a significant role in fostering the economic, political and cultural ties between Nigeria and Germany. The examination of the conditions under which the German language was being taught in the institutions of learning showed that both the German government and the authorities of the three Universities awarding B.A. German degree had made various attempts to solve the problems facing the effective teaching and learning of the language, especially at the University level. These attempts included the award of scholarships to both students and lecturers of German, the sponsoring of a native German speaker from Germany as a lecturer in at least one of the three Universities and the donation of books and other teaching materials by the German government. The three universities where German was being taught also employed more lecturers of German to improve the staffing situation in their various institutions. The study also showed that the Nigerian language policy did not support the teaching of foreign languages with the exception of French, a situation which affected the stability and growth of the German language in Nigeria. It also showed the need to review the curriculum of teaching the language in Nigerian universities so as to improve the chalices of graduates of German securing employment both within and outside the country.The study concluded that the teaching of the German language in Nigeria was yet to stand on firm grounds.

Water samples from nearby wells and/or receiving streams were also taken for laboratory analyses of constituents.The results indicated that the infiltration rate and hydraulic conductivity of the non-impacted soil were significantly higher (P<0.05) than that of waste-impacted soils The soil aggregates were more stable as a result of the impact when compared with non-impacted soil conditions (P<0.05). There was no significant difference (P<0.05) between the values of the organic matter content and particle size distribution obtained in the impacted and non-impacted soil conditions. Analyses of water samples showed that the discharge of effluent into receiving stream led to higher pollution than when it percolated through the soil matrix into nearby wells. The total dissolved solids ranged from 269 to 735 mg/l; the nitrate value from 3.3 to S3.7 mg/l; total hardness from 166 to 362 mg/1; the biological oxygen demand (BOD) from 70 to 290 mg/l. The tolerable limits of cyanide in drinking water from the nearby wells were exceeded when compared to the acceptable limits of 0.2mg/l recommended in the environmental protection act. The study showed that high level of undesirable elements such as the cyanide and total solids are in the wastewater and a treatment would therefore be necessary to digest the pollutants and drop the coagulates before discharging it into the stream/environment. The partially treated wastewater can be used in controlling soil erosion especially on sandy soils because of the high starch constituent acting as a binding agent which led to an increase in the inter-particle binding forces. The soil-pore-clogging effect of the solid particles in the wastewater affected the permeability and infiltration rates negatively The study concluded that these findings would be valuable in building a database for the numerical solution of safe, pollution-free distance between cassava processing areas and nearby wells and ponds.|Theses Collection|Cassava/cassava waste effluent/soil properties/groundwater quality/soil hydraulic properties/ground water pollution/infiltration rate/organic matter/biological oxygen demand (BOD)/environmental protection act/pollutant/clogging *||||||Ebeshi, Benjamin Umar|M|Comparative bioavailability of proguanil following oral and rectal administration||||||M.Sc.

Various biological fluids such as urine, blood and saliva were collected before and at predetermined time intervals following administration of the drug. The biological samples were analysed with a simple and sensitive reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method developed in this study. Analysis was carried out on a C-18, 5µm reversed-phase column. The mobile phase of methanol: acetonitrile: 0.5% ammonium acetate and 75mM/L perchloric acid (40: 5: 55: 0.8) was pumped through the column at 1.2ml/min. The limit of detection for proguanil in both urine and plasma was 25ng/ml while the method showed good precision for proguanil and its metabolites with coefficient of variation less than 10%. Pharmacokinetic parameters were subsequently determined.Proguanil was found to be bioavailable from suppository in all the volunteers as proguanil was detected in both the plasma and urine obtained from the subjects. The relative bioavailability of proguanil suppository as compared to the tablet dosage form was found to be about 61% from both urine and plasma data. Proguanil was also found to be bioavailable at the same rate from the two formulations with maximum urinary excretion rate peaking at 3.6 ± 0.9 and 3.4 ± 0.8 h for the tablet and suppository respectively. This indicated that urinary excretion data can be used in the assessment of the bioavailability of the drug from suppository formulation. The mean elimination half-life of proguanil was found to be 15.04 ± 3.0 and 17.6 ± 6.1 h for the tablet and suppository respectively.The findings showed that proguanil suppository could be sufficiently bioavailable and may therefore be useful in chemoprophylaxis of malaria in sickle cell patients and children, particularly under such conditions that made oral route become impracticable.|Theses Collection|*||||||Soyinka, Julius Olugbenga|M|Bioactivity -directed fractionation of  Dissotis Rotundifolia (Sm.)

A 50% aqueous ethanol extract of the whole plant was partitioned with ethylacetate and n-butanol successively. The concentrated aqueous and organic fractions of each solvent were subjected to antimicrobial screening using typed strains of Escherichia coli (NCTC 10418), Bacillus subtilis (NCTC 8236), Staphylococcus aureus (NCTC 6571), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 10145), and Candida pseudotropicalis (NCYC 6) to situate activity. Bioactivity-guided (antimicrobial and antioxidant) chromatographic fractionation was then carried out in order to isolate the active compounds. The structure was elucidated by comparison of the spectroscopic data, especially 13CNMR values with the literature.Both the ethylacetate and n-butanolic fractions were found to show antimicrobial activity and a compound was isolated each from the butanolic and ethylacetate fractions. The compound from butanolic fraction showed antioxidant activity, but the structure could not be elucidated. The compound from ethylacetate showed no antioxidant activity, and the structure was found to be a mixture of two flavonoids vitexin and orientin. This study concluded that D. rotundifolia possessed antibacterial and antioxidant activities, thus, justifying its ethno-medicinal use in the treatment of rheumatism, painful swellings, sore-eyes and urinary tract infections.|Theses Collection|*||||||Adeyemi, Peter Oluseyi|M|Students'perception of lecturers'knowledge, attitudes and teaching skills as correlates of academic performance in two catholic seminaries in Oyo State||||||M.A. Psychology of Education|J.

It also investigated the influence of students' course of study and place of study on their perception of the selected variables.The research design adopted was survey. The study sample consisted of 510 students from Ss. Peter and Paul Catholic Major Seminary, Bodija, lbadan, and Dominican Institute of Philosophy and Theology, lbadan, where a sample of 350 and 160 students were randomly selected respectively. An instrument, "Rating of Students on Lecturers' Knowledge, Attitudes and Teaching Skills Questionnaire" (RSLK) was developed by the researcher. It is a test battery with four sections, of which three contain twenty items each. The reliability of the whole test is 0.80. The instrument was administered on the students personally by the researcher, with the cooperation of the lecturers. Data collected were analysed using Pearson Product Moment Correlation and t-test statistics. The tests were considered at the 0.05 level of significance.The results of data analyses revealed that a substantial proportion of the students, 427 respondents representing 83.7% had a positive perception of the selected variables investigated. While 83 respondents representing 16.3% had negative perception. The study revealed a significant positive correlation between students' academic performance and their perception of lecturers' knowledge of subject matter, (r = 0.372, p <0.05), attitude and academic performance (r = 0.239, p <O.05), and teaching skills and academic performance (r = 0.202, p <0.05). Students' institution of study did not have a significant influence on students' perception of lecturers' knowledge of subject matter (t = 1.62, p >0.05), attitude (t = 0.393, p >0.05) and teaching skills (t = 0.615, p >0.05). Finally, students' course of study did not have a significant influence on students' perception of lecturers' knowledge of subject matter (t = 1.02, p >0.05), attitude (t = 0.285, p >0.05) and teaching skills (t = 1.08, p >0.05). The study concluded that students' perception of their lecturers' knowledge of subject matter, attitudes and teaching skills are factors that have significant effects on students' academic performance.|Theses Collection|*||||||Alade, Gideon Oyewole|M|Isolation of antidiabetic constituents of Bauhinia Monandra Kurz (Caesalpinaceae) leaf||||||M.Sc.

The other groups were the diabetic negative control in which the diabetic rats were given 10% saline and the diabetic positive control where the diabetic rats were given glibenclamide (5mg/kg). The fourth group comprised normal rats given only 10% saline. Each group had 3 rats each. The level of glucose in the blood obtained from the tail vein was measured using a glucometer. The rats were made diabetic by intraperitoneal administration of alloxan monohydrate (160mg/kg) in 10% saline solution and fasted for 18 hours. Dried powdered plant material (4.15kg) was extracted cold with methanol. Graded doses of the extract were then administered to a group of the diabetic rats to determine the effective dose in another experiment. The extract was thereafter successively partitioned into ethylacetate, n-butanol and water and the activities of the resulting fractions were determined at 2g/kg in diabetic rats. The active butanolic fraction was then subjected to a bioactivity directed fractionation using vacuum liquid and column chromatographic methods. In addition, the insulin secetory potentials of these extracts/fractions were determined using an in vitro insulin secretory cell (INS-1) culture.The aqueous extract gave an insignificant 36% reduction of blood glucose while the methanolic extract (2g/kg) gave a significant (P < 0.05) activity at 4hr. The activity in the partitioned fractions was retained in the butanol fraction and was comparable with that of glibenclamide. The vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) of the active butanol fraction demonstrated both hyperglycaemic (BMBuF2, -19% and BMBuF3, -24%) and hypoglycaemic (BMBuF7, 62%; BMBuF8, 41% and BMBuF9, 56%) activities at the dose of 1 g/kg orally at the 4th hour in different subfractions. VLC fractionation of BMBuF7 gave BMBuF7C, (66%); BMBuF7D, (26%) and BMBuF7E, (22%) as the hypoglycaemic fractions monitored at the 4th hour when tested at the dose of 750mg/kg in alloxan diabetic rats. The methanolics extract stimulated the secretion of insulin in the INS-1 cell culture and this activity was concentrated in the butanolic fraction. The ethylacetate and aqueous fractions however inhibited insulin secretion. In conclusion, this study concluded that the extracts of B. monandra contain hypoglycaemic constituents and thus justified the ethno-medical use of the plant in the management of diabetes.|Theses Collection|Antidiabetic/ethno-medical/Bauhinia monandra Kurz/alloxan/glucometer/ethylacetate/n-butanol/chromatographic methods/in vitro insulin secretory cell (INS-1) culture/ hyperglycaemic*||||||Oyelade, Olanrewaju Jelili|M|Application of fuzzy logic in modelling of students'performance||||||M.Sc.

A fuzzy-based modelling system was developed and the performance parameters such as very low(below 39%), low(40%-49%), medium(50%-59%), high(60%-69%) and very high(70% and above) of the model were specified. A computer based simulation programme to implement the fuzzy-based modelling system was developed. A Performance analysis of the various results generated was carried out.The results showed that the overall performance from 1995 to 2002 in the two Private Schools for the fuzzified model ranged between 54.04% and 59.67% for School A and 59.72% and 62.04% for School B respectively. Using the deterministic model the same data gave results ranging between 50.08% and 55.72% for School A and 58.58% and 61.93% for School B respectively. These results represented a medium level performance for School A and closer to high level performance for School B in both models. In the two Public Schools, the fuzzified model ranged between 47.11% and 49.67% for School C and 46.11% and 49.50% for School D respectively, while the deterministic model for these schools ranged between 46.05% and 49.38% for School C and 44.34% and 47.85% for School D respectively. These represented a low level performance in both Schools for the two models. The same prediction could also be made for the next eight-year period. From the error analysis, the average error of the fuzzified model (3.50%) was consistently less than that of the deterministic model (4.00%) as against the theoretical error-free state in this kind of system.In conclusion, the computer based fuzzy model was more realistic in arriving at more practical ways of accurate assessment of students' performance as against the manual deterministic system which was time consuming and difficult to handle. The model was also capable of assisting the educational planners to make an effective decision to identify areas of weakness of the students and make appropriate amendment for better performance in future.|Theses Collection|Fuzzy Concepts/students' performance/educational planners/deterministic model*||||||Adeyemi, Aderemi Yakeen|M|An evaluation of financial management and performance of construction contractors in Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Construction Management|I.J.

Questionnaires were used to generate data from the same sample of contractors on their resource management practices and the degree to which some environmental factors affected their financial performance. The business factors were rated on the Likert-type scale to form the environmental constraints called A-model. All the 19 ratios generated from their financial reports were included in four variances of stepwise multiple regression analysis to formulate the financial performance index (FPI) model while 10 of the ratios were used to formulate the effectiveness of working capital (EWC) model using linear discriminant analysis.The result of the analysis showed that the resources management practices of the contractors deviated in many uses from the acceptable standard in practice. The severest organizational and environmental constraints to the contractors' performance were materials theft on site and delayed payment to contractors respectively. The profitability, based on profit on turnover (POT) of the contractors was 2.9% compared to 2.5% and 3.5% found in the U.K. and U.S.A. respectively. The FPI-model classified 60% of the contractors as having high financial performance (FP1>1) and 40% as having low financial performance (FPI<1).The EWC-model correctly classified 87.7% of the contractors into groups that managed their working capital effectively and those that did not. There were high correlation coefficients of -0.66 between the A-scores and FPl-scores; -0.638 between the A-ores and EWC-scores and +0.772 between the FPI-scores and EWC-scores.In conclusion, it is established in this study that contractors with a high financial performance were those that had less business constraints and effective working capital management while contractors with a low financial performance were those at had more business constraints and ineffective working capital management. It is of evident in this study that the FPI-scores, the EWC-scores and the A-scores are appropriate complimentary models for separating the group of contractors with high financial performance from the group with low financial performance in the Nigerian construction industry|Theses Collection|Financial management/resources allocation/working capital/financial reports/Likert-type scale/turnover/Nigerian construction industry *||||||Saheed, Sefiu Adekilekun|M|Vegetative anatomy of some species of Cassia L.

Emend Gaertner, Senna Miller and Chamaecrista Moench (Fabaceae) in South-Western Nigeria were carried out so as to establish some identification pattern for these genera and their species.Quantitative and qualitative observations were noted for habit, leaflets, stipules, floral and fruits. Anatomical observations were recorded microscopically for petioles, leaflet laminas and stem. Morphological characters which reveal their generic distinctions include; Habit, leaflet apex and base, presence or absence of foliaceous stipules, degree of hairiness in sepals, petals shape types of inflorescence, fruit shape with length, the number of leaflets pairs, the length and width of leaflets and the number of lateral nerves in the leaflets. The attributes for the delimitation of species are mainly quantitative.Anatomical attributes that are useful in generic separation include: the shapes and number of vascular bundles in transverse section of the petiole, the presence or absence and types of stomata and venation pattern. Features useful in species identification includes: guard cell area, stomata index and frequency, presence or absence of trichomes, types as well as their length on epidermal surfaces and wall types.In conclusion, this study revealed that combinations of morphological and anatomical features can be used in the taxonomic delimitation of the three genera.

The specific objectives of the study were to investigate the productivity bonus in the bank to examine the attitudes of Wema Bank workers towards the current productivity bonus in the bank; and to evaluate the impact of productivity bonus on workers' performance in the bank.The data for the study were collected from fifteen branches of Wema Bank Plc. These branches were selected from the Ibadan, Oyo state, Osogbo, Ile-Ife, Edunabon, Modakeke and Ifetedo in Osun state. On the whole, I50 respondents were included in the sample survey. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The qualitative data collected through interview were presented using simple percentages. The quantitative data collected through questionnaire were processed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The first level of data analysis involved the use of frequency distribution. The second level of data analysis was done using cross-tabulation, and the measures of the independent variable against indices of the dependent variable: logistic regression analysis and simple percentages were used in testing the hypotheses and this helped to determine the level of correlations among the selected variables.The study did not find any significant relationship between productivity bonus and workers performance in Wema Bank Plc. Rather, the findings showed that there was a significant relationship between job security and workers' performance in Wema Bank Plc. Workers showed positive attitude to productivity bonus, they said productivity bonus increased their performance because the productivity bonus were 800 per cent of their basic salary. It was also discovered that the issue of job security appeared more important to workers in Wema Bank Plc than earning any bonus on productivity 46 per cent support job security while 4.8 per cent support productivity bonus. This could be as a result of unemployment problem in the country.One major conclusion from the study was that productivity bonus was not the sole determinant of workers' performance; rather some exogenous factors such as the nature of the economy, and unstable political climate were found to influence workers' performance even more significantly than endogenous variables such as promotion, job security, recognition/fame challenging work and good management style. Thus, the study concluded that productivity bonus on workers' performance depend not on extrinsic motivation alone but largely on the contingencies confronting an organization.|Theses Collection|Productivity/Wema Bank Plc/Incentives/workers' performance/Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)/bonus/promotion/job security*||||||Ekwubiri, Foster Chijioke|M|External debt and Nigerian foreign policy under the Buhari and Babangida administrations||||||M.Sc.

Prior to this period, the buoyant economy which was a fall-out of the oil boom of the 1970s made it unnecessary to seek external loan not to mention its having any significant implications for Nigerias foreign policy.  The work assumes that there was a linkage between the buoyant economy of the 1970s and significant roles played by Nigeria in West Africa, Africa and global politics. Based on this assumption, the study looks into the effects of the debt crisis on her foreign policy from 1984 to 1993 in the areas of formulation and implementation. In doing this it tries to determine whether the external debt has brought about specific changes in Nigerias foreign relations within the period under review. To accomplish these objectives, the study relied on primary and secondary data. Primary data include related government publications, official documents and interview with research fellows at the Central Bank of Nigeria and Nigerian Institute of International Affairs.  All these were supplemented with data collected from Secondary Sources.  In the final analysis, the study discovered that: Nigerias external indebtedness has not caused any fundamental change in the substance of her foreign policy. Nigeria' s external indebtedness has, infact, strengthened the old pro-western alignment while commitment to West African economic integration and security continued unabated. However, external debt has brought to the limelight the importance of economic aspects of Nigerias national interest. This is reflected in the adoption of economic diplomacy as a policy thrust. Various policy measures aimed at ameliorating the effects of the external debt on Nigeria' s economy have not had much significant impact because the government has continued to finance its internal development with external loans at a very high interest rate at a time that the fluctuation in the world's oil market has persisted|Theses Collection|Central Bank/debt crisis/external indebtedness, national interest, world's oil market*||||||Fasanmi, Oluremi.

This situation has led youths and manpower to be attracted, from the rural areas with little or no infrastructures to the already congested cities. The establishment of DFRRI by General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida's administration in 1986 was an attempt at redressing the problem of rural neglect. This study appraises the effectiveness of DFRRI in six of its rural development activities viz: the provision of rural feeder roads, rural water supply and sanitation, agricultural schemes, rural electrification, rural housing schemes as well as rural industrialization in some rural communities of Oluyole and Egbeda Local Governments of Oyo State. Primary data were collected through extensive fieldwork and by interviewing thirty- eight (38) public officials both from the state and the two Local Governments under study, while seventy beneficiaries were also interviewed. Secondary data were collected from DFRRI'S Headquarters, published studies on rural development in Nigeria in general and in Oyo State in particular. In addition, government publications on activities of DFRRI were consulted. Government Gazettes, State and Local Governments files, unpublished theses as well as newspaper cuttings were found quite useful. Analyses of data revealed that the Directorate had relative success in three activities, namely, the provision of rural feeder roads, rural water supply and sanitation, as well as rural electrification. The beneficiaries were not impressed at all by DFRRI's activities on the provision of rural housing schemes, rural industrialization and its agricultural improvement schemes. The findings include: DFRRI'S inability to mobilize rural population to support its activities as well as its failure to participate in the maintenance of its implemented projects in the rural communities, and in most cases the rural population was ignorant of its activities in the rural communities. It was also discovered that DFRRI'S activities were confronted with five major problems - viz_: shortage and mismanagement of funds, fraudulent practices among DFRRI'S officials, inadequate supervision and monitoring of DFRRI'S activities as well as fixing of uniform rates for execution of projects in each state without consideration for the peculiar nature of each community|Theses Collection|Socio-economic welfare/rural and urban development/Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida/DFRRI/Nigeria*||||||Aderibigbe, Olutoyin Tolulope|F|An economic analysis of rice processing and marketing in Osun  and Ogun States, Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Agric.

It provided information on rice grain qualities vis-a-vis consumer preferences with the aim of providing feedback to future programs of rice-breeders and processors. It examined the channels of rice marketing from harvesting to consumption and identified prevalent problems of rice marketing and processing, as they existed in the States of study. Primary data were collected through three types of structured questionnaire while secondary data were collected from relevant agricultural publications and statistical journals. Each type of questionnaire was for rice processors, wholesalers/retailers and consumers respectively. The frontier production function method was utilised to assess efficiencies among rice millers, while the Herfindahl index, the Kendal Tau's coefficient of concordance and multiple regression models were utilized to achieve other objectives of the research. Findings revealed that rice milling was seasonal among respondents due to the seasonal nature of paddy production and supply, a situation, which compelled them to engage in secondary occupations. There was however, considerable profit to rice milling activities ranging between two to three Naira per kg of rice milled. Technical efficiency levels observed among respondents in their rice milling operations were quite high and more than 40% of them achieved up to 100% of the average technical efficiency estimated with the frontier production function method for given levels of input while only 12% of them operated at less than 50% of the average estimates. High technical efficiency was also confirmed by the relatively low percentage of broken grains (mean 19.4% and mode 20%) in rice milled by respondents when compared with that for imported rice (ranging between 16%-18%). Allocative efficiency on the other hand, was generally low ranging between 1.16% to 38.43% with an average of 11.8%. Economic efficiency was consequently low (between 1.25% to 33.3%) with a mean value of 10.9% and almost half (48%) of the respondents operated their rice mills at below 11% economic efficiencies.Findings revealed further that rice importation into the country continued despite its ban because of the finishing qualities of imported rice which were preferrable to those of locally milled rice while differences in these finishing appearances were due largely to different parboiling and drying techniques. |Theses Collection|Rice/rice milling activities/South-Western Nigeria/rice-breeders*||||||Arua, Arua Eke|M|The use of the stylistic device of free indirect style in selected African novels written in English||||||Ph.D. English|C.

The three texts studied were read in turn and passages containing examples of Free Indirect Style in each text were identified.  They were then classified and analyzed under different sub-headings' such as "Frequencies and nature of occurrence of Free Indirect Style", "Variety of examples of Free Indirect Style", and so on according to the type of linguistic marker the example manifest. The study found that examples of Represented Speech and Thought and Represented Perception, which, for the purpose of this study, form the two aspects of Free Indirect Style, occur frequently in the selected texts. It was that Represented Speech and Thought examples containing linguistic features such as rhetorical questions, initial conjunctions, modal auxiliaries, deictic elements and certain lexical selections which include evaluative adjectives and attitudinal nouns assume great prominence, and are indeed crucial for the interpretation of the texts.  Free Indirect Style contributed to the success of the selected texts in that it has proved to be very useful in four ways. One, the various examples isolated, help to highlight the authors concerns in the three texts. Two, the notion of point of view was shown to be more complex than is generally supposed. Three, the style is used to distinguish between the major and minor characters in the novels of Achebe and Armah and to show how the authors have developed the characters in all the texts.

This was done by carefully basing the study on the works of M A. K. Halliday and Chris Kennedy. The works of these two scholars then serve as searchlights for the major concern of the thesis. Sentences manifesting the transitivity system in   English were identified from The beautiful ones are not yet born, listed analysed and discussed in order to find out how they have been used in the novel to delineate character and develop the major themes of the novel. More specifically, the sentences relating to the person and behaviour of characters such as: Koomson, Estella his wife, Amankwa, the timber merchant, the bus conductor and the man were discussed in some detail in order to find out how those characters have been developed in the text. It was found that the sentences manifesting the transitivity system in English were used in The Beautiful Ones Are Not Yet Born to satirize Koomson, his wife Estella, Amankwa and the bus conductor. The sentences were also used to develop the character of the man and to some extent to satirize him. It was also noted that such sentences were very many in the novel.  The factor showed that linguistic stylistics is quite suitable for the study of literary texts written in English by African writers|Theses Collection|African literary texts/transitivity system/African writers*||||||Asiyanbola, Akinola Akintunde|M|Some problems associated with the verbal group in texts written by senior secondary school learners of  English in Ife Central Local Government Council Area, Osun State, Nigeria||||||M.A. English|B.

In addition, the study attempted an explanation of the learning problems using some language learning theories such as Error Analysis (E.A.), Interlanguage (I.L.) and Contrastive Analysis (C.A.). The methodology employed was the error analysis of the written target language production of the randomly selected final year (SS III) students in four secondary schools. The occurrences of the verbal group errors in the essays written by the subjects were identified and accounted for using per- centile representations and a bar chart. Equally, learners' errors in the area of the English verbal group were categorised and explained through the use of the Contrastive Analysis of Lado (1957), the Interlanguage hypothesis of Selinker (1972) and Error Analysis of Richards (1989).It was in the light of the above that the study found out that the subjects' written compositions reflected errors of   confusion in the use of verbal group forms such as those of the past, present, progressive, perfective, passive, dynamic and stative forms. The subjects also had errors of omission, redundancy and confusion in the use of the primary and the modal auxiliaries. Other verbal group errors identified were those of the subject-verb concord, mis-spelling, overgeneralization of tense and concord rules, and confusion in the use of the separable and the non-separable verbs. In conclusion, the study was able to make some suggestions on the teaching of various verbal group forms such as those involving the simple present tense, the simple past tense, progressive and perfective aspects, negative, interrogative and passive transformations, primary and modal auxiliaries in the English as a Second Language classroom, most especially in Nigerian secondary schools|Theses Collection|Learning problems/language learning theories/Lado/Selinker/error analysis of Richards/verbal group*||||||Essiet, Unanaowo Jimmy|M|The teaching of discourse to learners of English as a second language in Secondary Schools in Osun State||||||M.A. English|S.A.

The thesis explored strategies for the teaching of transactions, highlighted the strategies available for turn-taking and proposed techniques for the teaching of exchanges. The study also highlighted the lexical and structural devices recognisable for topic development as well as the strategies that could be used for repairs. The methodology used involved the collection of data from two broad genres of spoken discourse namely classroom interaction between teachers and students and casual conversation between various categories of people. The data was also used to exemplify the five features of discourse management and organisation that are of concern to us in this study. These are transactions, exchanges, topics, turn taking and repairs. The data was also used to elucidate the strategies suggested for the teaching of these discourse features. The study concluded by advising that the teacher of discourse should not always lay emphasis on structural competence to the detriment of communicative competence. The study also recommended that other areas of discourse such as the roles of cohesion and coherence as well of that of intonation in interactive discourse could also be explored by other researchers interested in discourse studies|Theses Collection|Lexical and structural devices/classroom interaction/casual conversation/discourse management and features/intonation*||||||Adeyemi, Babatunde|M|ECOMOG and peacekeeping in Liberia||||||M.

A Yoruba Master musician is capable of sustaining his performance for several hours without running out of creative ideas. How does he do it? From where does he derive the creative materials? Can everybody in the community do the same? Answers to all these research questions formed the main thrust of the thesis. The methodology employed is in three fold; bibliographic review, interview survey and analysis. References were made to the existing literature on African music. In addition, interviews were conducted with some selected notable Rara and Iremaje Musicians in Ibadan, Oyo, Ogbomoso and Ifewara. Comparative method was used to analyse the creative techniques of the musicians interviewed. The thesis found, that the Sources from where the musicians derive their creative materials lean very heavily on oral poetic genres, folk tales, festival occasions, religious settings, slangs, praise poetry, social norms, taboos to mention just a few. The thesis further revealed that the forms of the musical types that are performed by the musicians are part and parcel of the music heritage of the community.

The study is purely on his compositions. However, the biography of the musician is discussed to reflect the influence his personal life and environment have on his creative process. His Music were classified into periods to reflect the degree of his musical growth. Few information on Nigerian Popular Music especially the history and the development's of the genre are discussed as a background for the study. Primary data were collected mainly from interviews with the Musician, his instrumentalist and his fans. Also from live recordings and participation in some of his performance. The Secondary data were collected from journals, magazines, newspapers, archives, libraries, textbooks, encyclopedia and recorded music of Muddy. The laboratory work is on the translation of Muddy's Composition (because it is unannotated compositions) and the analysis, which resulted in the specific findings on his compositional techniques. These research findings showed that Muddy's technique of composing text and music simultaneously makes his melody tonal. His device of matching melodies enriched his harmonic progression. The tonal realizations on the percussion and multirhythmic patterns produced exhibited his rhythmic Mastery. The use of the bass guitar as a percussive instrument gave his music a remarkable accompaniment. His skilful choice of poetic framework adds to the aesthetics of his lyrics. Finally, all his techniques are geared towards audience participation. This study concludes that this is a contribution towards evolving the theory of Nigerian popular Music composition process. Muddy Ibes music is a case study for further investigation into highlife Music style. The study enhanced the understanding of the highlife as a Nigerian popular genre |Theses Collection|Nigerian popular music/percussion instrument/multirhythmical patterns/highlife music*||||||Ademowo, Ephraim Adebola|M|The growth of the Apostolic Church in Ijesaland||||||M.A. Religious Studies|A.O.

It examined the theological similarities and difference between the Apostolic Church and Mission-related Church on the one hand, and the indigenous Aladura churches on the other. In addition, the thesis evaluated the religious and sociological impact of the Apostolic Church in Ijesaland from 1930 to 1990. The methodology employed combined the historical-critical and theological perspectives. These consisted of an objective description of the available historical and sociological data followed by hermeneutical interpretation and evaluation. The meaning of the data from the point of view of the members was considered, followed by theological evaluation. As part of this methodology, participant - observation approach was also used. The thesis discovered that the key figure in the history of the Apostolic Church in Ijesaland was Pastor John Aluko Babatope, a former Catechist in the Anglican Church in Ilesa. The thesis also revealed, among other things, that the Apostolic Church believes in miracles or healing and openly preaches it. The thesis found that the church has contributed immensely to the socio-cultural developments of the Ijesa people. Like the other AIadura Churches, The Apostolic Church has significantly affected the spiritual life of the older 'orthodox' churches within the culture-area |Theses Collection|Origin of Apostolic church in Ijeshaland/indigenous Aladura churches/theological similarities/religious and sociological impact *||||||Adeyanju, Oluwafunmilade Joel|M|Effects of Audio taped instruction and cued visual on acquisition of cognitive imagery skills among Junior secondary school Art students in Ile  Ife||||||Ph.D Educational Technology|D.K.

A total of 360 junior secondary school Form Two students were subjects for the study. They were randomly selected and assigned to one of the nine experimental and control groups. There were three main experimental conditions made up of the audio taped song and poem, the visual instructional materials, and the audio taped and visual instructional combined condition. Under each experimental condition, some subjects received the enriched treatment once, some received it twice, while the other subjects received particular treatment four times. The control groups did not receive any treatment. The pre-test scores on drawing and comprehension exercises for every subject were collected. The subjects in the experimental groups were taught with specific enrichment treatments which were audio taped, cued visual instruction and combined audio taped and cued visual instruction. The post-test scores for all subjects on drawing and comprehension tests were thereafter collected. A series of planned comparisons and two-way Analysis of co-variance were used to analyze the date collected. The results showed significant main effects of the treatment conditions, and gender. Subjects in the experimental group performed significantly better than subject in the control group both in the drawing and comprehension tests. Subjects who received the combined treatment performed significantly better than those who received each treatment separately. In essence, the mean score (x) of the experimental groups for the results showed significant main effects of the treatment conditions, and gender.

It examined the extent to which Nigerian athletes have actually used ergogenic and psychoactive drugs. The study examined the behavioural dispositions of athletes who used drugs and those who did not use within sports setting. A total of 220 athletes were randomly sarnpled from eleven popular sports in Nigeria. Questionnaire was used to collect relevant data for the study.  The data collected were analyzed using appropriate statistical technique Chi-square (X2), t-test and Analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results showed that there was a significant influence of psychological factors on drug use habits among the athletes. Athletes in team sports scored the psychological reasons for drug use significantly higher than athletes in individual and dual sports. Such psychological factors as desire to excel, desire for material and monetary reward, nervousness, arousal elevation and the desire to experiment are important factors inducing athletes to use performance-enhancing drugs. Sociological and Psycho-physiological factors have no significant influence on drug use habits of the athletes. The number of male subjects who confessed they had used drugs before was significantly higher than the number of female   counterpart. However, male drug users were significantly higher than male non-users. Significant differences were found between drugs users and non-drug users with respect to age, type of sports, religious beliefs and training base of the athletes. It was found that the users of drugs recognised poor concentration, hand tremors, premature deaths and mental problems as some consequences of use of drugs to enhance sports performance|Theses Collection|Egogenic and psychoactive drugs/consequences of use of drugs*||||||Amole, Oludolapo Olutosin|F|An evaluation of students residential facilities in some Nigerian Universities||||||Ph.D. Architecture|Ralph Mills Tettey//Sola Olowu||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Architecture|1997|||OAU|||||xxi, 363p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The study was conducted in twenty selected halls of residences in some universities in southwestern Nigeria. Data were collected at two levels: at the level of the hall of residence and at the level of the respondents. At the level of the hall, data were collected about the physical and socio  physical characteristics of the halls of residence from architectural drawings.These data constituted the basis for the analysis and classification of the residences into five hall types. At the level of the respondents, the survey produced information about the users demographic characteristics and the cognitive and affective responses to their present facilities. Two thousand questionnaires were distributed in all the hall of residence using the stratified sampling method of which 1,124 usable questionnaires were returned. The data obtained were subsequently analysed by the use of frequencies, bi-variate contingency tables, multiple regression, factor analysis and discriminant analysis.The results showed that the problems of students residential facilities had both quantitative and qualitative dimensions. The qualities of the residences were perceived as poor and most of the respondents were quite dissatisfied with living in these residences. Two factors, which contributed most significantly to the negative responses expressed, were the high social densities experienced and the maintenance of the facilities. The aspects of the residences, which were favourable to the students, were those related to design and location. The students activity most affected by the low quality of the residences was the activity of studying. The users behavioural responses to the spaces in the halls were influenced by their preferences for other spaces and the availability and quality of the facilities provided also to make the spaces functional. The results also showed that there were significant differences in the responses towards the five types of halls of residences indicating that the 'type' is an important dimension along which post-occupancy evaluations ought to be conducted. These responses to the types were fairly consistent and indicated that the most important variables in the 'types' which influenced the evaluation of the quality of the halls were the form of access and services. These variables implicitly defined the size and hierarchy of the social units within the hall further supporting the strong relationship between architecture and social experience|Theses Collection|Students characteristics and the 'types' of facilities/southwestern Nigeria/hall of residences/architectural drawings*||||||Asaju, Adebakin Simeon|M|A study of the housing market in Ibadan, Oyo State of Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Estate Management|J.

This study represents an attempt to analyse the factors, which are responsible for these rental levels with particular reference to the rental housing market in lbadan, Oyo state of Nigeria. Specific objectives of study include:(i) To examine the socio-economic characteristics of rental households in residential districts of Ibadan. (ii) To analyze the rental price levels in the residential districts.(iii) To examine the relative importance of the factors? Affecting rental price levels in the residential districts. (iv)To compare and contrast the existing practices of rental housing management between landlords of, rental properties and formal property Management companies. (v) To make appropriate policy recommendations with a view to achieving a more functional, effective end efficient rental housing delivery system in Nigeria. In pursuance of the objectives of study, primary data were obtained from two main sources. Firstly, data on socio-economic characteristics of rental households were obtained from questionnaires administered on rental households in the residential districts in lbadan. Secondly, data on rental housing management information were obtained from another set of questionnaires administered on a sample of 50 Estate Surveyors and Valuers at their work places. The secondary sources of data included several published documents and records of established government corporations, agencies and ministries as well as the Central Bank of Nigeria. The data for the study was analysed with the aid of descriptive statistics with respect to data connected with the socio-economic characteristics of rental households and data on rental housing management. In addition, inferential statistics (correlation and multiple regression were used in analysing the factors influencing rental levels. The results were supplemented with some sketches of explanations such as the qualitative differentiation among the residential districts. With respect to the high-density residential district, the study showed (in terms of the validation of the original hypotheses) that rental levels have largely been positively influenced by income and cost of construction. In the medium density area, the only factors, which were found to have positive significant influence on rent, were average price index of building materials and lending rate. In the low-density area, income, average price index of building materials, lending rate and inflation rate were factors found to have positive significant influence on rental levels. Based on the findings of study, appropriate policy recommendation were offered with a view to achieving a more functional, effective and efficient rental housing delivery system in Nigeria. These include, inter-alia, facilitating land acquisition for housing development, mobilising adequate finance for housing development and reducing the cost of finance," developing local building material resources, reducing costs through cheap and functional design and development of effective and efficient rental housing Management and maintenance strategies|Theses Collection|Rental price level/socio-economic characteristics/rental housing management/ residential districts *||||||Okoror, Sylvester  Ikheloa|M|Mortgage - Financing mechanism as a strategy for the operation of staff housing loan scheme in Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile  Ife , Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

It provides security to the lender, to the borrower and to the whole world. In spite of its painful antecedents and foreclosure cases the mortgage system is regarded as the panacea for housing delivery in this urbanized economic world where there is a wide gap between personal income and shelter cost. Indeed it is now an index of a country's stage of economic development. Staff housing loan scheme operationalized as a mortgage loan enables the inclusion of welfare terms like low interest rates, long term of repayment, long moratorium, and further advances on second and subsequent mortgages to be incorporated in the mortgage instrument. Unfortunately the Obafemi Awolowo University Authority operates staff housing loan scheme as medium term personal loan with staff gratuity and third party guarantee. This denies the staff beneficiary and the University the advantages inherent in a mortgage finance system. Therefore, this thesis evaluates the OAU staff housing loan scheme vis -a-vis the mortgage financing option and suggest ways of adjusting the scheme to ensure greater effectiveness|Theses Collection|Housing finance/micro-level*||||||Akinola, Shittu Raimi|M|The impact of rural roads on physical development in Ife region, Osun State, Nigeria||||||Ph.D. Urban and Regional planning|S .O.

The specific objectives of the study include the examination of the level of accessibility of the respondents to rural facilities and the extent to which the provision of transport facilities, among other factors, has influenced the patronage of the limited rural facilities in the study area.The study examined the real access needs of the communities and of the individual households. Information was collected through interviews from the officials of the former three local government councils. Structured questionnaire was served on the village heads and a total of 457 household heads in the twenty four sampled rural settlements. The percentile method was used to analyse quantitative data. Regression was run on some of the variables. Locational accessibility of the selected settlements was calculated and personal accessibility of the respondents to rural facilities was measured. The result of analysis showed that about 28.0% of villages within the sampled communities are linked with footpaths indicating isolation and inaccessibility. Also, it was found that low accessibility (deficiency in transportation facilities) inhibits the productive potentials of rural people in Ife region. The cost of movement on rural roads is a disincentive to use the rural facilities; and the action space of the people is greater than the spatial features of all rural facilities (but more pronounced, in particular, for agricultural input facilities (58.0%) and health centres (38.0%) which are pressing needs of the people), thus, representing low welfare in the rural area of Ife region.The study also showed that rural roads have not generated the development of other rural infrastructures as expected in the region. This is due to the fact that most settlements are linked with bad roads and the opportunity costs of using these roads constitute a heavy drain on the resources of the users in terms of time, energy and money. For instance, the use of rural roads takes the time and money of rural dwellers at an average of 300% and 250% respectively when compared with their urban counter-parts.The challenge of rural accessibility planning is to make more facilities (especially, agricultural input facilities and health centres) available within the bound of action space of people in the rural area and open up the isolated villages. In order to demonstrate elements of commitment to the welfare of the people, there is need to evolve an appropriate policy for rural road development. An important strategy in this wise is the need to establish labour-based rural road development programme where the effort of government will be complemented by that of the local people|Theses Collection|Level of accessibility/rural facilities/transport facilities/rural areas*||||||Ademilua, Lawerence Oladimeji|M|A geoelectric/geologic evaluation of the groundwater potentials of the basement complex area of Ekiti and Ondo state, South Western, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

This is with a view to identifying the geo-electric/ hydro geologic characteristics of the area. Two hundred and sixty nine (269) vertical electrical sounding (VES) data was interpreted qualitatively and quantitatively. Overburden coefficients of anisotropy were calculated for all the YES points. Maps were prepared from lineament, geo-electrically identified fractures, borehole yield and overburden coefficient of anisotropy. Qualitative analysis of the 269 YES curves shows that the H- type curve, the KH-type, HKH, HA, A and the KHKH-type curves predominate the study area. Four subsurface geologic layers were identified in the study area. These include the, topsoil, the weathered layer, the partly weathered/fractured layer and the bedrock. Five aquifer combinations were delineated. These include the weathered aquifer; the weathered/partly weathered or fractured (unconfined) aquifer; the weathered / fractured (confined) aquifer; the weathered/fractured (unconfined)/fractured (confined) aquifer and the fractured (confined) aquifer. The characteristic YES type curves are H; HA; HKH; HAKH and KH respectively. The mean groundwater yield is minimum for weathered aquifer and maximum for weathered/fractured (unconfined)/fractured (confined) aquifer.   The lineament map shows that the western flank of the study area has high lineament frequencies while the northern, eastern and southeastern parts have, characteristically low lineament frequencies. The geo-electrically identified fracture frequency map also shows that the western central and southern parts have high fracture frequencies while the northern/north western and eastern part has low fracture frequencies. The borehole yield and coefficient of anisotropy maps reveal that the central, western and southwestern parts have high groundwater yield and anisotropy coefficients while the northern eastern and southeastern parts have characteristically low groundwater yield and anisotropy coefficients. The borehole records show that the mean overburden thickness is lower, in areas underlain by igneous rocks than metamorphic rocks. High lineament frequency, high fracture frequency and high anisotropy coefficient are characteristics of high groundwater potential zones. Based on these geologic and geo-electric characteristics, the study area was classified into high, medium and low groundwater potential zones |Theses Collection|Hydro geologic characteristics/subsurface geologic layers/aquifer combinations/ borehole/ high, medium and low groundwater potential zones *||||||Ojo, Adebayo Olufemi|M|Studies on biozonation and paleoecology of the Neogene Foraminifera of Central Niger - Delta Basin||||||Ph.D Applied Geology|M.

A total of 989 ditch cutting samples were obtained and analysed at intervals of 3.0m from eight exploratory wells in five oil mining leases (O.M.L), OML 58, 59, 63,86, and 90. 189 species of foraminifera were identified from the studied sections. The biozonation of foraminifera was aided by using a computer software programme of ranking and scaling (RASC), which resulted in the identification of four major biozonies within two temporal epochs, these are:  (i) Quinqueloculina seminulum/Ammonia beccarii zone: Late Pliocene.   (ii) Haplophragmoides bradyi/Cyclammina cancellata zone: Late Miocene. (iii) Lenticulina cultrata zone: Middle Miocene, and(iv)	Textularia laminata/Bulimina pupoides zone: Early Miocene The paleoecological interpretation of the foraminiferal events were based on UPGMA cluster analysis, which classified the samples (Q-mode) and the species (R-mode) into four major groups: For the Q-mode analysis of the samples, the four groups identified are: Group 1A- representing samples that characterize the deltaic environments. Group 1B - are samples characterizing, the lagoonal/semi-restricted (i.e. shallow, near shore sublittoral) environments, Group 2A, are marine samples while group 2B are characteristic of the marginal marine environments. The R-mode analysis of the taxa, are grouped into four classes also. Group A is dominated by, the Bolivinids; group B, comprises of the arenaceous foraminifera as the dominant taxa, but a few calcerous ones are also found. Group C, is a cluster of Uvigerinids and Group D contains a lot of the Miliolids and some other calcareous benthonic foraminifera.   The results of the Q and R modes were interpreted, to give a better insight into inherent structure of the data, thus aiding interpretation and evaluation of data. Correspondence analysis, an ordination method was employed to detect the relationship of the samples and species in a continum. The result showed that the environment of deposition ranged from a deltaic one through the marginal marine to an outer neuritic zone. The sedimentological approach was employed to compliment the paleoenvironmental analysis based on paleontology. The results detained showed that the informal Unit A, representing the continental deposits are devoid of foraminifera, but are found to contain in abundance, broken shells of micro gastropods, pelecypods, ostra- cods and abundant lignitic materials. The informal Upper Unit B is made of alternation of sand and shale, which contains pyritized faunal remains, thus suggesting a reducing environment in quiet water. The Lower Unit B is a shaly unit that is dominated by benthonic foraminifera and some oolitic materials, suggesting that sedimentation rates probably fluctuated during deposition, The faunal and sedimentological evidences showed that the environment of deposition varied from a shallow marginal marine environment, (where warm water temperature prevailed in some parts and the amount of dissolved oxygen varied from very low to high in different parts of the basin) to outer neritic zone, Recovered and identified foraminifera were illustrated using the scanning electron microscope |Theses Collection|Zoning, distribution and the illustration of forarninifera/oil mining leases/species of foraminifera*||||||Adebile, Emmanuel Adewumi|M|Prediction of temperature rise in tumours and surrounding normal tissues during microwave heating||||||Ph.D Mathematics|R.

The work is particularly interested in establishing criteria for effective heating, conditions for safety and selection of heating devices in the control (regression) and possible cure of tumours. A model of the physical problem leads to a set of equation; criteria for existence and uniqueness of solution were given. These equations were solved under physically reasonable assumptions. The possibility of hot spot has lead to seeking criteria and condition to prevent overheating or destruction of normal tissues in the attempt to destroy diseased cells. Four categories of the model were considered under various assumptions. Each category of the model was investigated by considering constant and variable thermal conductivity, constant and variable perfusion and convective parameters; homogenous and heterogeneous tissue volume, single and multi-layered tissue. Whole body and localized heating were also considered. For each model realistic boundary condition were prescribed with a selected microwave-heating device. The Laplace transform technique, the series method and asymptotic techniques to get inner and outer solutions; were the method used to solve the problems. Appropriate matching conditions were introduced at the interfaces. Upper bound for temperature rise for constant thermo physical properties for some heating devices was obtained.The effect of the thermo physical properties, the boundary conditions and the heating devices were discussed.

The objective was partly to investigate the diurnal and seasonal variation of the radiation fluxes over a tropical station and to estimate the solar energy potential at Ile-lfe. The variations were investigated with reference to the harmattan season, normally characterised by a high loading of dust particles in the lower atmosphere in the West African sub-region, and the rainy season, which is characterised by, enhanced cloudiness and high content of atmospheric water vapour. Measurements of hourly global and diffuse solar radiation and downward flux of long wave radiation have been made using Kipp and Zonen pyranometers and Eppley Precision infra-red Radiometer, for an inclusive period of 3 years (Feb 1992-Dec 1994) at Ile-lfe (7.5°N4.57°E) Hourly, daily and monthly totals of the radiation fluxes averaged over the 3- year period of data have been computed. Fourier series expressions for estimating both the daily global and diffuse solar radiation and their respective standard deviations have been obtained for Ile-lfe. The empirical coefficients of the model equations obtained and fitted to the actual data traced the annual trend of the measured daily radiation data fairly well. The data set has also been compared with the 10- and 30-day moving averages.

The data consisted mainly of monthly and annual rainfall data collected from 1906 to 1993, daily rainfall data from 1915 to 1993, and daily rainfall charts from 1970 to 1991. The charts were analysed for the amount, duration, intensity and timing of each rainfall event. Frequency analysis and measures of central tendency were employed to describe the amount, duration, intensity and timing patterns of rainfall. The main seasonal components were evaluated using mean cumulative percentage rainfall values. Measures of central tendency and dispersion were employed to describe rainfall variability, while rainfall reliability was directly assessed, using simple probability analysis. Rainfall trends and the interrelationships between some rainfall attributes were determined using the least square method, while rainfall periodicities were determined using power spectral analysis. The results obtained show that, rainfall in Ondo town is mostly convective in origin, short in duration, high in intensity and characterised by high degrees of variability. The most variable are the individual rainstorms and daily rainfall, followed by the various seasonal components. The annual rainfall total is less variable and therefore, the most reliable. Rainfall becomes much more reliable from the 23rd day of May up to the 19th day of October. The true rainfall onset and retreat are March and October respectively. Rainfall distribution during the course of a year is bimodal, with the primary peak coming up in the month of September and secondary peak coming up during the month of July. The August rainfall decline comes up between 2nd and 27th day of August. There is little or no apparent evidence of rainfall trends in the rainfall series, except for the rainfall series of the peak month. Trends detected are weak and statistically insignificant. Rainfall in Ondo town exhibits significant periodicities of between 2 and 8 years. This relates closely with the ocean-atmosphere interaction mechanisms. The acquisition of knowledge on the above parameters of rainfall in on do will further enhance the understanding of the nature of rainfall in southwestern Nigeria, and thus contributes to the formulation of consistent policy of rational planning, development and management of water resources. It is therefore necessary that, the study of the various atmospheric mechanisms engendering the various rainfall characteristics be considered essential research themes in the study of tropical climatology|Theses Collection|Nigerian meteorological services/rainfall data in Ondo town/various atmospheric mechanism/tropical climatology*||||||Johnson, Jolaolu Olubusayo|M|A study of gas chromatographic correlation of crude oils||||||M.Sc.

The analytical capability of this technique has been employed in this study to obtain chromatographic fingerprints of oils from several reservoirs units in Okan, Inda, Idama and Robertkiri fields. The correlation of these fingerprints using polar plots of selected peak ratios, bar diagrams of n-alkanes and isoprenoid (Pristane and Phytane) molecular ratios, cluster analysis to generate dendrograms and carbon preference index (CPI), were used to identity existing reservoir continuity and wellbore communication problems.Okan H-04 and H-05 reservoirs were found to exhibit both lateral and vertical continuity. .In the case of Idama D-07; Inda B-04, C-05; Okan K-O2, N-O1, 0-05, 0-07 and Robertkiri E-1A, reservoir continuity was mainly in the lateral  direction. There was however no evidence of either lateral or vertical continuity in Okan G-Ol, J-03 and Idama C-01 reservoirs. Significantly also, comunicating wellbores were identified among Okan H-o4 and H-05, Okan )-03 and K-03 reservoirs, potentially leading to commingled production.

Leaf samples were obtained from the Teaching and Research Farm, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria.  Crude protein and enzymes were extracted using appropriate extraction buffers, and homogenates centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4oC for 15 minutes. Polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis was used to determine the electrophoretic patterns in 12 plantain clones which were analysed for leaf protein, isozymes of   peroxidase,  tetrazolium  oxidase and  malate dehydrogenase. The result from leaf protein, tetrazolium oxidase and peroxidase studies indicated that the 12 clones which had hitherto been grouped into four (namely, French plantain, False horn, cooking bananas, and diploid AB) using morphological traits, could be separated    into 12 different cultigens. However, peroxidase and malate dehydrogenase isozymes could be used to group the clones into the existing genomic groups (Musa AAB, ABB and Musa AB). The leaf protein and tetrazolium oxidase isozymes were more polymorphic, and therefore amenable to separating clones, while peroxidase and malate dehydrogenase isozyme were least polymorphic indicating less potentiality in separating clones, but important as genomic biochemical markers.The potential of the use of similarity index in studying variations in banding patterns was also demonstrated. For example, similarity index of 75% and 85.7% for leaf protein was observed for French plantains and False horn plantains respectively.  The two exotic clones (TA-3 and TA-14) used in the study showed least similarity indices (17-38.46%; 9.09-30% for leaf protein, and tetrazolium oxidase respectively) with the local clones. The ploidy level had no effect on the total number of bands.|Theses Collection|Crude protein and enzymes/leaf protein/genomic groups/Leaf samples/isozymes*||||||Awokojo, Philip Idowu|M|The Effect of Transactional Analysis in the Treatment of Truancy Among Secondary School Adolescents in Ayedarade Local Government, Oyo State. ||||||M.

The factors considered to be influential on the treatment are sex, age and whether pupils parents are literate.Subjects used for the study consisted of fifty truants who were randomly selected from seventy-six initially identified truants in the schools.  The subjects were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups of twenty-five in each group. The instrument Attitude Towards Truancy Inventory (ATTI) designed by the researcher, was administered to both groups as pre-test.  The experimental group was exposed to the treatment and Attitude Towards Truancy Inventory readministered to the experimental and the control groups.  Data obtained from the pre-test and post-test administrations were subjected to the t-test and analysis of variance.  All hypotheses were tested at 0.05 level of significance.The results obtained showed that transactional analysis had significant effect in the treatment of truancy among secondary school students.  It was also found to be equally effective when used in treating both sexes, All the subjects of different age groups were found to have experienced no significantly different levels of changes in their attitude to truancy. In the same vein, no significantly different change was observed amongst pupils from parents of different educational backgrounds.

The study also sought to find out which (if any) of the methods is likely to be more effective. In order to achieve these objectives, four hypotheses were proposed for investigation.The sample for the study consisted of 77 subjects selected by stratified random sampling from two secondary schools in Ondo town.  Two questionnaires  Students Attitude Questionnaire (SAQ) and the Teacher's Unstructured Interview Guide were used to collect data.  Both were developed by the author and validated using KR-21 Formula and the Supervisors approval.Two groups, an experimental and a control groups consisting of 49 and 28 students respectively completed the SAQ both before and after the study. The experimental group was exposed to bibliotherapy and lecture methods while the control group received a placebo.  The content of the treatments reflect sex education concerns.  The treatment which consisted of four sessions, lasted four weeks.  Data collected by the end of treatment were analysed using T-test, U-test, and Z-test of proportion.The analysis revealed that the subjects in the experimental group had a more favourable attitude to teenage pregnancy than those in the control group as a result of the intervention of sex education programmes (bibliotherapy and lecture method). However, the two intervention programmes were found to be equally effective.

Specifically, the study investigated the effects of gender on the response of subjects to group career guidance and the effects of the academic ability of the students on their response to group career guidance.  The study further found out whether there were significant differences in the amenability of various components of career maturity, that is, career planning, career exploration and career information processing skills to group career guidance.The subjects used for this study consists of sixty Senior Secondary School (one) students of Seventh-Day Adventist Grammar School, Ile-Ife chosen by purposive sampling.  They were assigned in equal proportion to experimental and control groups. The research design employed in this study follows a pretest post-test control group design.  An adapted version of Super and Forrests Career Maturity Inventory was used in determining the vocational maturity scores of subjects.  The group career guidance sessions used in this study were modelled after Johnsons group career guidance plan.  The treatment entails nine group sessions of an hour spread over five weeks.The results of the analysis showed that the vocational maturity of students could be enhanced by exposure to group career guidance.  It was discovered that gender and academic ability have no effect on the response of students to career guidance.  It was further found that the various components of vocational maturity, that is, career planning, career exploration and career information processing skills elicited different magnitude of response from the students.  The response to career planning differs from that of information processing.  This means students might make plans about future careers without exploring or processing relevant information in their environment.

It was also observed that the estate surveying firms were more involved in plant and machinery valuations than the engineering firms.The study suggested, amongst others, that DRC approach should always be subject to test of adequate profitability and, in addition, that the possibility of higher alternative use values be considered, especially, for surplus or redundant plant and machinery assets.

Specific objectives of the study included an examination of the case with which land has been made available to developers, volume of property development before and after the Decree and mitigation of disputes over land transactions attributable to it.The study used three sets of open-ended questionnaires to elicit information from the Office of the Land Use and Allocation Committee, Bendel Development and Property Authority and a random sample of property developers.  Interviews were also held with key officials of the Directorate of  Land and Surveys, Benin city.The study revealed that the previous methods of sourcing land for development were relatively easier and more favoured by the people of Bendel State.  At the comparative level, it was found that deeds of conveyance and lease contributed higher percentage shares than that of the Decree.  Within the period under consideration, it was found that the State under  the State land law and its public agency, Bendel Development and Property Authority demonstrated inconsistently low percentage rates in land transactions before the promulgation of the Decree.On approval of certificate of occupancy, the  study revealed a positive relationship  between the  number of meetings held in each month and year by the Land Use and Allocation Committee.   This revelation brought into sharper focus the objective functions and need for regular meetings by the Committee. Further, it was found that it has become increasingly difficult to obtain land for development partly due to the arduous procedure of applying for a certificate of occupancy and the exorbitant fees payable on land. While the planning mechanism has contributed positively, other factors such as grant of  consent by the Military Governor and inability to secure mortgage loans from financial institutions have slowed down the volume of property development.  Moreover, it was found that while the Decree may not be singularly responsible for the numerous land dispute, it has provoked many constitutional, academic and legal problems.  Based on these findings and the background of the  objectives of the study, it may be said that the Decree has not been able to fulfil the objectives of its promulgation and the achievement of the rational socio-economic objectives of property developers in Bendel State of Nigeria|Theses Collection|Property Development/property developers/*||||||Inyang, Uduak Ekwere|M|Biosystematic studies of some Nigerian solanum species||||||M.Sc.

This study was therefore designed to provide useful information on the classification and identification of ten widely distributed Solanum species belonging to sections oliganthes, Torva, Melongena, Brevantherum and Solanum. Morphological studies were carried out by assessing all the structural features of the leaves, stems, fruits and inflorescence.  Anatomical studies of the transverse sections of the petiole, leaf-blades, tangential and radial longitudinal sections of the stems were carried out by preparing the slides which were examined microscopically. The seed proteins were extracted with normal saline and were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.The anatomy of the transverse section of the petioles showed four distinct shapes which were flat, spherical convex and semi-concave.  The arrangements of vascular bundles were observed to be crescent, reniform, "V" and "U" arc-shaped. Simple non-glandular and ellipsoidal glandular hairs were widely distributed on both surfaces or in some cases on one of the surfaces of the leaves. Moreover, different types of stomata which include anisocytic, staurocytic, diacytic and paracytic were present on both surfaces.  Electrophoretic mobility of seed  proteins revealed different combinations of bands at various distances from the anode.Evidence from anatomy and electrophoretic studies supports the transfer of S.

Within each plot, the density girth at breast height, tree canopy presence/absence, crown area and height of all woody species and individuals encountered were measured.  Control line transects were laid in each plot and percentage herbaceous aerial and basal cover and litter cover were taken at every metre point along the line transect.  Within each plot, British standard rainguages were installed to measure gross rainfall, through fall and stem flow.  Soil pits were dug in each plot to describe the soil of the plots.  Soil samples were collected along the transect at the 0-5cm and 5-10cm depths, oven dried, ground and analysed for physical and chemical properties.  Within each 50 x 50m plot, a 25 x 4m erosion plot was constructed and another plot kept bare all the time.  The volume of the runoff collected from each erosion plot was measured and analysed in the laboratory for suspended sediment, dissolved sediment, pH and electrical conductivity. Soil monoliths were taken from each plot to study regeneration potential. Various relationships between vegetation, soil, runoff and sediment yield were established using Shannon-Wiener species diversity index, Sorensen index of similarity, analysis of variance and correlation analysis.Results showed that plots in younger fallows had fewer woody species and individuals than the older plot.  The sand fraction of the soil particle was significantly higher  (< 0.001) than clay and silt content within each plot. There was no significant difference in the soil properties among the different plots.  The bare plot produced the highest values of both runoff and sediment yield followed distantly by the forest plot while the young plots had the lowest runoff and sediment yield.  Some vegetation parameters such as trees above 7m high, stem flow, tree canopy, woody plant basal area, significantly correlated positively with the runoff and sediment yield and these parameters are more pronounced in the forest plot than young plots. Some of these parameters led to low production or absence of herbaceous ground vegetation.     The quantity and composition of seedlings observed in the soil monoliths taken from these plots was a reflection of the composition of the woody and herbaceous species in the field. It is concluded those vegetation parameters such as high percentage of herbaceous ground vegetation or vegetation parameters that will lead to high production of herbaceous vegetation may effectively control soil erosion.  In the management of soil erosion hazard consideration should be given to production of herbaceous ground vegetation rather than tree production or planting|Theses Collection|Basal cover/Herbaceous aerial/sand fraction/soil particle/Shannon-Wiener species diversity index/Sorensen index of similarity/*||||||Otusanya, Olutobi Olufunmilayo|F|Water and boron stress studies on the growth and nutritional constituents of some Nigerian leafy vegetables (Amaranthus species). ||||||Ph.D, Botany|A.

Dubius Mart Ex. Thell., A. Spinosus L. And A. Hypochondriacus l.) were subjected to varying water stress and supraoptimal boron stress treatments with the view of elucidating the effects of these stresses on their growth and on the level of nutrients such as protein, ascorbic acid, inorganic minerals (calcium and iron) and phytate.  The work was also aimed at finding out the nutritional status in relation to the age of the leaves and stems of the amaranth seedlings.Temporary water stress treatment of the amaranths seedlings was effected by wetting them on alternate days only, while supraoptimal boron stress was effected by wetting the seedlings with a nutrient solution containing ten times the boron concentration (0.33mg kg-1) present in the complete nutrient solution.  The latter solution was used for wetting the control seedlings.  Seven week old amaranth seedlings were subjected to total water withdrawal and supraoptmal boron plus total water withdrawal stresses by withdrawing wetting completely for six days.  Investigations on the various growth parameters and nutrients were carried out by standard analytical procedures.Temporary water stress and total water withdrawal stress reduced the water content of the amaranth seedlings significantly.  Supraoptimal boron stress did not have any effect on the water content of A. Cruentus and A. Dubius but did increase the water holding capacity of A. Spinosus and A. Hypochondriacus.  A similar increase in water retention capacity was evident in the supraoptimal boron plus total water withdrawal seedlings.  Temporary water stress did impair the growth of the amaranth seedlings while prolonged supraoptimal boron treatment enhanced the growth of these amaranths by increasing the shoot height, fresh weight and dry weight.Analyses of nutrient concentration in the control and stressed amaranth seedlings showed that protein, calcium, iron and phytate accumulations decreased with age while ascorbic acid accumulation increased with age of these seedlings.  The leaves were found to be significantly richer in protein and calcium than the stems, while the latter were richer in ascorbic acid concentration.Temporary water stress and total water withdrawal stress treatments were inhibitory to ascorbic acid synthesis, although with relative intensity on the four amaranths studied.  Ascorbic acid concentration was found to be highest in A. Hypochondriacus seedlings while it was lowest in A. Spinosus seedlings. All the amaranth species studies were rich in protein.  Temporary water stress treatment increased protein accumulation slightly, while total water withdrawal stress had this effect on A. Dubius and A. Spinosus seedlings only.  Temporary water stress also decreased calcium accumulation but supraoptimal boron stress had no effect on calcium accumulation.  Total water withdrawal stress initially had a stimulatory effect on calcium accumulation, but this effect was lost by the time stress was prolonged and the seedlings had wilted.  Similarly, temporary water stress and total water withdrawal stress increased the iron concentration of these amaranths.  Supraoptimal boron stress, however had no significant effect on iron accumulation.  The leaves of the total water withdrawal and supraoptimal boron plus total water withdrawal seedlings were higher in iron than the stems.  Trace amounts of phytate was detected in the leaves and stems. Both temporary water stress and prolonged total water withdrawal stress enhanced phytate accumulation especially in A.

These compounds are known to cause flatulence, inhibit digestive enzymes and chelate available minerals in the body respectively.  Their levels in legumes are generally not well known.  The present work focused on the optimization of the nutritive values of these legumes.Experiments were carried out to determine moisture, ash and protein by Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC method) total sugar by Anthrone method, oligosaccharides by paper chromatography, tannin by colorimetric method using Vanillin-Hydrochloric acid, phytate by Anion-Exchange method, total calcium, magnesium, iron and zinc by Spectrophotometer (AAS), available iron by colorimetric method and ionizable minerals by speciation method using AAS.Experiments showed the following ranges: moisture from 7.3 ± 0.01% to 12.0 ± 0.3% ash from 3.50 ± 0.01% to 5.95 ± 0.52% and 3.50 ± 0.01% to 5.87 ± 0.10% for both raw and cooked samples respectively, while protein ranged from 21.3 ± 0.0% to 33.3 ± 0.4% and 21.6 ± 0.1% to 34.8 ± 0.3% for both raw and cooked samples respectively. Total sugar ranged from 87.1 ± 0.4 mg/g to 167.4 ± 1.4 mg/g and 74.5 ± 0.2 mg/g to 131.71 ± 0.97 mg/g for both raw and cooked samples respectively. Oligosaccharides occurred at levels that can cause flatulence in both raw and cooked samples, although cooking reduced the oligosaccharides content of these legumes.  Tannin ranged from 0.93 ± 0.14 mg/g to 3.86 ± 0.02 mg/g and 0.20 ± 0.01 mg/g to 8.47 ± 0.24 mg/g for both raw and cooked samples respectively.  Decrease in tannin upon cooking ranged from 13% to 84% with the exception of Keresting's groundnut which increased by 120% on cooking. Phytate ranged from 0.46 ± 0.01 mg/g to 2.98 ± 0.13 mg/g and 0.38 ± 0.01 mg/g to 2.31 ± 0.14 mg/g for both raw and cooked samples respectively. Cooking also reduced phytate contents of all the samples.

The Manganese-to-Sulphur ratios, Mn/S, and micrographic results confirmed that the cast-irons under consideration were gray cast-irons   and mottled cast-iron with ratios of 2.85, 2.5 and 1.5 respectively.  The formation of manganese sulphide precipitates during annealing led to a reduction of elemental sulphur and hence an increase,     in graphitization of the gray cast irons. Despite the various heat treatments carried-out to modify the as-cast microstructures of the alloys, alloys fractured in a brittle manner.  The high phosphorus concentration which promoted the formation of phosphide eutectic and some casting defects all tend to worsen substantially the casting and mechanical properties of the cast-irons.The silicone rubber, normally used for art work has been adopted to reproduce the wax pattern for the engine block.  The reproduction was excellent and details on the original engine block was reproduced clearly in the wax pattern.  With this technique, several patterns could be reproduced identically with a single silicone rubber mould.  The addition of straws to the moulding clay was found to increase its thermal stability and collapsibility|Theses Collection|Solidification morphology/moulding properties/*||||||Akinnagbe, Timothy Ajayi|M|Comparative source rock study of Sapele-1, Oben-1, Benisede-1, Jones Creek-1 and Nembe Creek-1 wells, Niger Delta||||||M.Sc., Geology|J.

The samples were from the following wells: Oben-1 (13 samples), Sapele-1 (10), Jones  Creek-1 (12), Benisede-1 (7) and Nembe Creek-1 (15).  Standard organic geochemical methods were utilized.  These include: Total organic carbon (TOC) determination, bitumen extraction and fractionation, gas chromatographic analysis of n-alkanes and kerogen analysis by acid treatment, density separation and microscopy. TOC ranges from 0.86-2.87% in Oben-l; 1.52-5.03% in Sapele-l; 0.76-1.85% in Jones Creek-l; 0.68-1.72% in Benisede-1 and 0.74 - 1.38% in Nembe Creek-1 well . Total bitumen extract (SOM) and saturated hydrocarbon yields (SHC)   range respectively from 1736 - 3976ppm and 488-1842ppm in Oben-l; 1759-3298ppm and 304-1241ppm in Sapele-l; 1345-2487ppm and 469-954ppm in Jones Creek-l; 639- 3421ppm and 284-1287ppm in Benisede-l; 1107-2815ppm and 300 - 676ppm in Nembe Creek-1 well . These results show that the shales contain adequate concentrations of organic matter for source rocks.  Comparatively, Oben-1 and Sapele-1 shales have much higher yields and are rich in organic matter while Jones Creek-l, Benisede-1 and Nembe Creek-1 samples contain average to good concentrations.Organic petrography shows that on the average; amorphous, herbaceous, woody and coaly organic matter respectively constitute 55%, 25%, 16% and 4% of kerogens in oben-1 shales; 52%, 25%, 18% and 5% in Sapele-l; 53%, 26%, 18% and 3% in Jones Creek-l; 44%, 26%, 25% and 5% in Benisede-l; and 43%, 33%, 21% and 3% in Nembe Creek-1 shales.   These, along with bitumen geochemical ratios, indicate that Oben-l, Sapele-1 and Jones Creek-1 shales contain humic (type III) kerogens with appreciable admixture of type II kerogens.       They originate from terrestrial and mixed (transitional) environments. Benisede-1 and Nembe Creek-1 shales however, contain predominantly type III kerogens with minor amounts of type II.  This suggests that they originate mainly from terrestrial environment. Vitrinite reflectance values range from 0.43-0.60%, 0.40-0.63%, 0.40-0.50%, 0.37-0.46%   and 0.42-0.61% respectively in Oben-l, Sapele-l, Jones Creek-l, Benisede-1 and Nembe Creek-1 wells.  These and thermal alteration index values indicate that maturity commences at about 263'7m (8650ft) in Oben-1 well; 2981m (9780ft) in Sapele-1 well and 3237m (10620ft) in Nembe Creek-1 well. In Benisede-1 and Jones Creek-1 wells, the source rocks are immature in the studied horizons.  Generally, depth to mature zones appears to increase southwards in the Delta. Based on a qualitative evaluation, Oben-l, Sapele-1 and Jones Creek-1 source rocks have moderate to good potentials to generate commercial quantities of oil and gas while Benisede-1 and Nembe Creek-1 source rocks are mainly gas prone.  The observed variations in the source rock characteristics are attributable to the heterogenous nature of the organic matter and to variations in the depositional environments. |Theses Collection|Organic petrography/Organic Carbon/*||||||Dan-Hassan, Mohammed Ali|M|Combined Electromagnetic and Electrical Resistivity Survey for Groundwater Development in North-Central Part of Kaduna State||||||M.Sc., Geology|M.

This is with a view to establishing  the different subsurface geoelectric layers, the aquifer units and their characteristics, the  subsurface structures/tectonics and their influence on the general hydrogeological conditions in the area.The electromagnetic profiling (E.M.P.) data and the interpretation results of the vertical electrical soundings (VES) revealed that the conductivity values obtained from E.M.P. are more influenced by the conductivity/resistivity of the weathered zone than the overburden thickness. The clay content of the overburden is therefore the primary factor influencing the conductivity.From the quantitative interpretation of the sounding curves aided by lithological logs from the boreholes, four major geologic units were identified.  These include the top soil, the lateritic layer, the weathered/fractured zone and the fresh bedrock.  The weathered/fractured basement constitutes the main aquifer unit.The investigation of the relationship between the overburden coefficient of anisotropy (ë) and groundwater yield (Y) shows that, on a local scale, the latter generally increases linearly with the former.  The correlation coefficient varies from 0.75 to 0.98.  Metamorphic rocks are characterised by low values of anisotropy coefficient while igneous rocks have higher values.A study of aquifer hydrogeological characteristics revealed that there are two major types of aquifers in the study area. These are the aquifers associated with weathered basement and aquifers associated with joints and fractures, with the latter usually occurring below the former.  Aquifer hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity were calculated from VES results, and the hydraulic conductivity calculated agreed closely with that determined from pumping test data. The isopach map reveals the areas with thick overburden which correspond to basement depression zones while the zones with relatively thin overburden cover correspond to basement ridges.  The depth to the bedrock varies from 4.3 to 64m.  The basement depression zones are priority areas for possible groundwater development in the study area.                   The basement ridges aid groundwater recharge from surface precipitations as they  act as     diverging  zones for groundwater flow into the basement depression zones.From the results of this study, the surveyed area has been delineated into high and low groundwater potential zones for future planning and development|Theses Collection|Hydrogeological conditions/electromagnetic profiling/groundwater/*||||||Fasuyi, Akinyemi Stephen|M|Evaluation of hyrdocarbon potential of four offshore wells in the Niger Delta using borehole geophysical data.||||||M.Sc., Geology|B.

A number of thick sand beds were selected in each of the wells and labelled intervals. The four wells were then correlated after depth- matching.  From the analysis of the lithology and the fluid content, wells A, B, C, & D were found to have penetrated the Benin and Agbada Formations with B & C probably terminating at the top of Akata Formation.The mineralogy of the reservoir beds were found to contain essentially quartz, calcite and anhydrite. The petrophysical parameters (porosity and permeability) were calculated and the water saturation values computed for each of the intervals in each well.  Both primary and total porosities were calculated. Apart from some tight zones of extremely low porosity values, the primary porosity (from sonic log) range from 19.3% to 39.5% while the total porosity (from neutron and density logs) range from 17% to 35.3% across the wells.  The average total porosity for well A is 29% while for each of wells B, C and D, it is 25% with an average total porosity of 26% for the-study area.   Water saturation values range from 8% 'to 100% across the wells suggesting some water and hydrocarbon saturated zones.On the basis of porosity and water saturation computations and the saturation cut-off values, depth 2356-2365m in well A, depth intervals 2383 - 2397m, 2480.5 2489m, and 2995-3022m in well B, and depth intervals 2363-2372m and 2959-2980m in well C are hydrocarbon-bearing.   Well D seems to be essentially water saturated.   Absolute permeability estimated for the hydrocarbon-bearing zones range from 25 to greater than 5000md.Computations showed depth range 2384-2397m and 2997-3022m in well B and 2366-2372m and 2968-2980m in well C to contain movable oil (productive zones) while the hydrocarbon in well A is not movable.  The productive zones total 36m in well B and 18m in well C with porosity ranging from 20.4 to 27.9% with an average of 23.1%, water saturation values from 22 to 58% and absolute permeability range from 25 to 470md with an average of 142md. In well A, gas-oil contact was located at depth 2358m and also oil-water contact at 2365m.  In well B, there is oil-water contact at depths of 2397m and 3019m while gas-water contact occurs at depth of 2489m.In well C, oil-water contacts are located at depths of 2372m and 2980m. The analysis and interpretation of the suites of logs have shown well A to contain unmovable hydrocarbon, wells B and C to contain 36m and 18m of movable oil respectively and well D to be more or less water saturated.

It deals with the determination of the heat transfer when frictional heating is considered near laminar separation in the flow pattern obtained when buoyancy forces are disregarded and the properties of the fluid are independent of temperature gradient.  The flow under consideration is one that has large Reynolds number along an immersed solid surface around which boundary layer is formed, where the velocity rises rapidly from zero at the surface to its value in the mainstream and the temperature Tw at the surface rises to the temperature T0 in the mainstream.  The forced convection near laminar separation has been discussed by Akinrelere, but in this study his work on the thermal field has been extended to include frictional heating term in the energy equation. The behaviour of an incompressible boundary layer entails singularities at a point of separation. This singular behaviour has been established in the works of Howarth, Goldrtein, Stewardson, Curle, Terrill and Akinrelere. The governing equations for velocity and temperature fields are derived and series solutions are sought for the equations.  The solutions are analysed for various parameters. The findings show that whenever separation occurs, the boundary layer equation ceases to be valid in the neighbourhood of the separation.   The heat transfer does not vanish at and near separation point and is of the form  	Q = A(l + x¼ + âx½ + ...)which varies as ó  (ó  is Prandtl Number) at least for  the first four terms.  This is in line with the findings of Curle and Akinrelere. The most significant among the findings is that whereas frictional heating affects the temperature distribution, it does not affect the heat transfer in forced convection near laminar separation .|Theses Collection|Buoyancy forces/thermal field/*||||||Obiadika, Samuel Ikenna|M|Mathematical theory for the validity of steady state enzyme kinetics.  ||||||M.Sc|R.

The microbial loads of the various brands of wheat flour and bread prepared from them were determined and the microorganisms associated with them identified.  This was with a view to determining the presence of any microorganisms persisting or surviving from the flour stage through the baking process into the resulting bread and to highlighting any pathogenic organisms that may be present, which might be posing a hazard to public health. Samples of different brands of wheat flour were purchased locally, from markets in Ile-Ife, and at Bodija, Ibadan. The samples were transported at ambient temperature to the laboratory, and analysed immediately for microbial load and kinds of microorganism, contained. Portions from the samples were used to bake bread and these were similarly analysed. The remaining portions of the samples were stored. For three months at ambient temperature after which the microbial load and kinds of microorganisms were determined Again some of these were used in baking bread and then analysed for microbial load. Nine types of moulds, eleven types of bacteria, and two types of yeasts were isolated, both from flour and bread.  The moulds include Rhizonus stolonifer, Absidia corymbifera, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus sp, Penicillium citrinum, Penicillium expansum, Penicillium frequentans- Westing.The bacteria consisted of Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus sp, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus warneri, Neisseria sp, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus firmus, Clostridium tetani, Lactobacillus salivarius, Corynebacterium diphtheriae while the yeasts included Saccharomyces cerevisae and Zygosaccnaromyces bailli. Most of the microbial types were also isolated in the flour after the three months storage, although the bacterial counlt decreased, while the yeast count increased in the stored flour samples.Some microorganisms were found persisting in the bread samples.  These included four types of bacteria, two moulds and one yeast.  Except for the bacterial species which are spore formers, it is not known if the others actually survived the baking temperature or were introduced after the baking. The species of yeasts isolated are not usually known to be implicated in human diseases. on the other hand, most of the moulds are known to produce mycotoxins in food while most of the bacteria are known to be capable of causing food poisoning or infectious.  It will therefore be necessary for flour manufacturers, retailers in the markets, bread bakers and the public at large to take appropriate steps in the treatment and handling of flours and bread, in order to avert hazards to public health. |Theses Collection|Bacterial/cereals*||||||Ladepo, Olayinka Omowonuola.|F|Effects of the wastewater from international breweries limited (Ilesa) on the water quality of the receiving stream.|||||| M.Sc.

This practice is patently fraught with danger because of possible polluting effects the wastewater may exert on the aquatic biota and the ecological milieu.  The aims of this study are to determine the physico-chemical and microbiological qualities of the wastewater from International Breweries Limited, Ilesa, and to assess the effects of the wastewater on microbial population and some physico-chemical qualities of the receiving stream. The receiving stream is locally called Omi-Asoro. The brewery wastewater samples were collected in pre-disinfected kegs.  In addition, water samples of the upstream and downstream of the point of effluent discharge were also collected. The samples were collected at monthly intervals from September 1990 to August 199I.  Bacterial and fungal isolation and enumeration were done by serial dilution and pour-plate technique. Coliform estimation was carried out by most Probable Number technique.  Bacterial isolates were identified by morphological and biochemical characterization while fungal isolates were identified through cultural and Morphological properties. The physico-chemical parameters were determined by standard methods. The brewery wastewater had relatively high values of total bacterial, bacterial, coliform and fungal densities with mean values of 1.04 x 106/ml, 1.58 x 104/100ml and 3.05 x 102/ml respectively. The dissolved organic matter, biochemical oxygen demand and total solids contents of the brewery  wastewater were high with mean values of 142.5mg/l, 700mg/l and 848.3mg/l respectively.  The alkalinity had a mean value of 496.4mg/l while that of the dissolved oxygen concentration was 0.12mg/l.  The pH and temperature of the brewery wastewater sample analysed had mean values of 9.2 and 370C respectively. The concentrations of nitrate, phosphate, chloride, silicate, magnesium, potassium, sodium and calcium were within the acceptable standards of Nigerias Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA).There were differences in the mean values of some parameters examined in the water samples collected from about 100m upstream and 150m downstream of the point of effluent discharge.  Total bacterial, coliform and fungal densities changed from 3.59 x 103 to 1.34 x 106 cfu/ml, 3.58 x 102  to 2.74 x 104 MPN/100ml and 2.65 x 102 to 2.24 x 102 cfu/ml, respectively in the receiving stream after mixing with the effluent.  Similarly, the dissolved organic matter increased from 8.4 to 21mg/1 while the biochemical oxygen demand increased from 71.6 to 252.5mg/l. The total solids also increased from 113.1 to 459.5mg/1 while the alkalinity increased from 87.3 to 169mg/1.  In addition, the temperature increased from 26.2 to 27 while the pH and dissolved oxygen decreased from 26.8 to 6.6 and 1.1 to 0.13mg/1 respectively. Generally, the concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sodium and nitrate in the receiving stream were within the acceptable standards of World Health Organisation. bacteria isolated belonged to the genera Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, Aerobacter and Staphylococcus.

The eggs were obtained from faecal samples collected from primary school pupils in Ile-Ife.  For each soil type, five groups of twenty 25g samples each received 100, 500, 2500, 5000 and 10000 Ascaris eggs respectively from a stock suspension of the eggs in physiological saline.  The eggs were then recovered using the centrifugal salt floatation technique.  Extraction of the eggs from ten of the soil samples in each group and for each soil type was carried out using saturated sodium nitrate (NaNO3) solution, specific gravity 1.30, while extraction in the remaining ten was carried out using saturated zinc sulphate (ZnSO4) solution, specific gravity 1.16 as the floating media.From sandy soil, and with ZnSO4 solution, the percentage of eggs recovered with the extraction varied between a peak of 13.88% in group II samples to a minimum of 2.16% in group V compared to a peak of 25.04% in group II and a minimum of 4.80% in group IV using NaNO3 solution.  In loamy soil, the percentage of eggs recovered varied from the peak of 12.52% in group II samples to a minimum of 2.08% in group V when ZnSO4 solution is the floating medium compared to a peak of 24.32% in group II and a minimum of 2.41% in group V using NaNO3 solution.

Significant differences were observed in the number of eggs recovered from the different soil types.  Sandy soil yielded higher number of eggs than loamy and clayey soils (P < 0.001) and loamy soil yielded higher number of eggs than clayey soil (P < 0.05) (Sandy > Loamy > Clayey).Using saturated NaNO3 solution, the number of eggs recovered were also significantly higher than when ZnSO4 solution was used for each of the three soil types at different egg concentrations (P < 0.05).Significant differences were observed in the number of eggs recovered from soil samples containing different egg concentrations, More eggs were recovered from soils to which higher number of eggs were added, indicating that the quantity of eggs recovered depends on the concentration of eggs in the soil.  However, the percentage of eggs recovered appear to have an inverse relationship with egg concentration within the range of egg concentration used.The study indicates that the salt floatation technique is not capable of recovering all eggs from the soil and that the soil type, density of the floating medium and egg intensity in the soil are important factors affecting the number of eggs that can be recovered from soil with the technique.|Theses Collection|Helminth eggs/worms*||||||Onwudiegwu, Ifeoma Eugenia. |F|Location of business units in Ile-Ife.||||||Ph.D, Geography|Omolade Adejuyigbe.||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Geograghy|1993.|||OAU|||||xxv, 372p.|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The study was based on twelve selected business activities covering retail, services and manufacturing in the urban area of Ile-Ife.The data for the work were collected through structured questionnaires administered to proprietors of the 683 surveyed business units.  Time series analysis, logistic growth curves and the nearest neigbhour analysis were employed in the examination of the spatial structure and processes of business units in the study area.  Smeeds index, accessibility index, correlation and regression analyses were used to test the validity of the statement of proprietors as to the factors of choice of location of their business units with respect to accessibility, commercial orientation, adequate space, ability to pay rent, nearness to residence, security, nearness to similar activities and nearness to desired activities.The findings revealed that activities clustered in certain parts of the town.  None tended towards even distribution though three activities (industrial machines, electrical and electronic services and printing) were random in distribution.  The evolutionary trend of the business types revealed that both relocation of older business units and the establishments of new ones were going on at the time of the study. In both cases, there was the tendency to establish in areas already noted for such activities.  According to the proprietors, the factors taken into account in the relocation of business units were(i)	Accessibility to customers,(ii)	inadequate space and(iii)	 security problem.The analysis validated the following factors cited by proprietors as determining the location of their business units: accessibility, adequate space, commercial orientation, nearness to residence, security, nearness to desired establishment and nearness to similar establishments.  Rent per se was not given much consideration.  Consideration for rent was built in or tied to the space needed by the business units.The findings of the study are important for understanding the factors which led to the location of business units in Ile-Ife and perhaps in cities of similar sizes and hence to the present agglomeration of business units in some areas whilst only a few units were found in some other places.  It is advisable that locations of their business units should be taken into consideration and any other urban areas.|Theses Collection|Urban area/Commercial orientation*||||||Mgbe, Charles Etaba.  |M|Work alienatation and involvement of workers in some Nigerian industries.|||||| Ph.D, Sociology & Anthropology|Similolu A.

To pursue this objective the impacts of the diverse socio-technical dynamics of work in modern industry on the quality of actual work experience were examined.  The central thesis developed is that work alienation and involvement are related behavioural dimensions arising from the experience of work as depriving or satisfying the workers salient job needs leading to the development of, either, a sense of detachment or identification in work.  In theoretical terms, the study aimed at providing an integrative understanding of work alienation and involvement as bi-polar states of the same phenomena rather than representing them as distinct types of work behavioural phenomena.Data for the study was derived from a survey of the attitudes, work perceptions and experiences of a sample of Nigerian workers drawn from the production line of four manufacturing industries which differ in their technology of production. The stratified random sampling technique was used to select a sample of 100 workers each from the staff list of workers in the production department of these industries.  The sample therefore represents the different categories of workers and production activities. The primary instrument of data collection was the survey questionnaire containing sets of structured and unstructured questions. Other sources of data included official documents and publications relating to the historical and socioeconomic profile of the four firms.  The different statistical programs used to facilitate the interpretation of data were frequency distributions, grouped means, correlation coefficients and multi-regression statistics.  The results of the Survey revealed widespread feelings and relatively high degrees of experienced alienation among the workers studied in the four firms.  The findings also showed that the workers expressed low degrees of job satisfaction and levels of work involvement.  There were also strong indications that the experience  of  overall   alienation   and   its   dimensions    of powerlessness,   meaninglessness,    social-isolation    and    self-estrangement varied in intensity according to technological type and work process.The findings, to a large extent, indicated that, like technology, social and demographic characteristics of workers also contribute to variation in work experiences, attitudes and behaviour.  The results emphasised the importance of extrinsic considerations in determining job interests while financial rewards and incentives emerged as the most important motivational factors for the Nigerian industrial worker.|Theses Collection|Industrial work/Job Experience/ Job Statisfaction*||||||Alatise, Michael Olanrewaju.  |M|A study of Osun river basin hydro-salinity flow systems for optimum crop yield.||||||M.Sc., Agricultural Engineering|H.

The present study combined a crop yield model with the hydrologic and salinity flow systems of a river basin to predict the management effects in water use within the basin.  The combined model uses functions which relate seasonal evapotranspiration and soil solution salt concentration to crop yield. Data on streamflow for the water years 1982 through 1984 were obtained from Ogun-Osun River Basin Development Authority, Abeokuta; information on crops grown was obtained from the Oyo State Agricultural Development Programme, Saki, while salinity data were based on site measurements at the gauging stations.  These streamflow salinity and crop data were used to verify the mathematical relationships used in this study.  The crop data were based on a separate computer program called OPTIMIZ in order to get optimum crop areas to optimize crop yield.The parameter set of the hydrologic and salinity flow processes was first determined by calibration before the model was tested.  Then the calibration parameters became inputs into the crop yield model. The model was then used with relative confidence in subsequent management studies. Results obtained from the model show that ·	Optimality in crop yield was obtained by optimal allocation of crop areas using a linear programming package inputs into the model. ·	When crop areas were doubled in order to determine whether or not the available water supply could satisfy the crop water requirements, there was no appreciable reduction        in yield per hectare as the available water supply in the basin met the crop water needs.                       ·	If drought should occur, yield per hectare could be reduced to upward of 90 percent and ·	Increasing salt concentrations of the river and tributary inflows by ten times resulted in substantial crop yield reduction in the range between 7 and 72 percent. From analysis, it was found that the water use efficiencies of the crops grown in a particular sub-basin (Iwo sub-basin) were determined: sorghum has a water use efficiency of 0.56t./ha/cm, while that of cassava is 0.109t/ha/cm. Determination of water use efficiency (WUE), affords planners the way to estimate the number of hectares to be irrigated with a given water supply particularly when water is limited or expensive or both.|Theses Collection| Water resources/Water Management/Water Utilization*||||||Odekunle, Oluseyi Iyiola.       |M|An investigation of selected physical and mechanical characteristics of melon fruit (Cucumis melo Linn). |||||| M.Sc.|O.

The primary aim of this study therefore was to investigate some physical and mechanical characteristics of melon fruit that are relevant in the primary processing and handling of the fruit as related to design of fruit processing machines. The relevant physical characteristics considered were surface area, weight, density, volume and shape (sphericity and roundness.) In investigating the mechanical properties, samples were subjected to compression tests under quasi-static and impact loading conditions with the samples loaded in the longitudinal axis.  The effects of time after harvest, delay in harvest and loading rate on the characteristic were also studied. Samples were drawn from 3 different sources to afford some degree of generalisation from test results. Quasi-static tests were performed using 4.0 and 1.27mm/min cross-head speed while a pendulum impacting device was constructed for the impact tests.  The force-deformation curves obtained were analysed to determine some mechanical properties such as the breaking force, stiffness modulus and rupture strength (toughness).  Energy absorbed by the samples to rupture under impact was taken as the fruit strength. Large variations in fruit sizes were recorded.  Fruit mass density Large was found to be nearly constant with a mean of 960kg/m3 at harvest.  Sphericity and roundness indices for the melon fruits were quite high with a mean of 0.94 and 0.95 respectively. The force-deformation curves of melon fruit exhibit a slight non-linear behaviour at the on-set of loading. The curve is however generally linear for most of the load duration until the fruit fails. Statistical analysis showed that fruit strength was not significantly correlated with fruit shape and size.  Significant differences in fruit strength (toughness) were however observed for fruits subjected to the two loading rates. Strength was also observed to increase significantly between the 0 and 4th week after harvest.  A delay in harvest of 4 weeks did not show significant effects on fruit toughness. Results of the impact tests showed that impact strength was highly and positively correlated with size.   Fruit impact strength varied from 110.8Nm to 25.3Nm for fruit samples weighing between 370 and 2283g.  The drop height and hence velocity of impact was found to be of high significance for fruit failure.|Theses Collection|Melon/Fruit Processing*||||||Ogunbiyi, Marcus Olaniyi.     |M|Effects of tractor traffic on soil properties and the yield of cowpea (vigna unguiculata.

These operations such as carried out during the pre-planting, planting and harvesting periods of crops involve the traffic and use of heavy machinery on the soil.  This compacts the soils plough-layer and adversely alters its conditions required for a good plant development.  This soil compaction problem which is further increased by repeated passes of   these machinery on the soil must be checked if the beneficial effects of farm mechanisation are to be fully realised, An investigation was therefore carried out on the effects of tractor traffic compaction on soil properties and on the performance of cowpea, which is the most frequently consumed grain legume in Nigeria. The study was carried out at the University's teaching and research farm.  Four compaction levels comprising of 0, 4, 6 and 8 passes of a 20kN standard row-crop agricultural tractor were replicated four times in a Randomised Complete Block Design. Compaction of the  soil was achieved by driving the tractor on close parallel tracks which covered 100 percent of the area. Cowpea seeds (variety, 1T84-224-4) were planted at uniform depth and spacing on all the plots. Cultural operations were also carried out on the plots under the same conditions while harvesting was done separately per plot on the same day and the weight of the dry grains determined per plot.  Soil samples were taken before and after compaction to determine  e required soil parameters.The results obtained showed an increase in bulk density by 6.3, 10 .7 and 26 .5 percent within the first 60mm of soil and 6.3, 7.4 and 10.7 percent within the next 60mm of soil were recorded respectively. The penetration resistance of the soil increased from 62kPa in its uncompacted state to 647, 1134 and 1754 kPa due to 4, 6 and 8 passes of the tractor respectively The porosity and void ratio of the soil were reduced with increases in the compaction level. the soil, The particle density and texture of the percent emergence of the seedlings and the rate of pod formation showed no significant relationship with the compaction level when tested at 95% confidence level.

Although, it is produced in large quantity, its consumption in Nigeria is still very low.  The high carbohydrate content of breadfruit makes it suitable for fermentation purposes.  This work, therefore, evaluates the potential of breadfruit for ethanol production.Ways of hydrolysing breadfruit were developed. These involved studies on the effect of different reaction temperature and initial starch concentration on acid hydrolysis of breadfruit flour.  Hydrolysis of breadfruit flour by the endogenous enzymes in green and dried sorghum malt, and its kinetics were investigated.  The effect of addition of Termamyl (a microbial enzyme) on the hydrolysis of breadfruit flour was also investigated.  Anaerobic fermentation of breadfruit hydrolyzate by Saccharomyces cerevisiae at pH of 4.7 and temperature of 300C, was carried out. During the fermentation studies, effect of nutrient source and supplementation on fermentation of the wort was investigated. Finally, economic feasibility of ethanol production from breadfruit was examined.Results obtained showed that increased reaction temperature favoured reducing sugar production during acid hydrolysis of breadfruit flour. The reducing sugar concentration decreased with increased initial starch concentration.  Maximum reducing sugar concentration was obtained after 60 minutes at 1210C.  The rate of hydrolysis increased rapidly in the early stage of reaction but was drastically reduced as the reaction progressed.  The reduction in the rate of hydrolysis could be attributed to product inhibition.The best mashing time profile of 20 minutes at 640C followed by 30 minutes at 720C was obtained for the hydrolysis of breadfruit flour with sorghum malt.  Hydrolysis of breadfruit flour with dried sorghum malt produced higher reducing sugar when compared with the green malt. Addition of Termamyl for the hydrolysis of breadfruit flour improved the reducing sugar concentration of the wort. Kinetic study of the enzyme hydrolysis revealed a non-adherence with simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics or Michaelis-Menten Kinetics with product inhibition.Supplementation of the breadfruit wort with inorganic source of nitrogen improved the ethanol yield du ammonium salt proved to be a better supplement when compared with urea. Ethanol production from breadfruit via plant enzyme hydrolysis appears to be economically viable.  A positive net present value was obtained after profitability analysis of the process.  With cassava as the starch source in the process, a positive net present value was also obtained. However, breadfruit based process has higher net present value when compared with cassava based process.  This is due to higher market price of cassava.. Production of ethanol from breadfruit via acid hydrolysis is not economically viable as the process gave a negative net present value, indicating a deficit upon investment in the process.|Theses Collection|Fruit Processing/Saccharomyces cerevisiae *||||||Okuhon, Emmanuel Etunim.      |M|Separation of ethanol-water mixture by locally prepared adsorptive media. ||||||M.Sc., Chemical Engineering|A.

On large scale production, the water in 95%(w/w) alcohol is removed by either of two methods: (Dehydration by distillation with a third Component or dehydration, by counter current extraction also with a third component.  On a small scale,  anhydrous ethanol can be obtained by the use of a suitable adsorbent in an adsorption process. The essence of this work therefore is to develop a method by which anhydrous ethanol can be obtained on a small scale by the process of adsorption, using available local materials. Different particle sizes of activated carbon were made from palm kernel shell (P.K.S.) and sawdust.  The sawdust was chemically activated, employing ammonium chloride as catalyst while the P.K.S. was steam activated after first being carbonized.  Starch was obtained from cassava and bread-fruit and used as adsorbent in its powdered form. Experiments were carried out to establish the adsorption capacity for each initial adsorbate concentration investigated.  Adsorption capacities were then established for the entire adsorbate concentration to obtain the adsorption isotherm. In this way, the adsorption isotherms for all the materials and particle sizes investigated were obtained. Refractive index and density measurements were used in measuring the change in concentration due to adsorption. Unique isotherms were obtained for the three different classes of adsorbents used.  The isotherms clearly show that while the chemically activated sawdust can be used to obtain anhydrous ethanol, the steam activated palm kernel shells and starch are not good enough as adsorbents for the production of anhydrous The results also show that while anhydrous ethanol can be obtained from an initial ethanol concentration of 3%(v/v) with the chemically activated powdered carbon, the smallest particle size range briquette (1.18 - 2.057mm) achieved the same result with an initial ethanol concentration of 91%(v/v).   The next particle size range briquette (2.057 - 2.812mm) swas still able to give the same result with an initial ethanol concentration of 92%(v/v). These results show that selectivity was enhanced by briquetting.

Although, efforts had been made to relate the hydraulic and hydrodynamic characteristic of the systems to the distillation performance, there is sparse data in the literature to relate the variation of such system variables (which have direct effect on mixing characteristics of the system), to the efficiency of distillation packed column.  This work, therefore, investigates the effects of system variables on the performance of distillation packed column.Viscosities and densities of three binary and a ternary systems have been measured at 30oC, 40oC, 50oC and 60oC covering the concentration range of 0 to I mole fraction of the most volatile component in the system.  The systems examined were Ethanol-Propan-2-ol Ethanol-Butan~1-01, Propan-2-ol-Butan-1-ol and Ethanol-Methanol-Water. Distillation efficiency of a pilot plant sized packed column was determined using these systems.  The concentration profiles across the packed section were measured by sampling both the vapour and liquid, at five positions within the bed section.  The profile was compared with plugflow and backmixing models. McAllister's three-body interaction model was tested with the experimental viscosity data, while Yen-Woods and Multifluid models were used to test the experimental density data.The McAllister's model gave encouraging results. Andrade type equation was satisfactorily obeyed by the viscosity of the mixtures.  Entropies and enthalpies of activation for the systems were found to be independent of temperature except the ternary system. multifluid model fitted the experimental density data better than Yen-Woods model.Binary distillation efficiency was found to depend on composite parameters which include, bulk liquid viscosity, density as well as feed composition and average column temperature.  These parameters influence the diffusional properties, marangoni and buoyancy effects which in turn affected the packed column efficiency.  Binary distillation performance decreases with increasing bulk liquid phase density while the viscosity effect is dualised.  The distillation efficiency decreases in the direction of decreasing average column temperature.  For situation of increasing bulk liquid viscosity with increasing average column temperature, the binary distillation performance increases.  Ternary  distillation  performance showed significant diffusional interaction between the transporting species in the system studied.  Insignificant difference was noted between the two non-interacting models employed. Stagewise backflow concentration profile model reproduced the experimental profile significantly. The backmixing is relatively low in the column with average eddy diffusion coefficient of 10-3 m2 s-l for the liquid phase.  This was found to increase with increasing backmixing coefficient.  The effect of molar vapour velocity on the degree of backmixing is significant.|Theses Collection|McAllister's model/ *||||||Olanrewaju, Iyabo Olayemi|F|A study of the rheological properties of soybeans fortified maize pap.     ||||||M.Sc.|C.

However, information on the rheological characteristics of Ogi which could be of immense value in process design is limited.  Therefore, an investigation into the rheological parameters of Ogi is studied. Ogi was prepared from maize flour or maize flour fortified with soybean fractions (soy milk, defatted soyflour, full fat soyflour and soy residue).  The shear rate-shear stress data for Ogi porridge were obtained using Haake Viscometer Model RV3 at shear rate, 0-18 s-1.  The effects of concentration (8% and 16%), temperature (70oC, 80oC, 90oC) and processing methods (wet milling/dry milling) on the flow behaviour index, consistency coefficient, and apparent viscosity were investigated.  The amylograph pasting characteristics of the Ogi samples were determined on the Brabender Amylograph at 8% conc. (dry basis) and at three different speeds (60, 70 and 80 rpm). Consistency values at 8% conc. (dry basis) and 70oC were obtained on Adams consistometer equipment.The Ogi pap were non-Newtonian pseudoplastic in nature. The concentration, temperature and method of processing were found to have pronounced effect on the rheological behaviour of Ogi pap.  The peak viscosities for the Ogi porridge were found to be significantly higher at 70 rpm than at 60 and 80 rpm speeds.  Also better stability for the product were observed at low speed than at high speed but high gelling tendencies were recorded at high speed.  The Adam consistency values followed the same pattern with amylograph peak viscosities although, the correlation coefficient was low (r = 0.47, p = 0.05).

The monitoring will facilitate proper maintenance and alsoenhance their efficiency and the safety of personnel.  However, most power transformers have only simple oil temperature gauge and silicon gel to indicate temperature and ingress of moistinto their coils, respectively.  These indicators are sometimes unreliable and inadequate and may lead to failure and breakdown of power equipment.  This work presents techniques for constant monitoring of a power transformers oil temperature and oil level, phase voltage and loading conditions.A temperature. transducer is employed in a bridge configuration to sense the oil temperature and then the circuit is subsequently modified to also sense the oil level.  Voltage and current transformers are employed to monitor the phase voltage and loading conditions respectively of the power transformer. An automatically triggered audio and digital display alarm are designed and constructed to eliminate the inherent subjectivity in human recordings of analog signals.  The device is constructed and tested with the variables simulated for a 500 KVA, 3-phase, 11/0.415KV, 50HZ oil-cooled transformer.Results from simulation show that the alarms trigger when one or more of the following conditions occur: oil temperature exceeding 80oC, oil level falling slightly below a predetermined level, the phase voltage falling by more than +10% of nominal rating or an overload or unbalanced load of up to 0.04 p.u. current.

Thermal cycling has been found effective as a method of grain refinement and compared to the more conventional techniques is simpler and cheaper.  However, the transformation behaviours and the beneficial effect resulting from this treatment are dissimilar in different systems and conditions.  The objective of this work was to investigate a locally produced mild steel in a cold-worked state.Studies have been conducted on the grain refinement of ST 44-2 steel by cyclic re-austenitization and alternate thermal cycling treatments.  Cyclic re-austenitization consists of repeated heating to the austenite range, soaking for a short time at the peak temperature and then quenching in water while the process of  alternate thermal cycling consists of alternate cycling between the austenite range and two phase ( a + Y) range with intermediate quenching.  The effects of the ausstenitizing temperature; holding time at the peak temperature, number of thermal cycles and degree of prior cold-work on degree of grain refinement were investigated. The Tensile and Hardness properties after the different forms Thermal cycling treatments we-re determined. Optimum temperatures exist for grain refinement By thermal cycling treatments.  The optimum temperature decreases with increasing number of thermal cycles. Generally, for all the holding times investigated, grain size increased with increasing period of holding time at the peak temperature.  Less holding time is desirable, the higher the number of thermal cycles.  For a given favourable condition of temperature and time, grain size decreases with increasing number of thermal cycles tip to a certain number after which further cycling does not  provide any observable grain refinement.  Prior cold-work improves the grain refinement produced by thermal cycling treatments.  The higher the degree of prior cold-work, the  finer the grain size obtained and the fewer the number of cycles required for optimum result.Alternate thermal cycling produced slightly better grain refinement than the repeated austenitization but repeated austenitization treatment though accompanied by poor ductility gave higher strength. However, alternate thermal cycling treatment gave better combination of strength and ductility.This research work has successfully established the potential applications of rapid thermal cycling treatments for the strengthening of the locally produced mild steel, ST 44-2.  However, further additional studies may be required to fully define the crucial parameters foroptimum effects. |Theses Collection|Cyclic re-austenitization/Austenitization Treatment *
