The political situation prevailing in Abomey in the 1840s is considered in Chapter one as a background to the establishment, in 1841, of the Regis factory in the Old French fort of Whydah.  It is argued that external factors played a significant role in Ghezo’s accession to power and in the emergence of palm oil as Dahomey’s major export-product.	In Chapter two, the first decade (1841-1851) of Regis’ activities is examined.  Taking place within the context of an international anti-slave rade crusade, the establishment of the Regis factory in a fort formerly built for slave trade purpose, was to become a source of conflicts between London and Paris as illustrated by the 1851 blackade of Whydah.	Victor Regis’s commercial successes were largely due to his clever political manceuvres (Chapter three).  Thus, the 1851 Auguste Bouet mission to Abomey assured a dominant position to his firm in Dahomey, till the early 1860s.	But (Chapter four) the period 1860s  1880s was one of challenge to this dominant position.  The Challenge came from various quarters and above all from his former associates and agents.	A careful and overall assessment of Victor Regis’s activities in Dahomey between 1841 and 1892 is attempted in Chapter five in order to bring out his role in the French occupation of the country.	Some aspects of the socio-economic impact of the house of Regis on Dahomey are considered in Chapter six.  It is contended that its leading role in the development of palm oil trade contributed to making colonial and post-colonial Dahomey dependent on a single export-product.|Theses collection|*||||||Soetan, Subula Oladunni|F|Comparative Analytical and Bioavailability studies on three brands of dapsone tablets||||||M.Sc.Pharmaceutical Analysis|Wolde-Ab Yisak||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Pharmaceutical Analysis|1984|||OAU|||||iv,124p|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

All the three were found to comply with the specifications in official compendia.Tablet weight variation tests gave standard error for the three products to be less than 1% in all cases.The results of the assay showed that the content of Product A was 101.3 + 0.6 (titrimetry), 101.1 + 0.3 (spectrophotometry), 101.2 + 0.4 (H.P.L.C.); that of product B 99.9 + 0.6 (titrimetry), 100.1 + 0.5 (Spectrophotometry), 100.1 + 0.4 (H.P.L.C.) and that of Product C 104.1 + 0.6 (titrimetry) 104.6 + 0.2 (spectrophotometry) 104.1 + 0.5 (H.P.L.C.).  These values were within limit specified in official compendia (99.0  101.0% B.P.; 92.5  107.5% U.S.P).  The two unofficial methods (i.e. spectrophotometry and H.P.L.C.) compared favourably with the official titrimetric method of the compendia.In disintegration time testing, one of the products (A), failed the test while the other two passed.  The bioavailability was estimated by the in-vitro dissolution rate test.  It was found that the T50% for Products A, B and C were 8, 340 and 4 minutes respectively.  It is proposed that this wide variation in the dissolution rate tests may indicate in equivalence of the three products.|Theses collection|*||||||Shodipo, Bamidele Olatunji|M|Evaluation of the Nutrient Composition of Proprietary feeds and management techniques of some poultry farms located around Ile-Ife.||||||M.Sc.|E.B.

About 75% of the farms had no feedmills and thus purchase their feeds from the remaining 25% who had feedmills and also from other sources.  The main constraints identified in 65% of the farms were mainly production, management and marketing problems.  The results also show that the present state of poultry management techniques in the surveyed area is still below acceptable standard due to the fact that the majority of these farms are small scale, depend largely on the few large scale farms for the supply of majority of their poultry inputs; lack the basic knowledge involved in poultry management; and also not keep adequate farm records.	Feed samples were analysed for proximate constituents, sugar, starch, calcium phosphorus, gross energy and metabolizable energy.  Significant differences (P<0.05) were obtained only in the crude protein component of the chick’s mash and also in the either extract and calcium components of the grower’s mash, while the respective nutrient components of the layer’s broiler starter’s and finisher’s mashes were similar, regardless of their sources (P< 0.05).  The calorie: protein ratio, AME and TME values were found to be 149, 2990 Kcal/kg and 3420 Kcal/kg for chick’s mash; 153.9, 2630 Kcal/kg and 3060 Kcal/kg for grower’s mash; 176.3, 2820 Kcal/kg and 3250 Kcal/kg for layer’s mash; 142, 3110 Kcal/kg and 3540 Kcal/kg for broiler starter’s mash and 169, 3340 Kcal/kg and 3760 Kcal/kg for broiler finisher’s mash respectively.  Conversion factors for converting AME to TMEp and AMEb to TMEb were 1.24 and 1.15 respectively.Thus, the results show that locally compounded poultry rations are of acceptable quality and that the poultry birds within the area studied can meet their nutrient requirements from the proprietary feeds available.|Theses collection|*||||||Sanyaolu, Titus Olumuyiwa|M|Study Habits, attitudes and subject preference as chemistry achievement correlates among some secondary school students||||||M.A. Education|O.J.

It examines the extent to which students’ preferences in chemistry, study habits and attitude towards studying chemistry are related to students’ cognitive performances in chemistry.	Data were collected using a Chemistry Placement Test (CPT) to classify the students into high, average and low aptitude groups, a Questionnaire to study and a Subject Preference Grid to assess the extent of the student’s preference for chemistry.  Data for the achievement measure were obtained from official school records of the students.	The Pearson Product-moment correlation coefficient, t-test statistics and one way ANOVA were used to analyze the data and to tset the three null hypotheses generated for the study.  The level of significance for the acceptance or rejection of the hypotheses was set at 0.05.	The data reveal no significant difference between students’ preference and students’ aptitude for chemistry.  The hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the study habits of chemistry students among the three aptitude groups investigated was upheld.  In addition, the data also reveal a significant difference between the study attitude of the high aptitude and low aptitude chemistry students. However, there was no significant difference between the study attitude of the average aptitude students and that of any of the other two aptitude groups at both ends of the scale.	On the basis of the findings, it was recommended that parents should ensure distraction-free environment for the private study hours of their ward; also that the chemistry class teacher should acquaint himself more to the below-average chemistry students with a view to helping them improve their affective behaviour towards chemistry.|These collection|*||||||Owonipa, Andrew Dare|M|Evaluation of yield in ten tomato cultivars||||||M.Sc.|Tunde Fatunla||Ile Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Plant Science|1983|||OAU|||||x, 103|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Although cultivar 6/41 was the highest yielding, its mean yield was not significantly different from that of cultivar S15P11.Only fruit number showed significant positive phenotypic and genotypic correlation with yield.  Fruit number and mean fruit weight had both significant negative phenotypic and genotypic correlations with each other.  I concluded that environmental and genetic factors that favour fruit number also favour fruit yield while factors that favour fruit size limit fruit number.While creating alleys a week before harvest does not affect varietal ranking, it generates sufficient edge effect such that the plot with alleys had higher mean row yields than those without alleys.  Plots with alleys had higher coefficient of variability (CV) than plots without alleys.  However, the increase in CV due to alleys is small and may be neutralized by the advantage of easier harvesting resulting from the clear demarcation of plots.When tomato seedlings were supplied with adequate amounts of all nutrients except nitrogen and phosphorous, their growth was increased with increasing levels of the limiting element with the maximum at 50 ppm (of N or P) beyond which further increase in the levels of N or P depressed tomato plant growth.  The response of tomato seedlings to nitrogen and phosphorous was not evident until 25 days after planting.|These Collection|*||||||Adebayo, Julius Olabode|M|An Evaluation of the Marketing-mix of a packaging firm-the case of van leer containers (Nigeria) Limited||||||M.B.A.|J.E.

The study involves:-(a) An analysis of the method;(b) Examinations of the problems encountered;(c) Recommendation of possible solutions; and(d) Assessment of the method with a view to knowing its future prospects.The method used by this medicament manufacturing company in disposing her products is called "Personal Selling".  The method involves the use of Salesmen who form a link between the company and her customers.  The Salesmen carry the products to the customers and the ultimate consumers of the company's products with a view to selling them for cash.The whole exercise started with a general appraisal of the company's activities, the inter-relationship of the various department constituting the company and the contributions of such departments towards the achievement of the company's objectives.  The exercise was later on narrowed down to the Sales department.  The organisational structure of the department was reviewed.  The Sales activities of the department for the past five years were given a thorough analysis.  The animal sales based on each product were extracted from the company's records to aid the aforementioned analysis.  The various problems militating against the sales department efforts to record high productivity were also given and extensive study.  Recommendations as to how the problem can be solved with a view to increasing the productivity and efficiency of the Sales Department was done.This method called "Personal Selling" used by the company in disposing her products was also given an analysis.  A conclusion was reached that the company has a brilliant future and the productivity of the Sales Department would be enhanced if efforts are made to solve the various problems militating against their plans to record large output by applying the recommendations made.|Theses collections|*||||||Adeboyeku, Koledola|M|Studies on Ant-homoptera Interaction||||||M.

Names of the insects and their host plants, the plants parts affected and symptoms of damage are presented.  Morphological descriptions of the ants and homopterans general were made.Stictococcus sjostedti Cockereli and its tending ant pheidole spp were recorded as the most abundant on cacao and pigeon pea at the months of April, August and December, 1978. Udinia catori (Green) and its tending an Oecophylla longinoda Latereille were the most abundant on mango.A field study carried  out to determine if S. sjostedti would survive in absence of Camponotus acvapimensis Mayr on cocoa showed that the scales had a fall in their population after removal of the ants and comparison with the control trial using t-test revealed significant differences at 5% C.L.  A similar trend was observed in the experiment on Crematogaster sp. and Planococcoides njalensis Laing.  The rate of multiplication of Aphis craccivora Koch was higher when five and ten C. acvapimensis were introduced to their colonies on cowpea seedlings.  Alate and apterous aphid numbers recorded were compared with control using a t-test and significant differences at 5% C.L. were noticed.  Rate of emergence of alate individuals were slower in ant-attended aphid colonies.The rate of multiplication of A. craccivora in presence of one of its larval predators, Ischiodon aegyptium Wiedemann was compared with rate of same in presence of both predators and the ants and in presence of the ants alone.  Variance analysis showed significant differences in the aphid numbers at 1% and 5% C.L.  The highest mean of 163.2 was recorded on a seedling with only ants and the lowest mean of 74.22 was obtained on a seedling with the larvae only.  The highest mean when ants and the larvae were introduced together was 146.88.  This shows that the ants do exercise a disturbing effect on the feeding activity of the predator.In the laboratory studies, two, four and six Pheidole ants were introduced to gravid females Dysmicoccus brevipes (Cockerell).  The numbers f nymphs larviposited in the three trials were recorded and these were compared with the control using analysis of variance and it was found that there were significant differences at 1% and 5% C.L.  It could, thus, be inferred that presence of the ants enhanced the rate of larviposition of the mealybugs.|Theses collections|*||||||Adedoyin Samuel 'Kunle|M|The impact on profits of the price and non-price policies of a Government Corporation, Oyo State Property Development Corporation||||||M.B.A.|Weinrich||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Management & Accounting|1980|||OAU|||||vii, 87|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Relevant literature was reviewed to provide a backgound for studying the effects of management decisions on the corporation's performance.The study finds a clear indication that the corporation performed below standard in tems of the year to year turn-over.  Although the firm managed to break-even in the last few years, it has not earned maximum profits.  The low productivity of the labour force was found to e one of the reasons for the poor earnings.It is argued that prices of the firm's products are often too high to generate profit-making sales.  Discount allowances were found to be discriminatory, and excessive amounts of ash tied up in accounts receivable.  There is neither a centralized purchasing nor a purchasing officer; resulting in non-competitive buying, non-economic orders and low turn-over.The study found that there is much ministerial interference, and that some board members do not have sufficient business ability or background to be of much service to the firm.|Theses collections|*||||||Karimu, Lamidi Ande|M|Histological and histochemical studies on the islet cells of foetuses of diabetic pregnant rats||||||M.Sc.

Although the bulk of the people are now to be found in south-western Nigeria, impressive Yoruba communities are in the neighbouring republics of Benin and Togo.  This study is primarily concerned with the Ketu, Sabe and Idaisa sub-groups in the Republic of Benin.  The aim is to trace, with the aid of verbally transmitted historical source-materials, the pre-colonial socio-political developments of the three major sub-groups.The thesis concerns itself with examining the process of state-formation in western Yorubaland.  Starting with an appraisal of the traditions of dynastic links with Ile-Ife, it reinforces the now widely accepted thesis that there was an indeterminable pre-dynastic era during which the foundations of the various kingdoms were laid.  Furthermore, the thesis examines the claims of the western Yoruba sub-groups to the main stream of Yoruba cultural hero (Oduduwa) and concludes that the kingdoms of Ketu, Sabe and Idaisa were 'secondary' kingdoms having their immediate origins in the troubles that gripped the Oyo region in the sixteenth century when Oyo-Ile was evacuated and at least six Alaafin had to live in exile.The thesis identifies three major phases in the political development of each kingdom:  the period of lineage-settlements when political authority did not exceed that of a lineage-head; the period of fusion of many lineage-settlements into 'city-states' in which a single lineage-head was recognised as head on the basis of his being a descendent of the first settlers, onile; and finally the installation of dynastic groups of refugees fleeing from the menace of the Nupe and Ibaaba in the sixteenth century.  The arrival of these refugees led to the integration of many 'city-states' into the three kingdoms.But the task of political integration was not easy, and each dynastic group had to spend a lot of efforts to stabilize its ascendancy.  The process of internal consolidation and consititutional adaptations were barely completed when at the end of the eighteenth century the three kingdoms were drawn into conflicts with the Fon kingdom of Dahomey.  With the rapid decline of Oyo after c. 1789, western Yorubaland became a theatre of wars for the whole period before the imposition of European colonial rule in c. 1889.|Theses collections|*||||||Erhun, Wilson Oyekigho|M|A study of the callus cultures of Balanites Aegyptiaca Del .and Tribulus Terrestris Linn for steroidal sapogenins||||||Ph.

There have been many arguments against the idea.  The originators of these arguments are ethnologists, anthropologists and philosophers.  The contributions of ethnologists and anthropologists to the dispute confuse its philosophical basis and obscure what philosophy is about.  The various contributors to the debate have been classified as: "ethno-philosophers", "professional philosophers" and proponents of "philosophic sagacity".This work undertakes the analysis, to traditional thought.  it also rejects the methodologies and findings of "ethno-philosophers" and "professional philosophers" with reference to traditional thought systems as unphilosophical.  Instead of looking for philosophical elements in traditional thought from the perspectives of ethnology and anthropology, as done by "ethno-philosophers" and "professional philosophers", we would do better to start by doing the critical conceptual analysis of some traditional concepts.  We will, on this basis find them relevant to philosophical discourse and will there be better able to appreciate the philosophical or non-philosophical nature of traditional thought. Specifically, this work is an analysis of the Urhobo language concepts of ERIARIE and ESEGBUYOTA, and a comparison of them with the English language of KNOWLEDGE and BELIEF.   The work expands upon the philosophical discussion of traditional thought by redirecting it to topics of fundamental importance to, and to a method relevant to, philosophical investigation.|These collections|*||||||Adeboyeku, John Akintoye|M|The economics of diversification: The  case of Broiler and/or Layer enterprises in Oyo State of Nigeria.||||||M.

Two instruments  an achievement test and a Likert-type attitude scales were used to investigate the effect of the NSSSP on the achievement and attitude of two groups (experimental and control) each containing 150 randomly selected students.  See appendixes I an II.	Analysis of the achievement data showed a significant result (*p <.05, t = .19) at .05 level of significance showing that the NSSSP was superior to the conventional programme.  There was no significant difference in mean attitude score.	Although, analysis of data showed a superior performance by the NSSSP treatment group over the conventional group, it was felt that variables other than those considered in this study could be responsible.  Such variables include:1.	Lack of inbuilt motivation in the NSSSP as well as the conventional programme.2.	Lack of suitable and adequate materials and equipment for the proper implementation of both programmes.3.	Teachers’ attitude and professional competence in the interpretation of the philosophy of the NSSSP and that of the conventional programme.On the basis of the major findings and the need for continuous appraisal of the NSSSP and the conventional programme vis-à-vis their philosophies and objectives as they relate to the nations’ philosophy and policies on education, the following recommendations among others, were made:1.	Studies should be carried out to evaluate the multidimentional outcomes including both intended and un-intended learning outcomes.  Such measures will give a wider scope of the impact the NSSSP has on its users rather than the narrow conceptions of academic achievement from a single test score.2.	Studies should consider teachers’ attitude towards the NSSSP and also their professional know-how in the interpretation of the philosophy and objectives of the programme.  This hopefully will reveal areas of need and training requirements for the proper implementation of the NSSSP so that the desired objectives will be realized.3.	Studies should focus on evaluation of resource materials available in Schools in general and particularly those Schools operating the new programme.  Information from such studies should reveal areas of need so as to improve the attitude of students and motivate their interest towards enquiry learning which the new programme advocates.|Theses collections|*||||||Adeleye, Isaac Adeyemi|M|Extracellular Alpha Amylase Production by Microsoccus Varians||||||M.Sc.

The different geomorphological and landscape features were determined by studying black and white aerial photographs (scale of 1:10,000).  A base map of a scale of 1:10,000 was developed by use of topographical sheets at scale of 1:10,000.  Land forms like little hills, undulating areas, valleys, flat and break of slopes along the valleys traced from the air photographs were transferred to the topographical maps.Six traverses randomly chosen were cut across all possible landforms and parent materials already identified.  Sites were selected for augerings and for siting soil pits to study the soil profiles.  The various soil morphological characteristics at each site were described and samples were taken for laboratory analysis.  Soil and site descriptions were made following the FAO (1975) recommended procedures for field survey staff.  The soil morphological descriptions and laboratory analysis results were used to classify the soil.The soils of the area studied were classified according to the local systems of Smyth and Montgomery (1962) and Moss (1975); Soil Taxonomy (1975) and the FAO (1970) systems.  According to the Smyth and Montgomery (1962) classification, the soils found were the Iwo, Egbeda, Ibadan, Oba and Jago and according to the Moss (1957) classification, Alagba and Atan series.In the Soil Taxonomy (1975) classification the soils of Iwo, Egbeda, Ibadan, Oba, Alagba and Alagba-Iwo Complex series were classified as Oxic Paleustults while Jago and Atan classified as Psammentic Ustifluvents.In the FAO (1970) classification, soils of Iwo, Egbeda, Oba, Ibadan were classified into Orthic Acrisols; while soils of Jago and Atan were classified as Cambic Arenosols; Alagba and Alagba-Iwo complex were classified as Dystic Nitosols.Regression and correlation analysis were done on some chemical properties of the soil.The agricultural values of the soil series as regards the suitability for various crops were explained.|Theses collections|*||||||Adelu, Amos F.|M|Museum as a Community Education Resource: A study of Museums in Lagos, Oyo, Ondo and Bendel States of Nigeria.||||||M.A. Educ.

The total number of respondents was 306 covering the museum locations under study.The statistical analysis and information survey carried out revealed that:1.	Public awareness of the potentiality of the museum as an educational resource is increasing rapidly.2.	Attempts are being made by the Federal Government and the Museum Administration to make the educational function of the museum more effective.3.	At present, there is not much educational link and material exchange between schools and museums.4.	In effect, the museum is no doubt, a viable educational resource.Based on the finding of the study and the discussion on implications for their educational practice, the following recommendations are made:1.	There is need to establish a Museum Reference Centre where information on bibliographic and documentary materials of all aspects of museum operation such as organization, administration, management, programs, architecture, exhibits, training, conservation and registration could be obtained2.	The study should be extend to other parts of the country to confirm and, or refute some general statements made in the study, for example the idea expressed that the three types of museums that fall under the study could be found in any geographical area in Nigeria as found in south-western Nigeria.3.	Another study on the effect of the museum on the public should be undertaken to elicit what impact the museum has or what is being gained from museum visits.4.	The language of the predominant ethnic group of the museum location should be used to accompany English labels in order to cater for a larger number of the museum community.5.	There is the need to resume the mobile Museum activities to give fair opportunity to people living in rural and distant areas to museum locations.|Theses collections|*||||||Adelabu Modupe Adeola|F|Role conflict of selected secondary school principals in Oyo State of Nigeria||||||M Phil Educational Admin.|Adaralegbe||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Educational Admin|1981|||OAU|||||ix, 81|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

The result of the study showed that there was indeed a significant difference between their expectation of principals’ role and the principals’ role perception, (t = 2.50, 962df, significant at P= .05 level).Among the referent groups, a significant difference was found in the expectation held for the principals by teachers on the hand (t = 6.87, df = 901 significant at P = .05 level).  Conversely, similarities were discovered in the expectations of schools board members and students (t = 0.45, df = 77 not significant at P = .73) and those of teachers and schools board members (t = 2.33, df = 232, not significant at P = .23) and also in the perception of men and women principals (t = 0.37, df = 28 not significant at P = .72).One implication of the findings is that where there are differences noted between role perception and role expectation, the principal will likely experience role conflict which may be the subject of another study.  In the same way, where there are differences in role expectation of the referent groups, the principals may also experience role conflict.Suggestions for avoiding sources of role conflict as indicated in the study include stronger links between the principal and his referent groups, and principals’ re-examination of their leadership styles.|Theses collections|*||||||Adeboyeje, Reuben Adepoju|M|The Management of School  Physical facilities in Ondo State, Nigeria: A case study of Ikale and Ondo Local Government areas.||||||Ph.

The present investigator therefore established a model and used it to appraise the processes of providing, insuring, keeping, utilizing, maintaining and evaluating school physical facilities in Ikale and Ondo Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Ondo State of Nigeria.Relevant data were collected through the use of a questionnaire designated “School Physical Facilities Management Questionnaire” (SPFMQ) coupled with an interview guide.  In addition relevant documents were studied and prevailing management practices observed.  The respondents for the study were sixty-four chairmen of Parents-Teachers Associations; sixty-four chairmen of governing boards; two officials of the State Ministry of Education; and School personnel made up of sixty-four principals, sixty-four heads of departments, and sixty-four prefects.Data were analysed descriptively, using tables and percentages and matching prevailing school physical facilities management practices against expectations indicated in the model provided.The following findings emerged from the study:(1)	Out of the sixty-four schools, only 16 or 25% followed accepted guidelines in (a) the processes of providing physical facilities; (b) plant insurance; and (c) plant maintenance.(2)	None of the schools adopted the expected guidelines for (a) planning the use of physical plants; and (b) the evaluation of the management of physical facilities.(3)	All the schools followed accepted guidelines for property accounting.(4)	The constraints on the management of school physical facilities were categorized as political, economic and social.In the light of these findings, the investigator suggested that (1) the “team approach”, involving officials of the Ministry of Education, an educational consultants, a school architect, school personnel and community/PTA members, be adopted in managing school physical facilities; and (2) while encouraging schools to engage in fund-generating activities, government should also mobilize communities to raise funds in order to have more money for the provision of the required school physical facilities.|Theses collections|*||||||Odetola, Grace Yetunde|F|Micronutrient studies of soils of different lithological properties||||||M.

Consequently, Nigeria has a very few decades of cumulative development to its credit.(ii)	The government economic policies appear to have been biased toward the urban-industrial sector while the subsistence-agricultural sector has received insufficient attention, and(iii)	The operation of the Marketing Board system, which has been a crucial factor in the agricultural economy of the nation, has not been anything efficient.In an attempt to break the prevailing vicious cycle, this study has endeavored to examine the problems of the groundnut economy of northern Nigeria with a view to identifying the potentials and prospects of using the groundnut industry as a means of enhancing the income of the rural people in the four upper northern Nigerian states.  Within the framework of this goal, most of the relevant institutional arrangements relating to the groundnut cultivation and marketing, together with the various government policies and programs are analyzed.	Because the human agent is an important factor in economic development, some attention was devoted to the examination of the economic behaviour of the people in the groundnut region as revealed through history.  The idea is to infer from this what the attitude of the people is likely to be toward any future program of a new package of inputs.  The historical analysis shows that any future program of improvements in groundnut cultivation is most likely to find receptive soils among the growers.	In order to provide a clear perspective of the rural employment problems in the area of study, the range of economic opportunities open to the rural people was briefly analyzed and this showed unequivocally that most of the available opportunities are of a subsistence nature largely on account of the generally low level of income of the people.  Since the groundnut crop is produced mainly for the export market, an evaluation of the world markets prospects for the crop was undertaken.  The most important conclusions that emerge from the overall study are:(i)	There is considerable scope for groundnut expansion in terms of both acreage and yield increases.  However, some areas such as the Sokoto and Kano close-settled zones which have high man-land ratios seem to have reached the limit of acreage expansion.(ii)	Shortage of hired labor particularly during the June-July peaked period seems to be a serious bottleneck to groundnut expansion.  Moreover, the subsistence demands of the food crops economy seem to pose a serious problem to groundnut expansion.  A supply function fitted to time-series data revealed that the supply of commercial nuts is inelastic.An analysis of the prospective outlet for groundnuts on the world markets appears to indicate that the present upward trends in the consumption of vegetable oils and oilcakes are likely to continue in future, at least up to 1980.  On the supply side, the production of two major oil-seeds is likely to increase substantially in the next decade.  These are soybean and palm oil.The major problems facing future market expansion for Nigeria’s nuts are (i) increased inroad of the U.S. soybean into the EEC market, (ii) aflatoxin problem and (iii) Nigeria’s non membership of the EEC.|Theses collections|*||||||Oyewale, Adesina Ayobami|M|Economics of Yam production in Ede South Local Government area of Oyo State||||||M.Sc.

The major costs incurred in yam production were the costs of yam sets (31.31%), weeding (19.65%) and land clearing and head making (13.83%).The imputed total income obtained was N4,559.40 per hectare, gross margin, N1,647.75 and the net income, N1,353.98 per hectare.From the results of the fitted cost functions, an output of 185.575 tonnes was found to be the least cost output but the largest output among the interviewees was only 39.29 tonnes.  Output elasticity of cost was computed to be 0.96.The policy recommendations designed to ease the constraints on yam output and income expansion include the expansion of credit facilities to yam farmers to pay hired labour, the intensification of the land clearing programme of the government to assist yam farmers to overcome land clearing problems and use of mechanized ridging, the use of yam heads as planting materials instead of the traditional yam setts and the adoption of chemical weed control technology as a substitute to farm labour which is now either expensive or unavailable in the rural areas.|Theses collections|*||||||Adesominu, Jerome Adejimi|M|Factors related to the adoption of recommended practices for the maize project of the National Accelerated Food Production Programme in Plateau State of Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

In spite of the integrated effort of Research, Extension and Agro-service to stimulate farmers to rapidly adopt the practices, the supply of food commodities continues to fall short of demand.  This raised the question of acceptance of the package of recommendations by farmers.  This study was carried out to determine those factors that might be limiting the adoption of the recommended practices for NAFPP maize project in Plateau State with a view to identifying some of the personal and situational problems and suggesting ways of alleviating them. 	Data were collected from a total of 146 farmers made up of 98 NAFPP and 48 non-NAFPP farmers systematically selected from five local government areas in Plateau State of Nigeria.  The data were analysed using frequencies, cross-tabulation and chi-square statistics.	The data revealed that the personal characteristics of the farmers like age, farming experience, education and family size did not influence the adoption of the recommended practices.  Most of the respondents (96.6%) were aware of the NAFPP and its objectives.  Those who had more contact with extension agents tended to adopt the recommended practices more than those who had less contact.  The primary reasons given by some of the respondents for not adopting the recommendations include inavailability of inputs like seeds, chemicals, fertilizers, and credit facilities.  Monocropping was not practiced by some farmers because the traditional practice of mixed cropping was considered more economic and efficient in the use of labour.	It is recommended that government should improve the machinery of awarding loans and credits to farmers or alternatively, encourage group farming to enable farmers to generate sufficient funds for their farming enterprise.  Essential inputs like seeds, fertilizers and other chemicals should readily be made available to farmers.  It is also recommended that agronomic research on mixed cropping NAFPP crops should be examined with a view to recommending those crops which are suitable to be mixed-cropped with maize without causing yield reduction.|Theses collections|*||||||Adesugba, Raphael  O.|M|A survey of the changing role of the field Administrator in Western Nigeria||||||M.P.A.

The study also reviewed previous researches published in standard texts and learned journals in the area of curriculum studies and language arts.  The analytical techniques used in the study were the t-test and the Chi-square methods of statistical analysis.The result of the study indicated that secondary school students’ performance in English language in the West African School Certificate Examination was better when they also offered Literature in English than when they offered English Language alone.  It was also found out that students who attended older schools, co-educational schools, and urban schools, and offered both Literature-in-English and English language performed better in school certificate examination in English Language, than those who offered the two subjects in relatively younger schools, mono-sex schools and rural schools, respectively.  From these findings, the thesis concluded that secondary school students’ performance in English Language could be enhanced if Literature-in-English is made compulsory for all of them.  It was further concluded that while only qualified teachers should be employed to teach English in all schools, library facilities and co-curricular literary activities should be provided in all secondary schools.|Theses collections|*||||||Adenuga, Rotimi Adewale|M|Silica hardening and its influence on the strength of stabilized soils||||||M.Sc.

Three soil samples were collected from the grassland region, while the others were collected from locations within the forest region.  They were collected from sites located on basement complex rocks excepting the sample collected at Makurdi which lies within sedimentary environment.X-ray diffraction analysis of the soils shows that, they have common mineralogy consisting of quartz, kaolinite, mica, goethite (except sample O) and feldspar (samples R, O and U).The soil samples were mixed with amorphous silica gel to contain 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% of the gel by weight.  These were cured in a humid environment for seven days, and tested for unconfined compressive strengths.The results show that both the maximum dry densities and the compressive strengths increase initially, and later decrease with increasing silica content.This investigation reveals that soil hardening by silica is a function of moisture content.  Removal of water from a soil-silica system is necessary to effect hardening of the soil particles by hydrated silica.  It is concluded that, in laterite soil subjected to percolating wetting and drying phases, the wet phase is the period of consolidation of the deposition and hardening.This study has therefore, shown that amorphous silica is probably a less important cementing medium in laterite soils moisture-rich zones.|Theses collections|*||||||Adeniyi, Dehinde Segun|M|Design typologies of children's centre and application to Ile-Ife||||||M.Sc.Architecture|K.

It is however, realized that a child’s education and welfare during his pre-primary years can so profoundly affect his mental and physical development later in life.  To this end, it becomes necessary to seek ways of improving the existing structure of Pre-Primary Education and Welfare in the state as a way of enhancing a mentally and physically healthy citizenry.Government policy guidelines, statistical and other relevant data are analysed to enable us appreciate the extent of government involvement and the expected standards in Pre-Primary Education and Welfare.  It is then possible to either modify the existing policy and standards, or evolve new guidelines and standards as a way of solving the problems and inadequacies of the existing pre-primary institutions in the state.An extensive field survey, which included the critical evaluation of some existing nurseries and day-care centers, and the physical observation of nursery classes-in-session, was conducted.  This was to highlight the associated problems and inadequacies, and also to derive and integrate possible improvements in both the architectural facilities and general standards.The design concept ensures maximum flexibility and adaptability of the proposal to various locations within the climatic, socio-cultural and economic context of Oyo State of Nigeria.  In full cognizance of the size and psychology of children, architectural schemes of a children’s center are prepared to reflect the special needs of children for play, rest and bodily comfort.  One of the schemes is, thereafter, harmonized with an existing site in Ile-Ife for practical demonstration of its inherent flexibility and adaptability.|Theses collections|*||||||Adeniyi, Olawamiwa Reuben|M|The economics of substence farms in Nigeria: A case study of Oyo -Osun divisions of Oyo State||||||M.Sc.

There is a death of knowledge regarding the practice of subsistence farming to guide policy makers in formulating programmes for its future development.The objective of this study is to find out, the following about subsistence farms in Oyo/Osun divisions of Oyo State of Nigeria:(a)	the cropping patterns, enterprise combination and the nature of costs and returns,(b)	the major variables affecting the farms economic performance,(c)	the farmers’ notion on profitability and to make appropriate problem-solving recommendations on the findings.Cross-sectional data were analysed to evaluate the nature of profitability of subsistence farms and its determinants.  Frequently tables, correlation matrix and regression were used as analytical tools.The results showed that land, is not a limiting factor to farming operations in the study area.  Land operators are predominantly uneducated, old and less energetic to meet the farm labour requirements.The regression analysis results show that the most important income enhancing factors in the study area are increase in farm size, labour cost reduction programmes and an improvement in farming techniques.It was discovered that subsistence farming is not absolutely unprofitable but for the fact that farmers operate at sub-optimal levels.  Farmers believe that farming is profitable by their subjective evaluation and because it satisfies their subsistence needs.Consequently, the following are recommended:(a)	Provision of functional education to farmers in the form of advisory services and organized guidance.(b)	Provision of farm labour complements like fertilizer, improved technology etc. and the requisite technical guidance.(c)	Need for input subsidies, supply of credit and price increases to encourage the farmers as short term measures.  In the long term, there is the need for more research into the economically ideal size of farms and the economies of crop/livestock enterprise mixture to determine the optimum combination level.|Theses collections|*||||||Adenuga, Ehimwenma Enoma|F.|Oragnisational pattern and problems: A case study of a Garment Factory||||||M.B.A. Business Administration|E.O.

Population estimates were the most important determinant of total food imports.Results also indicated that rice, meat and sugar were “high-priced” food imports  having income elasticities of 1.04, 1.10 and 1.23 respectively.  All other foodstuffs were income inelastic.It was also found that with a N1.00 million increase in national income, the marginal propensity to consume imported foodstuffs in Nigeria would rise by a range of between 110 and 5,400 metric tones, ceteris paribus.Consequently, the following are recommended:(a)	income redistribution in favour of the masses and(b)	levying of “purchase taxes” on some of the imported foodstuffs as short-term solutions, while(c)	a food production strategy which encourages small scale farming with emphasis on crop and livestock improvement methods and(d)	population control measures to lower the rate of increase in food demand as long-term solutions.|Theses collections|*||||||Aderibigbe, Olutoyin Tolulope|F.|An Economic analysis of the potentials for the improvement of maize production and marketing among Primary producers in selected areas of Oyo and Ogun States of Nigeria.||||||M.

It is used heavily and in various forms for human consumption.  It is also used extensively in the preparation of livestock feeds and used even directly as whole meals for livestock in the country.Thus, its position in diets and commerce and its potential role in increasing productivity in agriculture, make maize of special interest in tropical Africa generally, and in Nigeria specifically.This research therefore focuses on analyzing the improvement potentials of maize production and marketing in selected farming systems with a view to making general conclusions and hence recommendations which will enhance maize production and distribution in the country.The objectives of the study are:To analyze current, and potential production and marketing of maize in 1979, and to establish the constraints to increasing the production and sale of maize during the same year, in selected localities.  Also, to establish the possible contribution of an early maturing (TZE4) maize variety in these same localities.  These will provide basis for large scale evaluation in similar localities.Secondary data were used to look at maize throughout Nigeria while primary data were collected from three localities in Oyo and Ogun states of the country.  The localities were selected on ecological considerations and on accessibility to the researcher.  One locality, Lagun, in Oyo state, lie in the derived savannah zone where rainfall, which is of paramount importance to maize, is limiting.  The second location, Eruku, in Ogun state, is in the rain forest zone where there is abundant water supply and the third, Mefoworade, in Oyo state, is also in the rain forest zone of the country.Sixty maize farmers from Mefoworade and sixty-six from Lagun were selected randomly while the thirty maize farmers available in Eruku were interviewed.  This gave a sample of 156 farmers.Information was collected on the socio-economic characteristic of the selected farmers’ households, and on their marketing and production activities on maize and other crops within the farming systems.Data were collected by means of questionnaires which contained both open and closed ended types of questions.  Questionnaires were administered by personal interview.Data collected were analyzed by means of cross-tables, frequency counts and regression techniques.The study revealed that labour shortage was the biggest problem farmers faced with their maize production.  Land availability constituted no obstacle to increasing maize production while the use of fertilizer and other modern farming techniques was almost non-existent among the sampled farmers.  Lack of good storage methods and loss in storage are the biggest problems farmers faced with their maize marketing.  Also there is the problem of non-standardization of prices and measuring equipment required for efficient marketing.Thus, there is plenty of room for improvement in the maize production and marketing systems among the sampled farmers specifically and among maize producers in the country at large.The TZE4 maize variety would be beneficial to farmers, especially as the second season crop, in terms of reducing risk of rain failure and insect attack, by maturing early.  It is also beneficial because it comes on to market before the later maturing varieties, thus attracting higher prices.|Theses collections|*||||||Aderibigbe, 'Dayo Adewunmi|M|Prevalence and antibiotic sensitivity pattern of Staphylococcus Aureus isolated from nares of personnel and patients in State Hospital and more Clinic in Ile-Ife||||||F.I.M.L.T.|Morris O.

There was no significant difference in the carrier rate between hospital staff and patents.  However, there were significant differences in nasal carrier rates between housewives and traders.In More Clinic, significant difference in carrier rate was obtained between mothers and children.  Total carrier rates were comparable with other similar studies.On the basis of sensitivity pattern, most of the Staph aureus isolates were resistant to commonly used antibiotics in this country viz: Penicillin G.

The holes were cored to an average depth of about 90.0m.  They penetrated continental sands (Formation A), conformably overlain by a transitional shale/sandy shale sequence (Formation B) and a variably thick sequence of marine shale (Formation C) and finally by the reddish-brown lateritic top soil (Formation D).  Unconformities, micaceous, pyretic and lignitic horizons were recorded within the different units.An average thickness of about 28.7m of bituminous sand was recorded within Formation B.Sedimentological analysis revealed that the bituminous sands are composed mainly of medium to fine quartz grains which are bimodal.  The sand grains are subangular to rounded with the finer grains more rounded.  The sediments are, on the average, moderately to well sorted and display cyclic sedimentation.In all the sediments analysed, only four and one sample fall in the strongly coarse skewed and strongly fine skewed respectively.  Others exhibited mesokurtic to very leptokurtic patterns.Heavy mineral analysis revealed the presence of staurolite, tourmaline, zircon, kyanite, sillimanite mica, hornblende, garnet and augite.  These suggest two probable sources for the sediments deposited.Ages are assigned to the informal Formations which are delineated by the writer.  Because of the presence of Anomalinoides midwayensis, Anomalinoides umboniferous, Bulimina kugleri, Loxostomoides applinae, Chiloguembelina midwayensis, Formation D is assigned to Paleocene age.  The basal (lower) member of Formation C containing Globotruncana gansseri, Rugoglobigerina pennyi, Orthokarstenia parva is dated Middle Maastrichtian while the upper member is dated Late Maastrichtian because of the presence of Globigerinelloides volutes, Lenticulina navarroensis, Heterohelix planate and Heterohelix aff H. striata.An in-situ origin is proposed for the bitumen entrapped in the transitional medium to fine grained sand, while the overlaying and underlying marine organic-rich shales seem to be the hydrocarbon course in the area of study.From the study of the diagnostic microfauna and lithologic characteristics, the basal sediments were deposited in a continental to transitional environment while the upper beds were deposited in relatively shallow to moderately deep water.|Theses collections|*||||||Adeniyi, John Oladokun|M|Suitability of Otun Laterite soil for road construction||||||M.Sc.

Test specimens were prepared from soil materials taken at 2m depth from the Basement complex (Banded gneiss) derived laterite soil.Since plasticity, particle size distribution, California Bearing Ratio (C.B.R.) and Unconfined Compressive strength are the crucial soil properties upon which laterite soil specification for pavement constructions are based, laboratory work on these geotechnical investigations of the soil were examined.  Mechanical Sieve analysis including hydrometer analysis and consistency limits were carried out on the sample.  The clays are classified according to casagrande’s method.Compaction of the soil and cement stabilized soil were carried out using the Standard Proctor equipments.  From the results of the compaction, the optimum moisture content and maximum density to be used in the C.B.R. test were obtained.  Compacted soil and cement stabilized soil samples were therefore tested for their C.B.R. numbers.Cylindrical, remoulded soil samples measuring about 5cm in diameter were compacted and tested for their Unconfined Compressive strength.  Cement stabilized soils, similarly compacted, were also tested for their compressive strength.From the results of the tests, C.B.R. of 20 and 25 were obtained from the compacted soil and compacted cement stablised soil respectively and these values were found to compare favourably well with standard figures.The unconfined compressive strength, although generally gave the low values for all samples, the soil still shows improved strength by adding different percentages of cement.  The consistency limits of the soil were also shown to give limits that can be economically stabilized with cement.  The results of the various tests confirm that the required strength for base and sub-base materials in pavement construction could be achieved with the laterite soil.|Theses collections|*||||||Arhuidese James.

In spite of such plans, there seems to be few cases where their effectiveness does not seem to be felt as much as they ought to in terms of policy impact.  Thus when the material effort at policy formulation and the taking of policy decision is weighed against the impact of the implemented policy, where the implementation takes off at all the cost more often than not usually outweighs the benefit.Usually, attempts at the explanation of the failure of such plans implementation centre on red tape and other defects of bureaucracy.  But it appears that there may be other grounds for explaining such failure and that bureaucracy per se may not after all be responsible at all.The major objective of this study, therefore, is to examine critically why apparently well formulated and adopted policy may fail at the implementation stage using the projects handled by the Ministry of Education Benin as case studies. The study is also aimed at examining ways of dealing with such factors that disturb effective policy implementation.The paper starts with an introductory chapter in which the hypotheses for the study are state; terms and concepts used defined; and the methodology and Bendel State civil service described.  The policy process which serves as the theoretical framework for the study is contained in Chapter two.  Chapter three is devoted to the examination of the policy implementation in the Ministry of Education Benin with reference to the effects of bureaucracy and its defects, and other projects handled by the ministry.  In the analysis, the factors identified as responsible for the failure of policies in the ministry were laid out in chapter four.  For the elimination of the factors what should be done in the form of policy recommendations and conclusion are specified in Chapter five.It is hoped that these findings when supplemented by other similar studies in other pats of the country will be generalisable to the civil services in the country.|Theses collections|*||||||Ariahu, Charles Chukwuma|M|Studies on the quality of canned chicken product||||||M.Sc.

The gross subsurface structure of the piece of land is laterally uniform, hence horizontal, plane three layer models were used to interprete the data.The striking similarity in the curves of the three directions (North-South, East-West and Northeast-Southwest) for each electrode arrangement show isotropism.  Both methods also show a three layer model with the following ranges for the apparent resistivities and thicknesses in four of the seven locations:(i)	the topsoil was found to have fairly low apparent resistivity ranging from 240 ohm-metres to 400 ohm-metre in areas where it became gravelly.  At these locations the topsoil extends to a depth of about 1m.(ii)	In a second layer, a more consolidated or highly weathered part of the bedock, the apparent resistivity was found to vary from 352 ohm-metre to 840 ohm-metre.  This layer extends to a depth of about 8 metres.(iii)	A third layer consisting mainly of granitic bedrock was found to have an apparent resistivity of 2.45 x 103 phm-metre.  It was further observed that the top layer has been eroded at two of the seven locations, hence the depth to the bedrock in these locations is shallower than in the other locations.The results obtained from this study provides information about the electrical homogeneity of the Tonkere area.  This is important in determining the suitability of the area for the earth-current measurements.|Theses collections|*||||||Arua, Arua Eke|M|Some Lexical poblems in the written English of Igbo learners of English as a second language in some selected post - Primary Institutions in Imo State||||||M.A. (E.L.S.)|E.B.

This is done by analyzing the various contract systems (impersonal and personal) between the researchers and the technical staff (field workers); researchers and farmers, and the technical staff and the farmers.Data used for the study were collected from four main sources, the researchers of the N.R.C.R.I., out-station technical officers (field workers), technical staff within the Institute and farmers resident in the four communities of Imo and Anambra States which form part of the Institute’s catchment areas.  Questionnaires and interview schedules were used for data collection.  Frequency counts and percentages were used in the analysis.The findings snow that the relationship between the researches, the AERLS section of the same Institute, the technical staff and the farmers was a loose one.  Besides, the technical staff at the out-station, were not involved in any form of extension services.  The AERLS sends information to the farmers through the NAFPP and the State Ministries of Agriculture.However, these loose associations were attributed to organizational policies and objectives, job descriptions and existing forms of working philosophy; but more fundamentally the orientation of the researchers and technical staff towards dissemination of research findings to farmers.Majority of the farmers interviewed (88%) could not link N.R.C.R.I. with research findings, but as a training centre for agricultural workers.  Also a good percentage of the farmers (62%) confirmed listening to radio programmes on cassava especially during the Operation Feed the Nation campaign.For effective delivery of research findings to the farmers a number of recommendations were made such as, establishing research sub-stations as extension take-off points, including extension objectives in the job description of the field workers, training of generalists, publishing informations to farmers in both English and vernacular and making effective use of existing media such as radio/television and local channels such as songs, talking drums.|Theses collections|*||||||Anyaduba Edwin Tochukwu |M|Equilibrum Solution Phosphorus Requirement of cowpea (Vigna Unguiculata L.

The results of this study were employed to investigate the relationship between equilibrium solution P concentration and P requirement of cowpea in a greenhouse pot experiment.  The sorption curves were used as the basis for fertilizing soils in pots so that phosphate in soil solutions varied from 0-2ppm.	The capacity to adsorb phosphorus varied among soils in the order Owena > Gambari > Mamu > Oba > Iwo (N) > Jago.  The extent of adsorption was influenced by the clay and iron contents of the soils.  When plotted according to the Langmuir equations, three straight-line portions of the isotherm were obtained for IWO (N) soil, two for Jago, Oba and Owena and a single linear portion for Mamu and Gambari soils.	Optimum P uptake by cowpea were achieved at equilibrium soil solution P concentration of 0.12, 0.20, 0.22, 0.27, 0.27 and 0.53 ppm in Gambari, Owena, Mamu, Jago, Oba, and IWO (N) soils respectively.  Optimum dry matter yields of cowpea were achieved in Owena and Jago soils at 0.15 ppm P while Mamu attained optimum yield at 0.2 ppm P. IWO(N) and Gambari soils attained optimum yield at 0.4 ppm P and Oba at 0.5 ppm P.  Oba, Mamu, Gambari and Owena soils with moderate to high sorption maxima, tend to require greater P fertilization for optimum growth of cowpea that IWO(N) and Jago soils.  There was a significant negative correlation (x = -0.92) between phosphorus adsorption capacity (maximum) of soil and the percentage of the adsorption capacity that must be saturated with P to achieve optimum yield.                                             |These collections|*||||||Anyaegbuna Regina Ngozi|F|Studies on Distribution of colouring matter in various granule sizes||||||M.Sc.

A colouring agent, amaranth, was used to represent colouring agents and also possibly to reflect on the distribution of small quantities of ingredients (especially coloured and potent substances) in various granule sizes.	It was found that many variables affect the uniformity of distribution of materials used in granulation and that in each manufacturing process these variables should be identified and controlled.  Two powders, were used: Lactose (solubility 1 in 6) and Calcium Carbonate (almost insoluble).  It was found that there is a critical binder volume for most even distribution of colour in various granule sizes.  The type and concentration of binder were found to be significant.  The use of starches in adsorbing the colouring agent and then mixing with the drug was found to significantly improve the distribution of the colour.  The aqueous solubilities of the powders used also affected the distribution of colour in various granule sizes.  Another factor which showed very significant effects on the distribution of colour is the method of incorporation of the colour but this was affected by the binder, starch and powder solubility.|These collections|*||||||Arogundade Olubayode Akanbi|M|A study of varieties of English in Elechi Amadi's the concubine||||||M.A. ESL|'Niyi Oladeji||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, ESL|1984|||OAU|||||v, 99|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Others are the use of proverbs, linking devices and lexical items/expressions which can be associated with a particular theme.	From our discussion of the different ways in which language has been employed, we also identify two regional varieties of English  The standard British English and Nigerian English.  We consider Nigerian English along the three sub-varieties of the standard Nigerian English, the Interference variety and the Incipient Bilingual variety.  We point out that the Incipient Bilingual variety is sparingly used.	We comment on the problem of language in African Literature.  We also point out the peculiarities observed in Amadi’s use of language in some of his novels, notably The Concubine and The Great Ponds.

This left Morocco and Mauritania in de facto control of the disputed territory.  Since then the Western Saharan problem has been the result of competition between various North African States seeking to occupy the vacuum created by the exit of Spain.  To some extent, the problem still involves decolonization, since Morocco regards the area as part of her territory.  Also, Mauritania until her withdrawal in 1979, regarded the area as belonging to her.  Only Algeria supports an independent Western Sahara from the start.	This study is to find out whether Algeria’s policy towards the Western Sahara is basically motivated by her commitment to the principle of self-determination.  Or, results from such other considerations as Algeria’s need for access to the Atlantic, or from her long-standing conflict with Morocco over regional influence, are also analysed.

Compound sulphonamides were separated by T.l.c.  The most suitable solvent for the densitometric measurement  n-Butanol; N ammonia solution (15:3)  was selected.  Using the above colvent system the best spray reagents was p-N, N-dimethyl amino benzaldshyos in acid medium.  Orange colour was produced with all the sulphonamides.  The coloured spots of individual sulphonamides were measured by the densitometer.  Densitometric determinations of artificial mixtures of sulphonamides and compound sulphonamides (Trisulfan B.P.C. and Sulphatriad) were also carried out.	The results of the assays were subjected to statistical evaluation.  With the artificial mixtures the precision of the method was higher and the standard error less in a mixture with components in the same range of concentrations than in a mixture whose components were in a wide concentration range.  It was also obvious from the results that the sulpha-drugs were differently sensitive to the method of analysis sulphathiazola was more sensitive than sulphadiazine which was in turn more sensitive than sulphamerazine.	The fact that the results of the analysis of the compound sulpha drugs (both artificial and patent) were comparable with declared compositions, shows that the densitometry is applicable to the analysis of these brand of compound sulpha drugs and in fact any other compound sulpha drugs, provided the appropriate solvent system and colour reagents are used.	Photo-degradation on the sulphonamide derived coloured spots was also determined by exposure to laboratory light.  It was discovered that it was better for the plates to be kept in the dark until they were ready for densitometric measurements because there was some degree of photodegradation of the coloured spots on exposure to light after a period of time.|Theses collections|*||||||Adediran Suleiman Adebayo|M|Aspects of the Sedimentary Geology of Bituminous sands (Maastrichtian) Ondo State, Nigeria||||||M.Sc.

They are referred to the Ise, Afowo and Araromi Formations of Omatsola and Adegoke (1980) and are listed in stratigraphic order:7.	Upper Sands and Laterite					) Araromi6.	Upper Shales with interbedded Limestone			) Formation5.	Pyritic Shales							)4.	Upper Bituminous Sands					)  Afowo Formation3.	Oil Shales							)2.	Lower Bituminous Sands					)  Ise Formation1.	Basal Sands							)	The bitumen-impregnated sands each average about 30 metres in thickness.  The sands are, coarse to fine, subrounded, moderately to well sorted and range from sub-mature to mature.  With an average bitumen saturation of 12%, the estimated recoverable oil is put at 31 billion metric tones.	A Maastrichtian age is assigned to the bituminous sands and the overlying pyretic shales on the basis of Afrobolivina afra, Heterohelix striata, Rugoglobigerina rugosa and Dentalina alternate.  The transistion from Late Maastrichtian to Paleocene is placed at 26.0m in BH3, 10.0m in BH24, and 10.2m in BH25 on the basis of the first appearance of Subbotina triloculinoides, Dentalina colei and Bulimina kugleri.	The lithology, heavy minerals, clay mineral types and fauna show a variation in the depositional environment.  The environment ranged from continental when the Basal sands were deposited to near shore, littoral environment in the Lower Bituminous Sands and to fully marine in the Oil Shale sequence.  Shallow, littoral, marine conditions prevailed when the Upper Bituminous Sands were deposited.  There was return to fully marine conditions during the deposition of the limestone bands.	The available data indicate that the bitumen was generated in-situ and the source rocks are the intercalated marine and fluvio-marine, organic rich shales of the Afowo Formation.	Comparison of available data on the Ondo State bitumen deposit with those of other large deposits indicate that commercial exploitation of the tar is possible.  With the development of the industry, Nigeria would attain self sufficiency in both light and heavy oil production. She will also conserve foreign exchange earnings for other major developments.||*||||||Agbata E.C.N.|M|Chemical Quality of water in a Lateritic Environment Ile-Ife and Environs||||||B.Sc.

The central thesis developed is that a knowledge of indigenous conceptions of work is central to a proper understanding of work attitudes and behaviour in Nigeria.  This position derives from an insight into the link between indigenous thought, individual perceptions, and contemporary attitudes and behaviour generated by the phenomenological perspective in sociology.  Specifically, the study collects information on the indigenous conceptions of work among the Igbo, the Hausa and the Yoruba.  It also examines the work and the non-work activities and attitudes of a sample of Nigerian workers drawn from among factory workers, teachers, clerks, managers, and craft workers in the informal sector.	The result of the survey shows that work is the central life interest of a majority of the sample.  It also shows that the workers maintain a close fusion of the work and the non-work spheres of their lives.  In addition, attitudes formed at the work place were found to have no negative generalizing effect on the workers’ involvement in the non-work sphere of life.  These results were consistent with the data derived from the analysis of indigenous conceptions of work among the Hausa, the Igbo and the Yoruba.  This study shows the inadequacies of existing explanations of work attitudes and behaviour.

The Nigerian Coal Corporation was the new form of organization chosen to carry on the management of the coal industry.  In this study- The Administration of the Nigerian Coal Corporation  the purpose is to examine this new organization so as to see how it manages the coal resources of the country.The development of the coal industry is given in Chapter I.  Established in 1950 and invested with a large and varied list of functions, the Coal Corporation claims to have a system of finance on which it blames its ills.  But the financial structure of the organization, examined in Chapter II, though not faultless, does not appear to be the particularly weak link which it has been made out to be.The Administrative structure contained organs  Boards, Committees, Executive Chairman, General Manager, Departments  that carried the seeds of friction and conflict.  One gathers a picture of unplanned but veritable experimentation in organizational machinery.  The organizational malfunctioning which ensued is discussed in Chapters III and IV.The weaknesses of the administrative machinery have been aggravated by the rather belated appreciation by the Government of the needs of the industry for increased productive capacity, diversification of activity and a coordinated and effective fuel policy.  Chapters II and V examine aspects of this issue.  The amount of control exercised by the Minister/Commissioner over the Corporation runs counter to the original idea of independence in personnel and financial management.  With a gradual erosion of this autonomy, a stage has now been reached, as characterized in Chapter VI, where the industry may be said to have reverted to the practice of direct departmental administration form where it took off.However, the Corporation has its successes in its manpower development policy  Chapter IV  and its contributions to the satisfaction of the motive energy and power needs of the country  Chapter V -, before the structural change in the fuel economy of the country set in as oil and gas captured the market.There is room for the improvement of the administrative machinery.  A rationally planned fuel programme in which coal is given a place is also called for.  These recommendations are made in the final chapter.|Theses collections|*||||||Amodu Abimbola Alabi|M|Economic Integration in West Africa: Towards a functional approach||||||M.Sc.

There had been many attempts at integration but it is evident that the experience of Western Europe is not easily amenable to West African situation.  Most Western integration theories are unable to save the situation because West African conditions are radically different from the real situation on which the theories were based.In this condition, and realizing the invaluable need for economic integration among West African countries, the study examines the concept of ‘FUNCTIONALISM’ considered to be a more pragmatic approach to solving problems of economic integration in West African countries.  West Africa with its diverse problems  competition for heavy industrial location, unhealthy rivalries in siting of smaller consumer industries, almost identical primary products and above all, they all depend on agriculture in variable proportion for the economic take off of their countries.Through the concept of ‘FUNCTIONALISM’, we shall examine these problems that militate against successful economic integration in West Africa.  Efforts will also be directed to prescribing solution to some of these problems.  Chapter I of the thesis begins with the framework upon which the thesis is based and discussed further theories of integration.  This is followed by a critical look at the problems and attempts at economic integration in West Africa in Chapter II.  The next Chapter discusses the relevance of Functionalism in West Africa while Chapter IV rounded up the thesis with conclusion.|Theses collections|*||||||Afolayan Moradeke|F.|Attitudes of Ife and Ilesa communities towards the use of mother tongue as a medium of instruction for Nursery Education||||||M.A. ED Curriculum Studies|G.J.

It also investigated the language currently being used in nursery schools and identified discrepancy between policy and practice.  Finally, reasons for this discrepancy were examined.The study sample comprised seven hundred and nine subjects selected by stratified random procedure.  It was made up of 500 parents, 180 teachers, 20 language experts and 9 educational administrators from the Oyo State Ministry of Education.  There were three research instruments used in this study.  These were a questionnaire, an observation guide, and an interview guide.  The instruments were personally administered by the investigator.  Subsequently, the data collected were analysed and used to answer the four research questions corresponding to the objectives of the study.  Descriptive and inferential statistics including the means, percentages and chi-square techniques were used for the analysis of the research questions.The results of the analyses strongly indicated that there were a general preference (76.92%) for the use of English as the language of instruction in the nursery schools, contrary to the intentions of the National Policy on Education.  It was also shown that the reasons for the preference for English primarily included envisaged advantages accruing to pupils in areas of future academic opportunity and performance, financial and employment advantages, and prestige.  Further more, the study indicated that, since parents expected their children to benefit much from early learning of English, they pressured the nursery school authorities to adopt English medium.  Finally, it was observed from the study that the practice of adopting English medium was, by and large, similar in both Ife and Ilesa communities.|Theses collections|*||||||Adeyeye Sunmonu Aderemi|M|The Economics of the cotton textile industry: An Ex-post analysis of Aba Textile Mills Ltd.||||||M.P.A.|Johnson O.

This problem is generally not unconnected with unrealistic feasibility study or poor planning which manifests itself in defective or overambitious plan and/or lack of comprehensive understanding of the business environment in which a particular industry operates.In this study of Aba Textile Mills Limited which is a fully  owned government industrial establishment, two major factors accounted for the poor industrial performance of the Company for the first three years of operation 1971  1974.Firstly, it was found out that the 10 year plan (1971  80) for the Company was over-ambitious, taking into consideration the business environment in which the Company operated from 1971  1976.  In addition, the plan period of ten years was too long and makes the forecasts to be of questionable reliability in terms of accuracy, since the further the plan period, the less details can be accurately foreseen.Secondly, the use of old and obsolete machinery after the Nigerian civil war (1967  70) and inexperienced management accounted in no small measure for the poor and deteriorating performance of the company form 1971  1974 when the company was managed mainly by Nigerians.  The situation was so bad that Abatex could not generate its own funds to meet any of its local and foreign commitments such as interests on loans.  The study further brings out clearly the need for a good feasibility study before the commitment of capital to any industrial  commercial venture.  In addition it shows that the employment of new and modern machinery and appointment of qualified and experienced manager constitute a sine qua non for efficient performance of industrial projects.  This was evident in Abatex as the installation and use of new machines and employment of the New Management Agency (M/S Textile Alliance Ltd. of Hong Kong) led to improved operational performance of the company from 1st October 1974  February 1976.While commending the efforts of the New Management Agency (NMA) in grappling with the Company’s problems the study recommended among other things that the NMA should give adequate training to its staff both locally and at their main factory headquarters in Hong Kong.  It should evolve a salary and wages structure and other incentive scheme comparable to other textile companies in Nigeria.  In addition the NMA should train their Nigerian staff to assume higher responsibilities with the specific aim of taking over the effective management of Abatex not later than 1979 when the management agency agreement terminates.  We believe that if these recommendations are carefully carried out they will lead to greater efficiency in the Company.  On the entire Nigerian textile industry, the study recommended that the Federal Military Government should increase the Nigerian equity participation from its present 23% to 40% through further amendments to the Nigerian Enterprise Promotion Decree of 1972.  It is hoped that this will lead to greater confidence between Nigerians and foreign investors and promote future industrial peace.  In addition the Federal Government should overhaul the present leadership of NEPA to make it more effective in regular supply of electricity to industrial consumers.Finally, it is recommended that the government should encourage the establishment of synthetic textile industries in Nigeria, and also export of locally produced textiles to neighbouring African countries by exempting such products from export duties.  While this will be a first step in export drive, it will load to further expansion of the Nigerian textile industry.|Theses collections|*||||||Aladekomo J.B.|M|Study of Dimer Formation in Fluorescent Organic Molecules||||||Ph.D. Philosophy|J.B.

All the compounds show similar excimer and monomer fluorescence characteristics with a mean excimer binding energy of B  0.2S + 0.03 eV and excimer interaction energy of 0.77 + 0.03 eV.  An exception is 1, 8-dimethyl maphthaleme (B = 0.14 eV), in which excimer formation is sterically hindered.  The monomer quantum efficiencies, rates of monomer fluorescence and internal quenching, and the ionization potentials of the compounds were also measured.The spectra of eleven aromatic liquids were also studied.  The absorption spectra of three of the liquids indicate that the dimmers are unassociated in the ground state.  The analysis of the experimental results shows that the kinetic scheme proposed for pyreme by Furster provides a reasonable description of the excimer-monomer systems.  The fluorescence spectrum of one of the liquids, 1, 6-dimethyl naphthaleme, was measured as a function of temperature, and as a function of concentration in three solvents at room temperature.  The rate parameters, excimer binding energy and entropy change on excimer formation were determined.The excimer fluorescence of 1:2-benzanthracene and three of its methyl derivatives were observed from oxygen-free solutions.  The four compounds have similar fluorescence properties.  The rate parameters for oxygen quenching of the excimer fluorescence have been estimated for solutions of the compounds in cyclohexane.The fluorescence spectrum of 9-methyl anthracene dissolved in benzene was also measured as a function of concentration at 20oC.The factors which may inhibit excimer formation are discussed and the conditions which are likely to favour the observation of excimer fluorescence from solutions are listed.|Theses collections|*||||||Agbede Oluwole Akinyele|M|The Finite Element Analysis of Opa River Dam||||||M.Sc.

They were evaluated with respect to sexual maturity, body weight, egg weight and rate of egg production under similar environmental conditions.The first generation was hatched from the foundation stock without selection.  Chicks were pedigreed to sires, brooded in cages and weighed individually at 4, 12 and 20 weeks.  Egg production was recorded individually from first egg to eight months of production, and weight of first egg as well as means of the weights of eggs laid on the last three days of the first, third, fifth and seventh months of production were taken.  The second and third generations were hatched from parents selected solely for egg production using an index which combined the individual and sire family egg production.  Feed consumption was taken during growth and laying period, and observations were made on certain body characteristics of the Local Chicken such as crests, shank colour feathering, and ear lobe colour.The effects of generation, time of hatch, breed, age at sexual maturity, egg weight and body weight on four and eight month egg production were determined by least squares method (Harvey, 1960).  Two and three way analyses of variance were made to determine the effects of bread, and hatch on feed consumption during growth and egg production.  Estimates of heritability and genetic correlations were obtained from components of variance and covariance.There were significant breed differences in egg production over the first and second generations with the Local Chicken exceeding the Apollo by two eggs at four months and ten eggs at eight months of production.  There were significant hatch of generation differences on eight month egg production, but these were not significant at four months.  Body weight at various ages as well as seventh month egg weight had significant effects on egg production.There were highly significant breed differences in mean annual egg weight with the Apollo producing eggs that were heavier than those of the Local Chicken by about 10g.  There were significant effects of hatch, 20-week body weight and age at time of sexual maturity on mean annual egg weight.  The Apollo were more efficient in feed utilization due primarily to their larger egg weight; and there were significant hatch and breed x hatch interaction effects.Heritability estimates from sire component of variance and response to selection were between 0.09 and 0.27 for rate of egg production; estimates for egg weight were generally low varying from 0.29 at sexual maturity to 0.35 at seven months of egg production.  Genetic correlations between egg production and weight were negative.  Four and eight month egg production were correlated by 0.35.Observations on shank colour in these studies agree with earlier reports that black shank pigment is controlled by a recessive sex-linked gene.  But contrary to earlier reports that crest is due to an antosomal dominant gene, it was found that the presence of crest was due to a recessive sex-linked gene which appeared not to be associated with cerebral hernia.|Theses collections|*||||||Adeyinka Jacob Adeyemi|M|Inulase in the Alimentary canals of Periplaneta Americana and Blaberus Giganteus||||||M.Sc|||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Science|1972|||OAU|||||2, 71|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

Aerobic bacteria-free insect extracts were obtained by injecting aureomycin into the gut of the cockroaches.There was no significant aureomycin effect on inulase production by the insects.  The greatest inulase activity was around the gastric ceaca region.  The major inulase requirement of the insects was met by gastric ceace region production and not by the bacteria.  The assertion that inulase may not be found in animal world (Bernfeld 1962, Doby 1965, Hoar 1966) is unsupported.  Periplaneta Americana (Linnaeus) and Blaberus giganteus (Linnaeus) have inulase in their gastric caeca regions.Studies of inulase could lead to better understanding of cockroach physiology and their symbionts.

It is an emerging and continuously growing field.  One major problem facing University administrators arises from the little body of knowledge and literature available in University administration.  The available materials in the profession has been heavily weighed on the side of what has been termed “cognate experience on the field.”One reason for this problem is the multi-disciplinary nature of University administration, for its areas of operation include, inter alia, student services and welfare, personnel management, general and legal responsibilities, planning and budgeting preparation and implementation.  Worse still, there are fewer materials on decision-making processes and practices in University administration.Decision-making is also on emerging field of study to practicing administrators as well as students of administration and management.  A lot of what has been done in the subject relates to the choice among alternatives, that is the decision itself rather than the processes of arriving at the result that meets the objective.The main intension of examining the decision-making processes in the University of Lagos is to suggest improvement in the decision making methods, processes and administration of the University.The problem of this study, therefore, is to identify and analyse decision-making bodies in the University of Lagos with special reference to academic and financial matters.  The choice of this problem has been motivated and greatly influenced from the point of view of an insider in the University system, a participant observer as assistant Secretary and Secretary to some of the main decision-making bodies in the University of Lagos.  Thus the study will look at the following issues:(a)	the analysis of decision-making bodies(b)	the mechanics of participation in such decision making bodies(c)	the process, method and style of decision making in the University.The method of approach will be mainly by interview with present and past officials/members and senior officials of the University of Lagos decision-making bodies.  In addition, documentary materials in the form of minutes, letters, memoranda, reports, books, journals will be utilized.  Another source of information is from personal experience and observation.	Decision-making in Universities is carried out through the Committee System.  Committees determine what is to be done, who to do it, when, where and how to do it.  Two broad areas of University authority and responsibility are the Council and Senate.  The former is the governing authority with ultimate responsibility for the affairs of the University.  It concentrates on aspects of financial and business management and the maintenance of properties.  The Senate on the other hand, is the supreme academic authority whose activities include the direction, regulation and the promotion of teaching and research and the control of examinations and the award of degrees and distinctions.	In carrying out these duties, both the Council and the Senate have established Committees and sub-Committees.  These committees are made up mostly of academics to the exclusion of administrators.	The need for committees as instruments of decision making would be little when the University is young, small and compact.  Decision-making would require the mechanics of participation through as many committees as are necessary when the University comes of age and when the range of subjects over which decisions are to be taken widens.	The method or style of decision making is determined largely by the situational context.  Depending on the situation, therefore, the style of decision-making could be routine, rational, innovative or incremental.|Theses collections|*||||||Agoi Joseph Taiwo Twin|M|Identification and Treatment of Counselling Problems in ife Anglican Grammar School, Ile-Ife||||||M.

Many problems were equally identified through the interpretation of verbal expressions and attitudes of the students.  Students’ problems were grouped as follows:1. academic and vocational; 2. personal inter-relationship, and 3.health-physical and psychological.Although armed with various counseling techniques, it was decided to be eclectic in treating the identified problems.  Some comprehensive counseling objectives were also set up to guide us, before, during and after each counseling session.In order to help the counselees, I also made use of “hints on How to Study” and “Key-points for Discussion on Vocational Information”.  The letter has two sections: instructions on self understanding and mastery, while the second deals with occupational information.Despite the initial acepticism of many of the students, it was later discovered that their utterances, actions and ways of thinking and attempts to solve their own problems proved much behavioural changes.By the end of our practicum, the following observations were established.  That,1.	Before starting counseling service in any school, the members of staff of that school should be addressed about teacher’s role in guidance and counseling.2.	The parents should be enlightened in the forum of the Parents’ and Teachers’ Association so as to clear off some misconceptions about counseling and guidance.3.	From experience, guidance counselors should give orientation talks on both academic and vocational information to students in schools.4.	Students need a long growing experience on vocational orientation; therefore, schools should introduce means of training students to start considering their vocational career as early as the second or third year in secondary schools.5.	From data collected, it is also discovered that all students both clever and weak, need guidance counseling.6.	For research purpose, evaluation inventories or questionnaires should be used immediately at the end of counseling practicum.|Theses collections|*||||||Arogundade Henry Olumuyiwa Adeyinka|M|Algeria's Policy towards the Western Sahara||||||M.Sc.

This left Morocco and Mauritania in de facto control of the disputed territory.  Since then the Western Sahara problem has been the result of competition between various North African States seeking to occupy the vacuum created by the exit of Spain.  To some extent, the problem still involves decolonization, since Morocco regards the area as part of her territory.  Also, Mauritania until her withdrawal in 1979, regarded the area as belonging to her.  Only Algeria supports an independent Western Sahara from the start.This study is to find out whether Algeria’s policy towards the Western Sahara is basically motivated by her commitment to the principle of self-determination.  Or, results from such other considerations as Algeria’s need for access to the Atlantic, or from her long-standing conflict with Morocco over regional influence, are also analysed.  The background to the conflict, the decision-making process leading to the continuation of the support to the Polisario Front, and the rationale for the Algerian policy are successively considered.|Theses collections|*||||||Aroko Moses Odehnoma |M|Geotechnical Investigation at the Proposed Igbokoda Glass Factory site||||||M.Sc.

If a high level of efficiency and morale is to be achieved, then it is of particular importance that employees receive a fair and equitable amount of pay.  Although wages may not be the primary return that an employee seeks from his job, they are nevertheless of considerable importance to him, particularly as they compare with what other individuals are receiving in the company and in other companies.  If employees develop the feeling that they are not being paid the amount of wages to which they are entitled, even though this feeling is not based upon factual evidence, their productivity and morale may suffer.It is important, therefore, that a company design and maintain a wage structure that will provide a basis for determining, as equitably as possible, the amount of wages that each employee should receive as well as a basis for making him aware of this fact.  This structure should provide the means by which the wages of each employee are related to the work that he performs and to the wages that are paid other jobs within the company and within the industry as determined through the analysis and evaluation of jobs and the conduction of wage surveys.The aim of this study is to provide a remuneration “formula” that will not only equitably compensate the workers of Ilesanmi Press and Sons Ltd., but will also give due consideration to the financial position of the Company such that no strain is imposed on the “corporate purse” as a result of this process of wage determination.

In 1957 Tinklepaugh observed that there is a correlation between structure and epigenetic dolomitization the highest degree of dolomitization being attained in the anticlinal crests.In an attempt to separate diagenetic from epigenetic dolomite in the Ordovician system in the Albion-Scipio field areas, Dr. C.E. Prouty started the first part of a series of studies in 1961.  On the first well core, the Peterson-Howard no.1, Hamil (1961) studied the vertical Ca/Mg variation, Kirschke (1961) the petrographic analysis and Zaitzeff (1962) the microfossil analysis.In this second part of the investigation, the writer studied the Wooden No. 6 well, Hillsdale County, Michigan.  This study consisted of:1.	Detailed chemical analysis using Versenate method.2.	Insoluble residue analysis,3.	Staining, using potassium ferricyanide and4.

The distribution of the pollutants from onboard-engine effluents in the waterways was also examined.  Apart from total oil content, three groups of compounds, namely polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), phemolic compounds and n-alkanes were studied.Bearing the objectives of the work in mind, samples were taken from water-ways having different outboard engine activities.  Activity was measured by noting the number of boats passing in fifteen minutes.  It was also ensured that other major sources of oil pollution would have minimal effect in the water-ways sampled.  For sampling stations reached by boat, midstream, shoreline and bottom-mud samples were collected.  For those reached by land, only shoreline and bottom-mud samples were collected.  Altogether forty-six samples were collected from twenty-one sampling stations along four major waterways of the Niger Delta.  Direct exhaust effluents were collected from three outboard-engines of different capacities: 48 HP and 55 HP (Yamaha), and 50 HP (Evinrude).It was found that outboard-engine effluents constituted a major source of oil pollution in the Niger Delta.  This conclusion was drawn from the following results:  The direct exhaust effluents of the three outboard-engines sampled contained significant amounts of total oil, PAH, phenolic compounds and n-alkanes.  The concentrations of the pollutants in the waterways varied directly with outboard-engine activity.  Fingerprinting of the PAH fractions by fluorimetry showed that most of the PAH in the water samples could be traced to the fuel used by outboard engines.  Synchronous fluorescence of the PAH fractions showed that the types of fused aromatic rings found in the samples were similar to those in the fuel used by outboard-engines.The distribution of pollutants in the waterways was such that the midstream was the least concentrated, followed by the shoreline.  The bottom-mud consistently was the most concentrated.|Theses collections|*||||||Atalabi Tina Atinuke|F|Biochemical and Microbiological Investigations of the production of "Iru" - fermented locust bean||||||M.

Amino nitrogen, total nitrogen, total soluble nitrogen, protease level, reducing sugar, pH and moisture were determined over the fermentation period of 72 hours.  All the parameters were found to increase with fermentation time from zero hour to 72 hours.Thin layer chromatography was carried out on the fermented extract to separate and identify the mixtures of sugars present.  The sugars detected were found to be glucose, maltose, galactose and raffinose.Microbial population analysis was carried out in every 12-hours interval for a period of 72 hours using the viable count method.  Population was found to increase from 1.3 x 101/gm at zero hour to 4.48 x 1010/gm a 72 hours, while pH increased from 5.46 at zero hour to 8.05 at 72 hours.  Microorganisms involved in locust bean fermentation were isolated and identified.  The isolates were determined to belong to the genus Bacillus and Staphylococcus.  The species were identified as Bacillus subtills, B. firmus, B. lentus, B. megaterium and Staphylococcus epidermis. S. epidermis was found not to play any role in the fermentation.Pure culture inoculation with the isolates showed that the most important of the bacterial isolate which accounted for the characteristic “Iru” aroma was B. substilis and to a lesser extent B. firmus and B. lentus, Staphylococcus epidermis have no marked effect concerning the aroma.Sensory evaluation was carried out on the 48 hours, 72 hours laboratory samples and on commercial fermented locust beans using the differential and preferential test to assess the quality of the fermented products.  The result of sensory evaluation showed that the 72 hours laboratory fermented locust beans was most acceptable to the taste panelists.|Theses collections|*||||||Akomolafe Oluwole|M|Environmental changes and organisational survival: A study in the adaptive mechanicsms of a small manufacturing plant (EPEPLY).

These include (i) the basic definition of environment (ii) the environmental features of the case study (EPEPLY) (iii) the dynamic history of the environment and challenges within the system (iv) the ability and potentials of the organization to cope, the strategies or mechanisms adopted and the ultimate result (v) the comparative values of these parameters relative to those that normally feature in developed systems.	Using four methods of data collection (described under methodology) in order to find answers to these intriguing and important questions, the findings show that the organization faces serious survival problems viz. fraud, cut-throat competition depleting timber, shortage of skilled personnel, unstable power supply etc which to a high degree reflect the level of development of the economy.  However, the adaptive strategies adopted by it which include ‘buffering’, smoothing or leveling, ‘bureaucratization’, response evocation and self presentation’, procedure rationalization, ranking of customers, counterveiling aggression etc  are not significantly different from those documented in developed Western Countries.|Theses collections|*||||||Akinmeji Benedict Ibukun|M|Organisation and Management of the Nigerian Ports Authority||||||M.P.A.

Since the present is a result of the past the performance of the Authority cannot be fully appreciated unless something is known about the past operation of the Nigerian ports.  For this reason Chapter ONE examines briefly the various phases of the development of the ports from their fairly remote past until they were taken over by the Authority.The theme of the study is the examination of the operations of the Authority to achieve its goals.  The operations are characterized by a public nature, represented by those who exercise government control over the Authority and a private business nature represented by the Authority’s Management aspects which are referred to as the Authority’s external and internal structures.  How these aid or impede the achievement of the Authority’s objectives are examined in Chapters TWO and THREE.  Chapters FOUR and FIVE discuss the management of the human and financial resources of the Authority respectively.  Chapter SIX, Operational Management, is an examination of how high-level management decisions are taken in performing the statutory duties of the Authority.  Chapter SEVEN attempts the assessment of the achievements of the Authority’s objectives.  It is established that basic deficiencies exist in the Structures and Management Techniques of the Authority which need to be righted.  Some suggestions are offered to this end in the study.|Theses collections|*||||||Atolagbe Folagboye Patrick|M|The Engineering usability of Otun District Lateritic clay and sand in the brick Industry||||||M.Sc.

The clays were pounded and mixed thoroughly with water until they were plastic enough to be moulded into 5cm3 laboratory bricks.  Ash-grey medium-grained sand taken from Otun was mixed 10% by weight with a portion of the pounded clay from each of the areas above and moulded into bricks also.  All the bricks were air-dried and then sun-dried.  Some were selected and fired at 950oC for 6 hours.  Both the sun-dried and fired ones were tested for their strength and durability.The results of the various tests above show that both fired and unfired Otun and Ikun clay bricks and their counterparts mixed with 10% by weight of sand possess both the strength and durability qualities which make them useful for building purposes.  The fired ones are however superior.  On the strength chart, they tend to plot double the unfired equivalents.  Those mixed with 10% by weight of sand tend to resist weathering effect more.  In contesting for strength, however, there is no established relationship between the clay brick proper and the sandy specie.|Theses collections|*||||||Asoegwu Nwabueze Sabbas|M|Determination of some Mechanical properties of Cassava Root Manihot Esculenta Linn||||||M.Sc.

Symptoms of P deficiencies were observed at about six months of growth in the control and those receiving up to 50ppm P.  Vigorous plant growth with no deficiency symptoms, increased height, stem diameter, branch number, leaf number and total drymatter were obtained  for T. ivorensis at treatment combinations of 100ppm N and 100ppm P and 100ppm N and 50ppm P corresponding to N: P ratios of 1:1 and 2:1.  These parameters were also found to be maximum in T.superba at treatment combinations of 200ppm N and 100ppm P, 400ppm N and 200ppm P, and 100ppm N and 200ppm P corresponding to the N: P ratios of 2:1 and 1:2 respectively.Nitrogen uptake in the plant parts increased with increasing N application from 0 to 400ppm.  Phosphorous concentration increased consistently at increasing P application at all levels.  Potassium accumulation in the leaf was found to increase with increasing N treatments.  The results of this work indicate the need to stimulate the growth of T. ivorensis and T. superba through the applications of N and P fertilizers at about six weeks of germination.  For T. ivorensis, single application of 100 to 200ppm N, 50 to 100ppm P and the combination of 100ppm N and 100ppm P produced adequate growth while the application of 200 to 400ppm N, 100 to 200ppm P applied singly and the combinations of 200ppm N and 100ppm P and 400ppm N and 200ppm P corresponding to the ratio of 2:1 produced the best growth in T. superba.|Theses collections|*||||||Aloba Oluwole|M|Some Geographical aspects of rural Transport network in Ife Division Western Nigeria||||||M.

An analysis of the route quality substantiated the fact that an hierarchy of routes exist.  Nodal accessibility hierarchy also exists in the region.  Both the route quality and nodal accessibility are particularly useful in assisting the various governments in planning and executing development programmes designed for rural areas especially in the location of road development and in the spatial distribution of socio-economic facilities so as to reduce urban congestion.|Theses collections|*||||||Asante Kingsley Kofi|M|An evaluation of the Training programmes of the Farm Institutes in Ghana||||||M.Phil Exten.

Among other aspects, it specifically evaluated the curricula and course content of the institutes, determined the adequacy of academic preparations of the institutes for job performance by the graduates, studied some personal characteristics, attitude towards farming as a careers, and occupational aspirations of the trainees.Data were collected from the three Farm institutes, namely, Wenchi in Brong Ahafo region, Asuansi in Central region and Adidome in Volta region, located in the different ecological zones in Ghana.  Structured questionnaires were used to collect data from all the sixteen staff members, one hundred and ninety-two trainees, and one hundred and sixty graduates of the institutions.Data analysis revealed that the trainings offered in the Farm Institutes prepared the graduates well for their job performance, while the curricula and the course-content were adequate for the one year vocational training in agriculture.  Many graduates felt that no course should be removed from the syllabus.The number of teaching staff in the institutes was short of needs, hence courses such as farm mechanization, farmshop and horticulture were not taught.  Most students had urban background and previous farm experience, but the present method of recruiting students only through interview was found inadequate as some students who were unable to write even one sentence meaningfully had been admitted.  Most students aspired to become private farmers.  A positive and significant relationship was found between students’ aspirations and the years of schooling of their parents.  Similar relationship was found between practical experience of teaching staff and occupational aspirations of students.  Only few staff members had high practical orientation.It was recommended that increased financial allocations to the institutes were necessary, particularly to purchase the needed farm supplies and equipment and hire more staff.  An entrance examination should be conducted for prospective students prior to their interviews, while inspection of the land/project sites of private students was considered necessary.  An in-service training programme on teaching skills and development of interest in practical agriculture should also be given to the teaching staff.|Theses collections|*||||||Alofe Clement Oluwole|M|Physiological Studies on Corn (Zea Mays L.)||||||Ph.D. Agronomy|Larry Schrader||Ile-Ife, Nigeria|Obafemi Awolowo University, Agronomy|1974|||OAU|||||x, 112|||||||English||Obafemi Awolowo University, H.

At various intervals after feeding 14CO2, the above-ground portion of the main plant and its tiller(s) was harvested, subdivided into various plant parts, and assayed for radioactivity.  Patterns of translocation from the fed leaf (FL) blade of the main plant or its tiller differed markedly depending upon stage of growth at feeding, the plant part, and the stage of development at harvest.When either the ear leaf blade of the main plant, or the youngest fully-expanded leaf blade of a tiller was fed in young (pre-tasseling) corn, most of the total 14C was in the FL, other leaves (OL), and main or tiller stalk (MS or TS) at 24 hours or 7 days after feeding.  There was little translocation of photosynthate from the main plant to the tiller or vice versa at this stage.When the ear leaf blade of the main plant was fed at silking, the main ear and MS were major sinks for 14C-photosynthate at 7 days after feeding and at maturity.  About 7 and 8% of the total radioactivity was translocated to the tiller at 7 days and at maturity, respectively.  When the tiller ear leaf blade was fed, most of the radioactivity was in the TS after 7 days and at maturity.  The tiller ear (TE) constituted a strong sink at maturity, while only about 4% of the total radioactivity was translocated to the main ear.Source-sink relationships during grain filling were strongly dependent upon the presence of ears on the main plant and/or tiller.  When both the main plant and tiller had an ear, there was little translocation of photosynthate from one to the other.  The developing ear on the fed plant was the major sink.  When only the main plant had an ear, the tiller translocated 70% of its total radioactivity into the main plant, and 51% went to the main ear.  The main plant retained virtually all of its radioactivity.  If the main plant had no ear, only 21% of the radioactivity was translocated to the tiller with an ear.  The MS was a major sink.  However, when the tiller (with ear) was fed, most of the 14C went to the tiller ear.   If both the main plant and tiller lacked an ear, MS or TS was the major sink for translocated 14C from the fed main plant or tiller, respectively.                                                                                                                                                      |Theses collections|*||||||Adebiyi Mallam Abdul-Rabb Ajao|M|A study of Chemical, Physical and Antibacterial properties of Nigerian soft soaps (Ose Dudu)||||||M.

The chemical characteristics of the soaps were observed to vary with the type of oil used for their production.  Variation was also observed in the chemical characteristics of soaps produced from different batches of same oil.  Experiments showed that the soaps contain very high proportions of free alkali which may render them harmful when used on normal skin.  Although the soaps possess excellent foaming properties relative to B.P. soft soap, they are of poor detergent effect compared with the latter.Experiments showed that Nigerian soft soaps and hence soaps generally have intrinsic antibacterial action.  However, the action is not of such level and spectrum that may justify the description of soaps as being germicidal, bactericidal or antiseptic.The soaps exhibited specific antibacterial action against Staph. Aureus, Escherichia coli and  Ps. aeruginosa while Bacillus subtilis and Serratia marcescens were resistant.  The unusual high susceptibility of Ps. aeruginosa was shown to be due to the alkalinity of the soap samples.The action of soaps on the cell membrane of susceptible organism, Staph. Aureus, was demonstrated to contribute immensely to the antibacterial action of the soaps.  The soap caused disorganization of cell membrane leading to leakage of intracellular substances.Palm kernel oil soaps were found to have greater antibacterial action than palm oil and B.P. soft soaps and the likely reason for this is the variations in the proportion of various fatty acid moieties constituting the soaps.|Theses collections|*||||||Adeyemi S.

The series of dimeric complexes f(bipy)2XRu(L)RuY-(bipy)](PF6).2H20 (L is pyrazine; X = Y = Cl, NO2; X = Cl, Y = NO2) has also been prepared.  |Theses collections|*||||||Anschel Kurt Ramon|M|Economic aspects of Peasant Rubber Production in Midwestern Nigeria||||||Doctor of Philosophy|Lawrence W.

Smallholders who grow most of the rubber produced in Nigeria own an average of ten fragmented acres planted with unselected seedlings.  Itinerant laborers whose main interest is maximizing their own short-run gains tap the rubber.  The marketing system discourages production of high quality rubber by paying farmers a uniform price regardless of quality.  The result is low volume production of the lowest quality rubber. The rubber industry is now faced with a declining market for rubber.  Because of competition with synthetics many experts predict a continued decline of rubber prices until the Malaysian price of high quality sheets is approximately 18 cents per pound, about 5 cents less than current prices.The objectives of this study are: (1) to provide a description of the techniques of Nigerian rubber production, (2) to determine the relative profitability of the various organizations now extant, (3) to evaluate the impact of falling world market prices on the profitability of ordinary smallholdings as they are now organized, (4) to evaluate the profitability of farms planting high yielding trees under alternative price and cost assumptions and (5) to suggest methods for implementing change in the rubber industry.Surveys of 111 smallholders in 19 villages in six divisions of Mid-western Nigeria were conducted to determine technology, resources availability and farm organization.  A sub sample of 18 farms were surveyed to determine actual inputs and production of rubber.  Budgets of these farms were then constructed assuming alternative rubber prices and factor costs.  In addition, 30 smallholders who planted clonal seedlings purchased from the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources were surveyed and budgets assuming alternative yields, costs and prices were then constructed.  It was found that all existing organizations of rubber production at 1964 prices and costs provide only slightly more than a #2 per acre income to the farmer.  The most profitable organization, the production of sheets processed in privately-owned factories and smokehouses, yields owners who hire tappers #3 to #5 per annum per acre, and the production of ordinary lump and low quality sheets provides incomes of #2/15/- and#3/14/- respectively.  When rubber prices are decreased 20 percent and domestically produced input prices increased 20 percent, the incomes generated by private processing fall to #1 to #3 per acre and incomes from ordinary lump and R.S.S. VI production fall to #1/10/- and #1/12/- respectively.  At 1964 prices and costs, smallholder rubber production provides approximately the same earnings as smallholder oil palm production, but if rubber prices fall 20 percent and costs increase 20 percent, palm production will be more profitable.Production of rubber from trees purchased from the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources yielding 800 pounds per acre provides and income of over #20 per acre currently and will provide #10 even if prices fall 20 percent and costs increase 20 percent.  At 1964 prices and costs, nature rubber yielding 800 pounds or more provides returns to the economy and owner equal to or greater than oil palms producing 9,000 pounds of bunches.  But if rubber prices fall 20 percent and costs increase 20 percent, yields of 1,000 pounds of rubber must be achieved to exceed the returns from oil palm.It is recommended to the Government of Midwestern Nigeria that its rubber planting program insure yields of 1,000 pounds by continuing farmer supervision and training after planting.  Further, it is suggested that the Government undertake a thorough investigation of the alternative organizations of rubber processing so that when the high-yielding trees are tapped, the most effective organization can be utilized.  Finally, in order to encourage production of higher quality limps and sheets, it is recommended that the Government develop grades for lumps and initiate grading of all rubber produced in the Region.                                                                                                     |Theses collections|*
